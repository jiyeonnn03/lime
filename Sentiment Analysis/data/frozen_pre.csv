1,8,"This is really a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And it's just that a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And basically a fairy tale. One that moms and dads can feel happy to take their children too. Let it be that. Is there anything truly remarkable about it? Probably not. Are the songs particularly inventive or that much different from all the countless other Disney movies? No, not really, but they are catchy and pretty and fit the movie. And the ""In Summer"" song with the snow man in summer is pretty cute, if not a little jarringly placed! But, catchy.Having said that, some people on these reviews are taking this way too seriously. Why would you give it one star just because other people liked it enough to give it a 10? Is that too show how much smarter you are than everyone else? It really shows nothing but taking a carton movie too seriously instead of just going with the flow. It's not real. It's not a real story. It's a cartoon fairy tale.I give it an 8.

2,10,"When people speak of their favorite Disney movies, the big four of the Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion. The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant. Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation. FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.","['people', 'speak', 'favorite', 'disney', 'movie', 'big', 'four', 'renaissance', 'film', 'golden', 'age', 'animation', 'likely', 'mention', 'past', 'decade', 'see', 'disney', 'movie', 'hit', 'miss', 'consider', 'classic', 'forgotten', 'close', 'classic', 'yet', 'frozen', 'change', 'dynamic', 'creates', 'full', 'fledge', 'classic', 'frozen', 'classic', 'disney', 'classic', 'decade', 'could', 'position', 'best', 'disney', 'return', 'root', 'vengeance', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'past', 'year', 'opinion', 'story', 'heart', 'melt', 'fill', 'pure', 'feel', 'heart', 'become', 'staple', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'move', 'story', 'family', 'center', 'unpretentious', 'try', 'portray', 'comedy', 'hit', 'right', 'mark', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'thrill', 'journey', 'make', 'tale', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'exact', 'right', 'amount', 'dare', 'movie', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moment', 'stun', 'provoke', 'others', 'achieve', 'balance', 'true', 'triumph', 'story', 'tell', 'prof', 'exactly', 'disney', 'best', 'prove', 'back', 'produce', 'top', 'quality', 'film', 'affect', 'human', 'story', 'one', 'significant', 'startle', 'stun', 'beautifully', 'envision', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'relevant', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'stun', 'backdrop', 'intricacy', 'like', 'never', 'see', 'environment', 'costume', 'character', 'movement', 'among', 'thing', 'make', 'film', 'gigantic', 'step', 'forward', 'brilliant', 'voice', 'talent', 'breath', 'life', 'project', 'need', 'applaud', 'cast', 'consist', 'kristen', 'bell', 'veronica', 'mar', 'idina', 'menzel', 'wicked', 'among', 'many', 'others', 'bring', 'win', 'charm', 'superior', 'voice', 'act', 'magnificent', 'vocal', 'well', 'heart', 'tale', 'sensational', 'wit', 'humor', 'array', 'different', 'personality', 'emotion', 'triumph', 'fall', 'make', 'interest', 'character', 'people', 'relate', 'best', 'see', 'animation', 'cast', 'fully', 'become', 'character', 'score', 'music', 'perfect', 'score', 'grand', 'sound', 'texture', 'harmony', 'melody', 'class', 'beyond', 'anything', 'attempt', 'animation', 'studio', 'past', 'decade', 'would', 'place', 'song', 'movie', 'enchant', 'true', 'round', 'musical', 'triumph', 'song', 'stuck', 'mind', 'hum', 'even', 'know', 'belting', 'top', 'lung', 'good', 'song', 'progress', 'story', 'essential', 'part', 'meticulously', 'craft', 'breath', 'take', 'animation', 'affect', 'tale', 'bond', 'family', 'romance', 'hilarious', 'wit', 'humor', 'courtesy', 'character', 'especially', 'sweet', 'olaf', 'heart', 'stop', 'adventure', 'true', 'fairy', 'tale', 'would', 'say', 'could', 'well', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'generation', 'frozen', 'disney', 'magic', 'miss', 'long', 'come', 'full', 'force']","[46, 641, 189, 2, 1, 106, 784, 465, 3, 796, 139, 21, 1016, 348, 276, 492, 16, 2, 1, 234, 271, 421, 69, 1017, 351, 69, 182, 5, 209, 988, 797, 246, 2297, 69, 5, 69, 2, 69, 492, 54, 1391, 34, 2, 385, 885, 2554, 34, 38, 3, 276, 47, 258, 12, 80, 359, 481, 724, 53, 80, 179, 1704, 34, 2, 1, 242, 12, 72, 649, 2298, 87, 1018, 279, 234, 130, 820, 345, 1184, 326, 1019, 337, 14, 114, 48, 95, 132, 1392, 130, 624, 1110, 1, 190, 798, 133, 315, 1607, 247, 1531, 677, 62, 989, 12, 143, 909, 522, 2, 34, 799, 74, 587, 239, 283, 3, 1076, 515, 12, 10, 1705, 2299, 315, 529, 2104, 910, 439, 1335, 444, 267, 315, 1821, 1947, 9, 88, 16, 1147, 1336, 8, 886, 471, 43, 14, 3, 2105, 668, 571, 523, 86, 800, 990, 79, 1020, 99, 1235, 227, 2106, 162, 146, 1532, 1533, 141, 116, 678, 471, 61, 247, 221, 374, 235, 1185, 86, 112, 935, 821, 18, 80, 114, 1948, 1455, 222, 2107, 140, 407, 240, 989, 186, 14, 122, 8, 46, 785, 34, 16, 21, 227, 822, 179, 8, 223, 58, 175, 223, 936, 259, 1148, 1608, 1186, 1283, 614, 212, 448, 21, 311, 276, 492, 26, 188, 11, 1, 615, 62, 911, 51, 989, 11, 954, 320, 1048, 28, 56, 1949, 239, 2108, 17, 11, 1149, 12, 1337, 94, 2555, 1021, 990, 55, 21, 1076, 114, 482, 72, 363, 364, 1455, 222, 2300, 8, 121, 457, 32, 80, 284, 326, 62, 219, 114, 26, 35, 54, 18, 48, 422, 149, 203, 616, 5, 2, 150, 271, 169, 40, 246, 272]"
3,5,"First of all, I strongly disagree with any assertions that Frozen hearkens back to the great Disney films of the late 80s and early 90s. The music is nowhere near that level, and the storytelling is not nearly as sharp. Even suggesting that this is the best *since* The Lion King rings false with me. I have not seen every Disney film of the past twenty years, but offhand I can say that Tangled, Bolt and Meet the Robinsons are all far superior examples well-written stories than Frozen. In my personal opinion, of course.Second of all, Frozen definitely skews towards the younger crowd, with little to none of the sophisticated touches or wittily mature humor that have come to be somewhat more commonplace in recent animated films. This one is aimed at the pre-teen crowd. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it is worth noting.The overall story is an interesting one, but the execution is rather sloppy and the narrative meanders a bit too much. The dialog, in particular, is not a strength. Unlike the best films, in which every line and every scene feels both essential and perfect, Frozen is more of a loose joyride. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with that approach, but in my personal estimation, it earns lower marks as a storytelling method.The songs are for the most part unremarkable, and some of the musical sequences suffer from not fully committing to dialog or singing. They just feel hastily-choreographed and not fully thought out. And do not even get me started on the troll song. Yikes.Two of the songs, ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" and especially ""Let it Go,"" do work very well. The latter ties into what is unquestionably the best scene in the film on every level. It provides the one glimpse of true majesty, the sort of quality that would explain all of the extremely positive ""this is the greatest"" reviews that are being posted by others. Unfortunately, the film descends most of the way back into mediocrity after that scene.On the positive front, however, Frozen offers a fantastic, gorgeous take on the visual elements of winter. Deep blue ice, snowflakes, white mountains contrasting with colored skies. It is an unspeakably lovely display of a subject matter than CGI animation has never (in my experience) turned its energies to before, at least not like this. Of course, it goes without saying that all of the animation in Frozen, characters and landscapes alike, is excellent.For me, Tangled was much more satisfying than Frozen. I applaud Disney for honing their CGI skills, and for finally adapting The Snow Queen to screen. I just wish that they would have spent more time on the script.With films like this one, a distinction needs to be made between loving it for the visceral takeaway (""it was sweet""/""it had a great message""/""it made me feel good"") and looking at it from a critical standpoint. Now, I understand that one needs to just ""forget about being critical"" and enjoy a film - for me, the best films take care of that themselves. It is the ones, like Frozen, that seem like they clearly could have been much better, that get me thinking about just that.This film is a fun one for kids, and great to look at for adults, but it is far short of being great, or a masterpiece. More focus on an truly excellent story, and it might have been.","['first', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'assertion', 'frozen', 'hearkens', 'back', 'great', 'disney', 'film', 'late', 'early', 'music', 'nowhere', 'near', 'level', 'storytelling', 'nearly', 'sharp', 'even', 'suggest', 'best', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'ring', 'false', 'see', 'every', 'disney', 'film', 'past', 'twenty', 'year', 'offhand', 'say', 'tangle', 'bolt', 'meet', 'robinson', 'far', 'superior', 'example', 'well', 'write', 'story', 'frozen', 'personal', 'opinion', 'course', 'second', 'frozen', 'definitely', 'skews', 'towards', 'young', 'crowd', 'little', 'none', 'sophisticated', 'touch', 'wittily', 'mature', 'humor', 'come', 'somewhat', 'commonplace', 'recent', 'animate', 'film', 'one', 'aim', 'pre', 'teen', 'crowd', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'worth', 'note', 'overall', 'story', 'interest', 'one', 'execution', 'rather', 'sloppy', 'narrative', 'meander', 'bit', 'much', 'dialog', 'particular', 'strength', 'unlike', 'best', 'film', 'every', 'line', 'every', 'scene', 'feel', 'essential', 'perfect', 'frozen', 'loose', 'joyride', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'approach', 'personal', 'estimation', 'earns', 'low', 'mark', 'storytelling', 'method', 'song', 'part', 'unremarkable', 'musical', 'sequence', 'suffer', 'fully', 'commit', 'dialog', 'sing', 'feel', 'hastily', 'choreographed', 'fully', 'thought', 'even', 'get', 'start', 'troll', 'song', 'yikes', 'two', 'song', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'especially', 'let', 'go', 'work', 'well', 'latter', 'tie', 'unquestionably', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'every', 'level', 'provide', 'one', 'glimpse', 'true', 'majesty', 'sort', 'quality', 'would', 'explain', 'extremely', 'positive', 'great', 'review', 'post', 'others', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'descends', 'way', 'back', 'mediocrity', 'scene', 'positive', 'front', 'however', 'frozen', 'offer', 'fantastic', 'gorgeous', 'take', 'visual', 'element', 'winter', 'deep', 'blue', 'ice', 'snowflake', 'white', 'mountain', 'contrast', 'color', 'sky', 'unspeakably', 'lovely', 'display', 'subject', 'matter', 'cgi', 'animation', 'never', 'experience', 'turn', 'energy', 'least', 'like', 'course', 'go', 'without', 'say', 'animation', 'frozen', 'character', 'landscape', 'alike', 'excellent', 'tangle', 'much', 'satisfy', 'frozen', 'applaud', 'disney', 'hone', 'cgi', 'skill', 'finally', 'adapt', 'snow', 'queen', 'screen', 'wish', 'would', 'spent', 'time', 'script', 'film', 'like', 'one', 'distinction', 'need', 'make', 'love', 'visceral', 'takeaway', 'sweet', 'great', 'message', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'look', 'critical', 'standpoint', 'understand', 'one', 'need', 'forget', 'critical', 'enjoy', 'film', 'best', 'film', 'take', 'care', 'one', 'like', 'frozen', 'seem', 'like', 'clearly', 'could', 'much', 'well', 'get', 'think', 'film', 'fun', 'one', 'kid', 'great', 'look', 'adult', 'far', 'short', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'focus', 'truly', 'excellent', 'story', 'might']","[36, 1456, 2109, 4003, 5, 4004, 74, 25, 2, 3, 530, 594, 58, 801, 449, 440, 689, 501, 2556, 28, 1049, 34, 98, 152, 97, 2110, 1950, 16, 115, 2, 3, 276, 1393, 47, 4005, 35, 83, 1951, 244, 2301, 142, 1185, 396, 18, 165, 12, 5, 537, 258, 228, 319, 5, 174, 4006, 538, 73, 1150, 48, 679, 2302, 260, 4007, 1022, 222, 40, 572, 3339, 399, 38, 3, 10, 859, 1394, 1457, 1150, 1284, 65, 43, 254, 625, 166, 12, 122, 10, 1534, 191, 2111, 802, 4008, 95, 31, 1187, 650, 887, 766, 34, 3, 115, 213, 115, 90, 53, 1337, 175, 5, 937, 4009, 156, 2557, 280, 1111, 537, 4010, 2911, 1023, 820, 689, 3340, 11, 94, 2303, 51, 502, 888, 822, 2912, 1187, 63, 53, 2304, 4011, 822, 92, 28, 19, 120, 123, 11, 3341, 42, 11, 59, 202, 45, 121, 30, 13, 107, 18, 955, 1609, 3342, 34, 90, 3, 115, 440, 458, 10, 2558, 62, 3343, 539, 283, 26, 400, 423, 503, 25, 161, 1285, 247, 573, 3, 4012, 50, 74, 4013, 90, 503, 938, 110, 5, 705, 253, 444, 55, 450, 401, 105, 574, 991, 33, 1112, 365, 214, 956, 651, 1395, 4014, 765, 1151, 1822, 375, 555, 21, 88, 334, 113, 1338, 250, 9, 228, 13, 137, 35, 21, 5, 8, 889, 725, 298, 83, 31, 1188, 5, 1235, 2, 3344, 555, 1610, 241, 912, 39, 49, 369, 417, 26, 992, 20, 395, 3, 9, 10, 4015, 99, 14, 6, 3345, 4016, 457, 25, 185, 14, 53, 17, 66, 1458, 2112, 216, 10, 99, 746, 1458, 91, 3, 34, 3, 55, 293, 10, 9, 5, 75, 9, 690, 54, 31, 18, 19, 37, 3, 125, 10, 60, 25, 66, 147, 142, 263, 25, 461, 261, 329, 298, 12, 252]"

9,9,"Walt Disney Animation gives Hans Christian Andersen's story, ""The Snow Queen"", their own take by rather telling it as a traditional Disney princess movie, since it's probably too difficult for the original story to a have a faithful film adaptation. The film, like any of the genre's classics, is purely delightful and undeniably heartwarming. Putting all of its traditional elements is no doubt its best feat. It's probably a little too swift and somewhat predictable, but it always hits at the right heart and it really felt genuine. Frozen is getting there as one of Disney's classics, but despite of some flaws, it's difficult to not love the film overall.The major part of the story that has changed is it's now about a relationship of two sisters. It's an interesting choice for the plot, providing more themes to fit to the other. There is a sense that it might break some grounds to the usual form of the genre, though halfway through the film somewhat follows the same mold, which there's the typical fairy tale question about what true love really is, but eventually it manages to deliver something much clever in the end. Instead of fulfilling romantic dreams, it rather acknowledges how powerful real love can bring. It's sometimes a bit obvious, but that certain kind of heart feels quite sincere and it triumphs for it. Whatever else is left about the storytelling is it needs to work more on its pacing. It seems too quick, though animated movies have always been into faster pace, but this one palpably doesn't have enough time for breathing unless it importantly needed to. It's a very minor thing to complain about, but it's hard to avoid noticing it.One thing that it never fails recapturing is definitely the traditional magic. All the things you loved are right here!: great characters, adventurous tone, and magnificent musical numbers.The film benefits by its cast: Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel are both admirable as Anna and Elsa, while the rest are also full of personality. What brings it to the table even more are the songs. There is a sense of Broadway indeed, blending it with its wondrous animation makes it more captivating. The most memorable among is the ""Let It Go"" scene that brings a lot of impact, it's easily the best of its musical set pieces, giving a grand scale of bombast and emotion. The rest of the plot are just comedy and action, but the film has a better core which made these parts the least of what we should talk about.There's plenty of magic and heart to be found in Frozen, in spite of a slight mess through the storytelling. As an adaptation, it is able to be inventive, otherwise it's simply a lovely fairy tale movie that has the charm of the old Disney classics, but really, it's not in those heights yet. It's just a reminder that these movies can still wake up our inner child no matter what age we're in. I mean, why doubt quality?; rich setting, compelling characters, and all. Having these kinds of cinematic experience always feels like a rewarding treat. There are also remarkable songs that are worth listening within its visual splendor. And so, Frozen turns out to be as spectacular as we wanted to be.","['walt', 'disney', 'animation', 'give', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'take', 'rather', 'tell', 'traditional', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'since', 'probably', 'difficult', 'original', 'story', 'faithful', 'film', 'adaptation', 'film', 'like', 'genre', 'classic', 'purely', 'delightful', 'undeniably', 'heartwarming', 'put', 'traditional', 'element', 'doubt', 'best', 'feat', 'probably', 'little', 'swift', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'always', 'hit', 'right', 'heart', 'really', 'felt', 'genuine', 'frozen', 'get', 'one', 'disney', 'classic', 'despite', 'flaw', 'difficult', 'love', 'film', 'overall', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'change', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'interest', 'choice', 'plot', 'provide', 'theme', 'fit', 'sense', 'might', 'break', 'ground', 'usual', 'form', 'genre', 'though', 'halfway', 'film', 'somewhat', 'follow', 'mold', 'typical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'question', 'true', 'love', 'really', 'eventually', 'manages', 'deliver', 'something', 'much', 'clever', 'end', 'instead', 'fulfil', 'romantic', 'dream', 'rather', 'acknowledges', 'powerful', 'real', 'love', 'bring', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'obvious', 'certain', 'kind', 'heart', 'feel', 'quite', 'sincere', 'triumph', 'whatever', 'else', 'left', 'storytelling', 'need', 'work', 'pace', 'seem', 'quick', 'though', 'animate', 'movie', 'always', 'faster', 'pace', 'one', 'palpably', 'enough', 'time', 'breathing', 'unless', 'importantly', 'need', 'minor', 'thing', 'complain', 'hard', 'avoid', 'notice', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'fails', 'recapture', 'definitely', 'traditional', 'magic', 'thing', 'love', 'right', 'great', 'character', 'adventurous', 'tone', 'magnificent', 'musical', 'number', 'film', 'benefit', 'cast', 'kristen', 'bell', 'idina', 'menzel', 'admirable', 'anna', 'elsa', 'rest', 'also', 'full', 'personality', 'brings', 'table', 'even', 'song', 'sense', 'broadway', 'indeed', 'blending', 'wondrous', 'animation', 'make', 'captivate', 'memorable', 'among', 'let', 'go', 'scene', 'brings', 'lot', 'impact', 'easily', 'best', 'musical', 'set', 'piece', 'give', 'grand', 'scale', 'bombast', 'emotion', 'rest', 'plot', 'comedy', 'action', 'film', 'well', 'core', 'make', 'part', 'least', 'talk', 'plenty', 'magic', 'heart', 'found', 'frozen', 'spite', 'slight', 'mess', 'storytelling', 'adaptation', 'able', 'inventive', 'otherwise', 'simply', 'lovely', 'fairy', 'tale', 'movie', 'charm', 'old', 'disney', 'classic', 'really', 'height', 'yet', 'reminder', 'movie', 'still', 'wake', 'inner', 'child', 'matter', 'age', 'mean', 'doubt', 'quality', 'rich', 'set', 'compelling', 'character', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'always', 'feel', 'like', 'reward', 'treat', 'also', 'remarkable', 'song', 'worth', 'listen', 'within', 'visual', 'splendor', 'frozen', 'turn', 'spectacular', 'want']","[410, 2, 21, 57, 44, 245, 339, 12, 39, 49, 55, 191, 143, 462, 2, 29, 1, 98, 210, 1113, 230, 12, 2561, 3, 891, 3, 9, 768, 69, 2115, 1459, 2916, 803, 196, 462, 401, 681, 34, 2307, 210, 48, 2917, 572, 331, 163, 234, 130, 80, 22, 155, 1342, 5, 19, 10, 2, 69, 313, 386, 1113, 6, 3, 166, 823, 94, 12, 209, 153, 42, 15, 122, 862, 52, 458, 226, 560, 217, 252, 340, 1051, 562, 427, 768, 100, 1612, 3, 572, 378, 2308, 376, 219, 114, 824, 62, 6, 22, 652, 825, 1050, 89, 31, 691, 41, 208, 2116, 393, 626, 191, 4021, 439, 195, 6, 221, 504, 95, 595, 563, 193, 80, 53, 124, 2562, 989, 653, 270, 330, 689, 99, 107, 564, 75, 1191, 100, 38, 1, 163, 2563, 564, 10, 4022, 164, 20, 2918, 959, 1398, 99, 670, 43, 1460, 307, 863, 692, 10, 43, 88, 1052, 2919, 174, 462, 150, 43, 6, 130, 25, 8, 1710, 627, 935, 51, 184, 3, 1711, 227, 162, 146, 141, 116, 1826, 7, 4, 303, 27, 246, 407, 509, 1461, 28, 11, 217, 411, 826, 2920, 2309, 21, 14, 1024, 268, 471, 30, 13, 90, 509, 84, 1153, 403, 34, 51, 144, 588, 57, 936, 1827, 240, 303, 52, 279, 345, 3, 18, 1399, 14, 94, 250, 178, 727, 150, 80, 231, 5, 1956, 2117, 1025, 689, 891, 294, 1819, 827, 341, 765, 219, 114, 1, 235, 64, 2, 69, 22, 2118, 182, 3348, 1, 68, 1238, 1154, 70, 375, 139, 218, 681, 283, 1613, 144, 1239, 8, 193, 2921, 334, 163, 53, 9, 2564, 682, 27, 1530, 11, 254, 531, 654, 450, 2922, 5, 113, 671, 59]"

Now, i know that this is a movie for children although i don't know what rating it has, but all the hype that this is getting and the way it was promoted to me on the internet including this website, it was just absurd. I read people making insane statements like ""this is the best animated movie ever made"", i saw that it was rated 8 on IMDb, staying strong on the top 10 for weeks or months now, and it got nominated for an Oscar and it even won it, that just cant be ignored, i felt forced to watch it. Therefore i feel i have the right to review it as an adult, but i'm also going to say what my opinion could have been if i had seen this as a child.Keeping it as short as possible:Story: Its just terrible. Situations created out of nowhere, it feels incredibly fake, its inconsistent and it has no logic at all. As a kid i think i would have tolerated the unexplained and dumb situations but i still would have thought its a dull movie. Although i think little girls might find it very entertaining.Screenplay: Even worse, for all i know it could have been written by someone who is 10 years old, not worth saying many words about it. There is a funny side in the movie but definitely is not because of the screenplay.Music: Oh yeah, keep in mind that this is a musical, expect them to start singing out of nowhere in any moment. The songs sound all the same, show tunes with stupid lyrics like ""Be the good girl you always have to be..."". It was a torture every time they started singing anything. Animation: There are some nice and panoramic landscapes in the background, probably the best side of the movie but still nothing incredible.Character design: Just terrible. They still keep using these doll looking style that makes the characters look unreal and soulless. I was still a kid when this kind of animation started and i never enjoyed it. I thought it looked kinda cool at first but still there was something empty in it. All i have left from them now are just a cold memories, like i was watching movies without characters. They're just plain ugly.Its been done for 20 years now, its time to stop with this realistic computerized animation thing. Animated movies are not meant to be realistic, their strongest point are their unlimited possibilities to illustrate stories and take them beyond reality. It got old now and they are all starting to look the same. Just go back to 2D animation or move forward and make something new and innovative but please somebody put an end to this crap.From the point of view of a little girl it might be an enjoyable film, but its a disgrace that they nominated it for an Oscar while they keep ignoring good movies like they've done in the past with Perfect Blue, Animatrix, The Grave of the Fireflies, and the list goes on. This just isn't material for the Oscars. I could go up to 3 but i'm going to rate it 1 because of how much people are overrating it.","['huge', 'fan', 'animation', 'past', 'consider', 'art', 'form', 'equal', 'type', 'entertainment', 'like', 'movie', 'book', 'music', 'painting', 'etc', 'always', 'hat', 'animation', 'stigmatize', 'childish', 'immature', 'know', 'movie', 'child', 'although', 'know', 'rating', 'hype', 'get', 'way', 'promote', 'internet', 'include', 'website', 'absurd', 'read', 'people', 'make', 'insane', 'statement', 'like', 'best', 'animate', 'movie', 'ever', 'make', 'saw', 'rat', 'imdb', 'stay', 'strong', 'top', 'week', 'month', 'get', 'nominate', 'oscar', 'even', 'cant', 'ignore', 'felt', 'force', 'watch', 'therefore', 'feel', 'right', 'review', 'adult', 'also', 'go', 'say', 'opinion', 'could', 'see', 'child', 'keep', 'short', 'possible', 'story', 'terrible', 'situation', 'create', 'nowhere', 'feel', 'incredibly', 'fake', 'inconsistent', 'logic', 'kid', 'think', 'would', 'tolerate', 'unexplained', 'dumb', 'situation', 'still', 'would', 'thought', 'dull', 'movie', 'although', 'think', 'little', 'girl', 'might', 'find', 'entertain', 'screenplay', 'even', 'bad', 'know', 'could', 'write', 'someone', 'year', 'old', 'worth', 'say', 'many', 'word', 'funny', 'side', 'movie', 'definitely', 'screenplay', 'music', 'oh', 'yeah', 'keep', 'mind', 'musical', 'expect', 'start', 'sing', 'nowhere', 'moment', 'song', 'sound', 'show', 'tune', 'stupid', 'lyric', 'like', 'good', 'girl', 'always', 'torture', 'every', 'time', 'start', 'sing', 'anything', 'animation', 'nice', 'panoramic', 'landscape', 'background', 'probably', 'best', 'side', 'movie', 'still', 'nothing', 'incredible', 'character', 'design', 'terrible', 'still', 'keep', 'use', 'doll', 'look', 'style', 'make', 'character', 'look', 'unreal', 'soulless', 'still', 'kid', 'kind', 'animation', 'start', 'never', 'enjoy', 'thought', 'look', 'kinda', 'cool', 'first', 'still', 'something', 'empty', 'left', 'cold', 'memory', 'like', 'watch', 'movie', 'without', 'character', 'plain', 'ugly', 'year', 'time', 'stop', 'realistic', 'computerize', 'animation', 'thing', 'animate', 'movie', 'meant', 'realistic', 'strong', 'point', 'unlimited', 'possibility', 'illustrate', 'story', 'take', 'beyond', 'reality', 'get', 'old', 'start', 'look', 'go', 'back', 'animation', 'move', 'forward', 'make', 'something', 'new', 'innovative', 'please', 'somebody', 'put', 'end', 'crap', 'point', 'view', 'little', 'girl', 'might', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'disgrace', 'nominate', 'oscar', 'keep', 'ignore', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'past', 'perfect', 'blue', 'animatrix', 'grave', 'firefly', 'list', 'go', 'material', 'oscar', 'could', 'go', 'go', 'rate', 'much', 'people', 'overrate']","[360, 176, 21, 276, 421, 749, 427, 1718, 524, 839, 9, 1, 596, 58, 1719, 430, 163, 606, 21, 1156, 2570, 56, 1, 70, 255, 56, 437, 406, 19, 50, 1829, 1720, 349, 1960, 547, 46, 14, 2316, 2571, 9, 34, 38, 1, 81, 14, 157, 1055, 866, 510, 167, 239, 1078, 860, 19, 1463, 302, 28, 1961, 1079, 155, 272, 23, 1241, 53, 130, 161, 147, 27, 13, 35, 258, 54, 16, 70, 154, 263, 673, 12, 432, 867, 134, 801, 53, 603, 1537, 3350, 1464, 60, 37, 26, 3351, 1401, 1157, 867, 68, 26, 92, 1026, 1, 255, 37, 48, 76, 252, 71, 243, 1027, 28, 65, 56, 54, 165, 304, 47, 64, 254, 35, 61, 548, 85, 387, 1, 174, 1027, 58, 425, 830, 154, 320, 51, 131, 120, 63, 801, 133, 11, 259, 78, 804, 494, 475, 9, 17, 76, 163, 1614, 115, 20, 120, 63, 212, 21, 192, 889, 617, 210, 34, 387, 1, 68, 156, 549, 8, 424, 432, 68, 154, 158, 1287, 66, 355, 14, 8, 66, 4029, 68, 60, 193, 21, 120, 88, 91, 92, 66, 629, 556, 36, 68, 89, 1538, 330, 366, 412, 9, 23, 1, 137, 8, 915, 2317, 47, 20, 284, 640, 3352, 21, 43, 38, 1, 868, 640, 167, 117, 3353, 2123, 3354, 12, 55, 614, 940, 19, 64, 120, 66, 13, 74, 21, 242, 571, 14, 89, 108, 1831, 576, 1832, 196, 41, 1114, 117, 413, 48, 76, 252, 306, 3, 2318, 1463, 302, 154, 1079, 17, 1, 9, 276, 175, 991, 2124, 550, 13, 1080, 302, 54, 13, 13, 694, 31, 46, 426]"

I'm not so much picky about plot and don't nitpick too much when it comes to children's movies, but this movie was so far below par for Disney it's unbelievable. There is very little character development throughout the feature, I find that at the end of the movie I couldn't care less about the heroines or their relationship. I also agree that this music is hurting for substance. The songs aren't memorable at all...unless you've seen it a billion times. I'm also disappointed at the lack of interest Disney has in developing compelling male characters. This movie felt like a huge dig on men I'm general, either they're stupid or scheming or nondescript. There's no substantial male figure in it at all, and I get that the focus was on the female protagonists, but I felt it was a huge disservice to the other gender in general.And the ""you're a snowflake"" undercurrent is getting very verrry old. Seriously. It portrays feelings as the ultimate compass for people (I.e. Elsa's character) ""just go with how you feel and everything will be great yo!!"" Yeah... Not so much.

18,10,"It's no surprise that Disney has pulled out a new movie for the Disney Animated Features canon. Hastily, I checked out the film on opening day and had to see if what the critics said were true.In a place called Arendelle, two sisters of royal heritage live a splendid life, until one day the older sister Elsa has difficulty controlling her cryokinesis (ice powers) that it ultimately strikes her own sister Anna, endangering her young sibling and herself. With their parents gone and fearing she may do more harm than good, Elsa flees Arendelle to start a new life at the cost of leaving her caring sister behind.Since the film is loosely based on the works of Hans Christian Andersen (author of the story 'The Little Mermaid' which Disney eventually adapted back in 1989), I acknowledge that the critics were right and Disney has one-upped themselves with a compelling and heartfelt story of how the Snow Queen came to be. The voice cast which include Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, and Johnathan Groff portrayed characters with such ease and likability along with their unique talent in singing sympathetic, yet upbeat songs that may give chills (no pun intended) running down your spine most notably Idina Menzel's solo of ""Let it Go."" That is the exact impression I felt as a kid watching those classic Disney animated films like 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin,' and 'The Lion King.' Now in my mid-20s and with this new ""Revival Era,"" it seems 'Frozen' is matching the ranks of the Disney Renaissance that spawned those animated hits throughout the 1990s. I felt a strong sympathy for these royal sisters of Arendelle. Anna cares very much for her troubled sister no matter what, and she'll do anything to strengthen their childhood bond again. The story itself intrigued me the most (even with an unexpected twist near the end, but I won't spoil it there) because it's basically the theme of ""a bond long-since broken by fear and uncertainty, tries to be rekindled with the power of love and compassion."" I literally heard the audience laugh, react, loudly applaud, and cheer that I can already sense Oscar nominations will not be ruled out. And on a personal note, it's good to point out that there are a few easter eggs referencing past Disney animated films hidden in some scenes, something that's been done since Walt Disney's lifetime and can be surprising if found. No doubt the DVD/Blu-ray release will also be a hit. A definite return to Disney's heyday of animation glory that happened over twenty years ago. 'Frozen' is a movie audiences - kids and adults young at heart - can relate to.","['surprise', 'disney', 'pull', 'new', 'movie', 'disney', 'animate', 'feature', 'canon', 'hastily', 'checked', 'film', 'opening', 'day', 'see', 'critic', 'say', 'true', 'place', 'call', 'arendelle', 'two', 'sister', 'royal', 'heritage', 'live', 'splendid', 'life', 'one', 'day', 'old', 'sister', 'elsa', 'difficulty', 'control', 'cryokinesis', 'ice', 'power', 'ultimately', 'strike', 'sister', 'anna', 'endanger', 'young', 'sibling', 'parent', 'go', 'fear', 'may', 'harm', 'good', 'elsa', 'flees', 'arendelle', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'cost', 'leave', 'care', 'sister', 'behind', 'since', 'film', 'loosely', 'base', 'work', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'author', 'story', 'little', 'mermaid', 'disney', 'eventually', 'adapt', 'back', 'acknowledge', 'critic', 'right', 'disney', 'one', 'upped', 'compelling', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'come', 'voice', 'cast', 'include', 'kristen', 'bell', 'idina', 'menzel', 'josh', 'gad', 'johnathan', 'groff', 'portrayed', 'character', 'ease', 'likability', 'along', 'unique', 'talent', 'sing', 'sympathetic', 'yet', 'upbeat', 'song', 'may', 'give', 'chill', 'pun', 'intend', 'run', 'spine', 'notably', 'idina', 'menzel', 'solo', 'let', 'go', 'exact', 'impression', 'felt', 'kid', 'watch', 'classic', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'like', 'beauty', 'beast', 'aladdin', 'lion', 'king', 'mid', 'new', 'revival', 'era', 'seem', 'frozen', 'match', 'rank', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'spawn', 'animate', 'hit', 'throughout', 'felt', 'strong', 'sympathy', 'royal', 'sister', 'arendelle', 'anna', 'care', 'much', 'troubled', 'sister', 'matter', 'anything', 'strengthen', 'childhood', 'bond', 'story', 'intrigue', 'even', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'near', 'end', 'spoil', 'basically', 'theme', 'bond', 'long', 'since', 'broken', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'try', 'rekindle', 'power', 'love', 'compassion', 'literally', 'heard', 'audience', 'laugh', 'react', 'loudly', 'applaud', 'cheer', 'already', 'sense', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'rule', 'personal', 'note', 'good', 'point', 'easter', 'egg', 'reference', 'past', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'hidden', 'scene', 'something', 'since', 'walt', 'disney', 'lifetime', 'surprising', 'found', 'doubt', 'dvd', 'blu', 'ray', 'release', 'also', 'hit', 'definite', 'return', 'disney', 'heyday', 'animation', 'glory', 'happen', 'twenty', 'year', 'ago', 'frozen', 'movie', 'audience', 'kid', 'adult', 'young', 'heart', 'relate']","[445, 2, 695, 108, 1, 2, 38, 229, 1541, 2304, 2930, 3, 631, 138, 16, 730, 35, 62, 188, 308, 199, 42, 15, 870, 3361, 224, 2578, 79, 10, 138, 64, 15, 4, 2321, 128, 2579, 33, 24, 941, 1193, 15, 7, 3362, 73, 409, 118, 13, 187, 171, 709, 17, 4, 710, 199, 120, 108, 79, 2129, 322, 293, 15, 750, 98, 3, 696, 256, 107, 44, 245, 339, 2322, 12, 48, 422, 2, 652, 912, 74, 4040, 730, 130, 2, 10, 1239, 1402, 12, 39, 49, 40, 86, 227, 349, 162, 146, 141, 116, 275, 257, 2580, 377, 918, 8, 3363, 172, 414, 800, 63, 1616, 182, 1617, 11, 171, 57, 1117, 1396, 913, 233, 4041, 2323, 141, 116, 1618, 30, 13, 1392, 1118, 155, 60, 23, 69, 2, 38, 3, 9, 149, 203, 485, 152, 97, 1835, 108, 2581, 942, 75, 5, 553, 1468, 2, 465, 2931, 38, 234, 296, 155, 167, 2130, 870, 15, 199, 7, 293, 31, 1963, 15, 375, 212, 466, 482, 12, 1723, 28, 894, 129, 449, 41, 1056, 570, 226, 482, 169, 98, 1245, 187, 87, 3364, 24, 6, 643, 357, 159, 190, 2114, 3365, 1235, 1724, 397, 217, 302, 1469, 788, 537, 625, 17, 117, 2582, 2932, 1246, 276, 2, 38, 3, 994, 90, 89, 98, 410, 2, 2324, 1029, 231, 681, 540, 1081, 1030, 288, 27, 234, 2131, 385, 2, 4042, 21, 1619, 290, 1393, 47, 683, 5, 1, 159, 60, 147, 73, 80, 785]"

20,6,"Story of two princesses. The eldest, Elsa, becomes queen but she has snow powers for some reason...I guess she was born that way. So she's kind of sad about that. The younger is Anna and she's the goofy but lovably cute girl movies have told us time and again are the best kind. The two sisters argue and Elsa uses her powers in front of everybody. This freaks them out so Elsa runs away. The bulk of the plot is about Anna trying to find her sister and bring her home.Frozen is a good movie but not a great one. It's very loosely adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen."" The theme of sisterly love is nice but the movie didn't really spend a lot of time building that up. It seems like it's there at the beginning and at the end but the middle is made up of focus on other characters. Most of the movie plays out like a rehash of tried & true Disney tropes mixed with clichés from romantic comedies. There's nothing inherently wrong with that and it does work for the most part. The snowman character is the most entertaining but he seems entirely tacked on to the plot. The music is OK if a little too Broadway for my tastes. The animation is very nice. The voicework pretty good. It's not a bad movie and I'm sure kids and young women will like it even more than I did.","['story', 'two', 'princess', 'eldest', 'elsa', 'becomes', 'queen', 'snow', 'power', 'reason', 'guess', 'born', 'way', 'kind', 'sad', 'young', 'anna', 'goofy', 'lovably', 'cute', 'girl', 'movie', 'told', 'u', 'time', 'best', 'kind', 'two', 'sister', 'argue', 'elsa', 'us', 'power', 'front', 'everybody', 'freak', 'elsa', 'run', 'away', 'bulk', 'plot', 'anna', 'try', 'find', 'sister', 'bring', 'home', 'frozen', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'one', 'loosely', 'adapt', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'theme', 'sisterly', 'love', 'nice', 'movie', 'really', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'building', 'seem', 'like', 'begin', 'end', 'middle', 'make', 'focus', 'character', 'movie', 'play', 'like', 'rehash', 'try', 'true', 'disney', 'trope', 'mixed', 'clich', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'work', 'part', 'snowman', 'character', 'entertain', 'seem', 'entirely', 'tacked', 'plot', 'music', 'ok', 'little', 'broadway', 'taste', 'animation', 'nice', 'voicework', 'pretty', 'good', 'bad', 'movie', 'sure', 'kid', 'young', 'woman', 'like', 'even']","[12, 42, 29, 1838, 4, 380, 49, 39, 24, 180, 388, 589, 50, 193, 579, 73, 7, 961, 265, 76, 1, 511, 177, 20, 34, 193, 42, 15, 1247, 4, 919, 24, 938, 841, 1160, 4, 233, 101, 3367, 52, 7, 87, 71, 15, 221, 533, 5, 17, 1, 25, 10, 696, 912, 44, 245, 339, 39, 49, 226, 711, 6, 192, 1, 22, 1031, 84, 20, 920, 75, 9, 160, 41, 962, 14, 261, 8, 1, 204, 9, 4046, 87, 62, 2, 1032, 1082, 274, 393, 279, 156, 2557, 280, 107, 94, 45, 8, 243, 75, 1083, 2584, 52, 58, 477, 48, 411, 1120, 21, 192, 136, 17, 65, 1, 207, 60, 73, 251, 9, 28]"

I took two kids 5yrs old and 7 to see ""Planes"", and hearing some rather bad reviews was expecting a boring movie trying to capitalize on ""Cars"" and sat down to take a nap. It turned out I really enjoyed this movie along with the kids.Now to this ...movie...? I actually had more fun watching the coming events than this weak weak weak movie. I looked over at my wife after 5 or 10 minutes and her face told me the same thing I was feeling. I was ready to walk out after spending $50 for a terrible 3D movie and would of thought I was saving time instead of spending $50 and being punished to sit in that chair and waste another 5 minutes on this garbage.The shifting plot...singing...singing and singing for no reason ( Music is suppose to accompany plot and be almost unnoticed). This was like sitting in an opera and the music was so overwhelming that you couldn't pay attention to the weak weak weak weak plot.I also watched the kids faces...and in that time (5-10 minutes) they also weren't even looking at the screen but were more engaged in watching the other bored kids in the movie theater.I was far more proud of the kids ( 5 yrs male and 7 yr old female) for being good even though neither of them faced the screen the majority of the movie.And this movie is not a movie for all ages... it is more of a movie for no ages. It tries to be a romantic movie and tell me what 5 year old is interested in romance...or singing romance...They invented a snowman monster...for whatever reason which made no sense, because supposedly the sister Elsa banished herself because she was afraid she would hurt her sister or others from her powers...now suddenly she is sending a monster snowman to try and kill her sister and her accomplices? What .. what? The movie is full of disconnects that your brain tells your heart yo are being used and manipulated in this movie and a computerized formula was the guiding director in this piece of garbage movie.I've watched Cars 1 &2 (cars 2 not so good either) , Planes, Toy Story 1,2,3, and other kid movies a hundred times on DVD with the kids and still get some enjoyment from it because of entertaining stories that have plots that make sense.This movie...is terrible....did I mention that before...I would go over all the details but I noticed the other one star reviewers covered it pretty well.The part that amazes me is seeing that some people gave this 5 stars and also say the kids were laughing up a storm. Maybe their theater got a totally edited and rewrote script? I can't believe it would be possible for anyone to possibly give this 5 stars.Oh well difference of opinion is what makes the world go round.","['wife', 'fairly', 'young', 'grandparent', 'take', 'grand', 'kid', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'see', 'kid', 'enjoy', 'film', 'also', 'adult', 'enjoy', 'film', 'extra', 'take', 'two', 'kid', 'yr', 'old', 'see', 'plane', 'hearing', 'rather', 'bad', 'review', 'expect', 'boring', 'movie', 'try', 'capitalize', 'car', 'sat', 'take', 'nap', 'turn', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'along', 'kid', 'movie', 'actually', 'fun', 'watch', 'come', 'event', 'weak', 'weak', 'weak', 'movie', 'look', 'wife', 'minute', 'face', 'told', 'thing', 'feel', 'ready', 'walk', 'spending', 'terrible', 'movie', 'would', 'thought', 'save', 'time', 'instead', 'spending', 'punish', 'sit', 'chair', 'waste', 'another', 'minute', 'garbage', 'shift', 'plot', 'sing', 'sing', 'sing', 'reason', 'music', 'suppose', 'accompany', 'plot', 'almost', 'unnoticed', 'like', 'sit', 'opera', 'music', 'overwhelm', 'pay', 'attention', 'weak', 'weak', 'weak', 'weak', 'plot', 'also', 'watch', 'kid', 'face', 'time', 'minute', 'also', 'even', 'look', 'screen', 'engage', 'watch', 'bore', 'kid', 'movie', 'theater', 'far', 'proud', 'kid', 'yr', 'male', 'yr', 'old', 'female', 'good', 'even', 'though', 'neither', 'face', 'screen', 'majority', 'movie', 'movie', 'movie', 'age', 'movie', 'age', 'try', 'romantic', 'movie', 'tell', 'year', 'old', 'interested', 'romance', 'sing', 'romance', 'invent', 'snowman', 'monster', 'whatever', 'reason', 'make', 'sense', 'supposedly', 'sister', 'elsa', 'banish', 'afraid', 'would', 'hurt', 'sister', 'others', 'power', 'suddenly', 'send', 'monster', 'snowman', 'try', 'kill', 'sister', 'accomplice', 'movie', 'full', 'disconnect', 'brain', 'tell', 'heart', 'yo', 'use', 'manipulate', 'movie', 'computerize', 'formula', 'guide', 'director', 'piece', 'garbage', 'movie', 'watch', 'car', 'car', 'good', 'either', 'plane', 'toy', 'story', 'kid', 'movie', 'hundred', 'time', 'dvd', 'kid', 'still', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'entertain', 'story', 'plot', 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'terrible', 'mention', 'would', 'go', 'detail', 'notice', 'one', 'star', 'reviewer', 'cover', 'pretty', 'well', 'part', 'amazes', 'see', 'people', 'give', 'star', 'also', 'say', 'kid', 'laugh', 'storm', 'maybe', 'theater', 'get', 'totally', 'edit', 'rewrote', 'script', 'believe', 'would', 'possible', 'anyone', 'possibly', 'give', 'star', 'oh', 'well', 'difference', 'opinion', 'make', 'world', 'go', 'round']","[1162, 890, 73, 55, 936, 60, 1, 20, 20, 17, 1, 10, 16, 60, 91, 3, 27, 147, 91, 3, 1237, 55, 42, 60, 2133, 64, 16, 1966, 995, 191, 65, 161, 131, 370, 1, 87, 2934, 1406, 1196, 55, 113, 22, 91, 1, 172, 60, 1, 103, 125, 23, 40, 618, 434, 434, 434, 1, 66, 1162, 211, 381, 511, 43, 53, 1289, 669, 1407, 432, 1, 26, 92, 111, 20, 208, 1407, 2935, 708, 644, 102, 211, 1539, 1967, 52, 63, 63, 63, 180, 58, 473, 1472, 52, 173, 4052, 9, 708, 1473, 58, 2587, 963, 541, 434, 434, 434, 434, 52, 27, 23, 60, 381, 20, 211, 27, 28, 66, 369, 619, 23, 604, 60, 1, 312, 142, 1408, 60, 2133, 431, 2133, 64, 237, 17, 28, 100, 1197, 381, 369, 1163, 1, 1, 1, 139, 1, 139, 87, 393, 1, 143, 47, 64, 946, 363, 63, 363, 2936, 45, 495, 653, 180, 14, 217, 1290, 15, 4, 2937, 558, 26, 305, 15, 247, 24, 1033, 1968, 495, 45, 87, 286, 15, 4053, 1, 246, 4054, 1242, 143, 80, 2576, 158, 1343, 1, 3352, 534, 1727, 770, 588, 1539, 1, 23, 1406, 1406, 17, 353, 1966, 463, 12, 60, 1, 1540, 20, 540, 60, 68, 19, 1474, 243, 12, 52, 14, 217, 1, 432, 348, 26, 13, 468, 692, 10, 249, 1198, 712, 136, 18, 94, 4055, 16, 46, 57, 249, 27, 35, 60, 190, 713, 232, 312, 19, 557, 1840, 395, 220, 26, 673, 299, 842, 57, 249, 425, 18, 1164, 258, 14, 126, 13, 911]"

I'm thinking Aladdin, Beauty & The Beast, Ice Age, Finding Nemo, Brave, How To Train Your Dragon....something on that level and instead got a poorly written, super cheesy, princess Disney musical.

Keeps it from ever being a classic.I wish I could take it back.....and the clothing change to the super sexy, high slit, hip shaking, bouncing boobs, ice queen was a little disturbing. Gave it that extra malibu barbie prestige. Just what the movie needed.","['take', 'year', 'old', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'theater', 'experience', 'wish', 'could', 'take', 'back', 'saw', 'review', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'perfect', 'think', 'aladdin', 'beauty', 'beast', 'ice', 'age', 'find', 'nemo', 'brave', 'train', 'dragon', 'something', 'level', 'instead', 'get', 'poorly', 'write', 'super', 'cheesy', 'princess', 'disney', 'musical', 'expect', 'cool', 'flesh', 'fantasy', 'world', 'mystical', 'power', 'intrigue', 'story', 'instead', 'barbie', 'doll', 'princess', 'castle', 'high', 'school', 'pop', 'pile', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'none', 'song', 'remotely', 'memorable', 'language', 'felt', 'much', 'time', 'bad', 'way', 'make', 'hard', 'get', 'lose', 'fantasy', 'world', 'keep', 'ever', 'classic', 'wish', 'could', 'take', 'back', 'clothing', 'change', 'super', 'sexy', 'high', 'slit', 'hip', 'shake', 'bounce', 'boob', 'ice', 'queen', 'little', 'disturb', 'give', 'extra', 'malibu', 'barbie', 'prestige', 'movie', 'need']","[55, 47, 64, 16, 1, 36, 312, 334, 417, 54, 55, 74, 157, 161, 92, 1, 26, 175, 37, 485, 149, 203, 33, 139, 71, 1411, 335, 1124, 1412, 89, 440, 208, 19, 1125, 165, 998, 922, 29, 2, 51, 131, 556, 1620, 545, 126, 1542, 24, 1723, 12, 208, 1250, 1287, 29, 168, 206, 923, 658, 2589, 136, 714, 679, 11, 2331, 268, 2135, 155, 31, 20, 65, 50, 14, 307, 19, 489, 545, 126, 154, 81, 69, 417, 54, 55, 74, 2136, 209, 998, 2590, 206, 2942, 2943, 2591, 1969, 33, 49, 48, 2944, 57, 1237, 1250, 1, 99]"
26,1,"I really don't understand all the praise this movie has been getting. Plot holes, passable songs, casting errors, etc. make this movie one of the worst Disney movies I've ever watched in my whole life. If you like illogical movies with one-dimensional characters, you're in luck because this will be your favorite movie! That said, I have very high expectations when it comes to Disney movies, so of course, I will be more strict when giving this movie a review. If this movie had not been a Disney movie, I might have given it a 4. ""Let it Go"" is incredibly overrated. The best song, in my opinion, was either ""For the First Time in Forever"" or ""Love is an Open Door"", NOT ""Let it Go"". I watched this movie once and will never rewatch it ever again because it was so disappointing. Furthermore, Disney should have chosen someone else to voice Elsa. Idina Menzel's voice is way too mature for the young queen. The only good thing that came from this movie was that, in comparison, it made every other Disney Princess movie a million times better. In fact, I had never really been drawn to Tangled and The Princess and the Frog until I re-watched them after watching Frozen and realized that both movies (along with the Classics) are way out of Frozen's league. So I guess I can thank Frozen for making me realize how much more enjoyable older Disney movies are. This movie does not deserve all the hype it's getting, but I guess anything is possible with good advertising. Quite honestly, whoever advertised this movie should be given an award for making this mediocre movie become so popular. Without the advertising, I know that this movie would have failed horrendously. ""The Best Movie since The Lion King""? False advertising, but hey, it worked. I fell for it (unfortunately). ""From the directors of Wreck it Ralph and Tangled""? Sure, but don't even try to pretend it's anywhere as good as either one of those movies. Anyways, way to go, Disney! You've lost yet another big fan. (Judging from the other reviews, I see quite a few other Disney fans also think Disney has lost its magic.) However, I'll give you one last chance to redeem yourself with the next princess, Moana. Otherwise, it'll be your third strike (after Brave and Frozen). But until then, I will be a pre-2011 Disney Princess fan.","['really', 'understand', 'praise', 'movie', 'get', 'plot', 'hole', 'passable', 'song', 'cast', 'error', 'etc', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'bad', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'watch', 'whole', 'life', 'like', 'illogical', 'movie', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'luck', 'favorite', 'movie', 'say', 'high', 'expectation', 'come', 'disney', 'movie', 'course', 'strict', 'give', 'movie', 'review', 'movie', 'disney', 'movie', 'might', 'give', 'let', 'go', 'incredibly', 'overrate', 'best', 'song', 'opinion', 'either', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'let', 'go', 'watch', 'movie', 'never', 'rewatch', 'ever', 'disappoint', 'furthermore', 'disney', 'chosen', 'someone', 'else', 'voice', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'voice', 'way', 'mature', 'young', 'queen', 'good', 'thing', 'come', 'movie', 'comparison', 'make', 'every', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'million', 'time', 'well', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'drawn', 'tangle', 'princess', 'frog', 'watch', 'watch', 'frozen', 'realize', 'movie', 'along', 'classic', 'way', 'frozen', 'league', 'guess', 'thank', 'frozen', 'make', 'realize', 'much', 'enjoyable', 'old', 'disney', 'movie', 'movie', 'deserve', 'hype', 'get', 'guess', 'anything', 'possible', 'good', 'advertising', 'quite', 'honestly', 'whoever', 'advertised', 'movie', 'give', 'award', 'make', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'become', 'popular', 'without', 'advertising', 'know', 'movie', 'would', 'fail', 'horrendously', 'best', 'movie', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'false', 'advertising', 'hey', 'work', 'fell', 'unfortunately', 'director', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'tangle', 'sure', 'even', 'try', 'pretend', 'anywhere', 'good', 'either', 'one', 'movie', 'anyways', 'way', 'go', 'disney', 'lose', 'yet', 'another', 'big', 'fan', 'judging', 'review', 'see', 'quite', 'disney', 'fan', 'also', 'think', 'disney', 'lose', 'magic', 'however', 'give', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'redeem', 'next', 'princess', 'moana', 'otherwise', 'third', 'strike', 'brave', 'frozen', 'pre', 'disney', 'princess', 'fan']","[22, 216, 535, 1, 19, 52, 697, 4056, 11, 227, 2332, 430, 14, 1, 10, 65, 2, 1, 81, 23, 127, 79, 9, 2586, 1, 10, 751, 8, 2333, 189, 1, 35, 206, 452, 40, 2, 1, 228, 57, 1, 161, 1, 2, 1, 252, 57, 30, 13, 603, 426, 34, 11, 258, 353, 36, 20, 287, 6, 318, 478, 30, 13, 23, 1, 88, 2945, 81, 808, 2137, 2, 1841, 304, 270, 86, 4, 141, 116, 86, 50, 1022, 73, 49, 17, 43, 40, 1, 1126, 14, 115, 2, 29, 1, 965, 20, 18, 201, 88, 22, 747, 83, 29, 659, 23, 23, 5, 428, 1, 172, 69, 50, 5, 2592, 388, 1345, 5, 14, 428, 31, 306, 64, 2, 1, 1, 483, 406, 19, 388, 212, 673, 17, 2138, 124, 542, 1842, 2946, 1, 57, 469, 14, 752, 1, 179, 559, 137, 2138, 56, 1, 26, 1166, 34, 1, 98, 152, 97, 1950, 2138, 1346, 107, 843, 573, 770, 352, 379, 83, 207, 28, 87, 1970, 2139, 17, 353, 10, 1, 1292, 50, 13, 2, 489, 182, 102, 106, 176, 2593, 161, 16, 124, 2, 176, 27, 37, 2, 489, 150, 110, 57, 10, 197, 632, 1199, 418, 29, 2594, 827, 715, 1193, 335, 5, 1394, 2, 29, 176]"

It is filled with inconsistencies and the writers just pushed things along because the plot was completely weak that it couldn't stand on its own.My first complaint is that the coronation of the queen took two years. So who ran the government? The church? Other political leaders? I must assume that the other political leaders ran the kingdom while the queen sulked in her room?Then the new queen abandons her post, leaving her sister, the princess, who takes control of the kingdom by giving orders (which she wouldn't be allowed to give such orders) and then puts a visiting prince in charge??This visiting prince then starts giving orders as if he was the king and even gives a decree later putting the queen to death? WTF? Where is the bishop or the other leaders in this mess? Why aren't the guards running a blade through this jerk's chest?All this aside, the movie still sucked because Disney is in a rut.Disney has follow the path of Japanese Anime which uses these huge eyes on the main characters, of course no one else in the movie has those big sulky eyes.Then the score.The score, the lyrics suck.

34,7,"Reviewed by: Dare devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 1.5/5 starsThe worst Disney movie of all time, barring none - period. A contrived, manipulative, and trite attempt at being cute, cuddly, and melodramatic.

But off late, their recent offerings (excluding the terrific ""Wreck it Ralph"") desperately seem to be making an effort to induce us into believing that their characters are all too warm, fuzzy and want to perpetually break out into a musical jig for want of a better option.Disney's last few efforts might have just passed enough muster to be seen, forgiven, and forgotten soon after.

Now I'm one of those people who just cannot stand musicals. If you are reading this and that includes you too I urge you not to waste a penny on seeing this film. Not only is it practically back to back singing the actually storyline is just recycled Disney garbage. The heroin, the quirky character and the obligatory serious character. It's a rehashed and poorly made Shrek and not a patch on any of the Disney Pixar films like Toy Story. The adult humour you usually find in animated films these days which always appeals to me is virtually none existent and is in my mind plain and simply aimed at young children and/or musical lovers. Now I'm aware of all the critic reviews by all the big papers and magazines. A couple of snippets I saw plastered across the cover art about this being ""Disney back at its finest"" and ""The best film this year"". Who are these people that right such utter rubbish I ask myself. Were they watching the same film as me!? There is no way this is Disney at its finest and unless it's the only film I've seen in a year it most certainly isn't the best.

In conclusion, if you are unsure about this then simply wait till it's out on TV or borrow it from a friend.

I have seen Anime where the plot made more sense. Nothing is explained about WHY any of the characters would do various things - like why did those ""loving parents"" just lock the sister up in a room instead of .. you know, maybe trying to cure it or find out WHY??The dialogue was stilted and the plot totally predictable, but the songs were 3rd rate at best - reminiscent of really bad musicals from the 50's. The basic plot made no sense, none of the characters did anything that real and/or normal people would do (even in a fairy tale).

The plot had so many holes in that it resembled Swiss cheese.There have been a lot of good animated films out in the past few years, but this is not one of them. The only reason I can see for the initial very high ratings is that they were given by die hard Disney fans, who would be far more inclined to see the movie in theaters as soon as it came out.","['watch', 'ppv', 'waste', 'among', 'recent', 'animation', 'film', 'see', 'ice', 'age', 'similar', 'one', 'bad', 'totally', 'formula', 'even', 'good', 'formula', 'see', 'anime', 'plot', 'make', 'sense', 'nothing', 'explain', 'character', 'would', 'various', 'thing', 'like', 'love', 'parent', 'lock', 'sister', 'room', 'instead', 'know', 'maybe', 'try', 'cure', 'find', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'plot', 'totally', 'predictable', 'song', 'rd', 'rate', 'best', 'reminiscent', 'really', 'bad', 'musical', 'basic', 'plot', 'make', 'sense', 'none', 'character', 'anything', 'real', 'normal', 'people', 'would', 'even', 'fairy', 'tale', 'overall', 'plot', 'resemble', 'korean', 'makjang', 'rom', 'com', 'disney', 'movie', 'plot', 'many', 'hole', 'resemble', 'swiss', 'cheese', 'lot', 'good', 'animate', 'film', 'past', 'year', 'one', 'reason', 'see', 'initial', 'high', 'rating', 'give', 'die', 'hard', 'disney', 'fan', 'would', 'far', 'inclined', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'soon', 'come']","[23, 644, 471, 399, 21, 3, 16, 33, 139, 446, 10, 65, 557, 534, 28, 17, 534, 16, 2599, 52, 14, 217, 156, 400, 8, 26, 1131, 43, 9, 6, 118, 382, 15, 506, 208, 56, 232, 87, 1256, 71, 719, 52, 557, 331, 11, 2148, 694, 34, 2149, 22, 65, 51, 1088, 52, 14, 217, 679, 8, 212, 195, 873, 46, 26, 28, 219, 114, 166, 52, 2344, 4086, 3398, 968, 2, 1, 52, 61, 697, 2344, 3399, 84, 17, 38, 3, 276, 47, 10, 180, 16, 2969, 206, 437, 57, 368, 307, 2, 176, 26, 142, 2609, 16, 1, 312, 580, 40]"
44,3,"Many people have pointed out the flaws of this movie so I won't go over it again. Simply put, I fail to see how this movie comes even close to being ""the best Disney film of all time"". Best animation maybe, but that is it. A film is some where in the neighborhood of 80% story, 20% everything else. At least thats how it should be. Even low budget films with a good story are far better than this. My main concerns were glaring inconsistencies, plot holes, garbage clichés all over the place, fairly predictable, corny humor (some was clever), unexplained phenomenon, and lack luster music. The music was OK?, I guess. The voice talent was good to excellent, but I just couldn't get over the lack of substance to the lyrics. The lyrics were bland, repetitive, and at times confusing. I'll just leave it at that. Just as a side note, the sing along that was going on in my theater was really annoying. No I was not at a sing along screening, I saw this movie after it had been out for a long time so I suspect that the little girls singing along were seeing it for the 4,755th? time. I also waited for the applause at the end, but by heavens grace it didn't come. I get that this is a kid movie, so normally I wouldn't have reviewed it, or seen it (wife coerced me), but I feel the need to push back against the hysteria among adults about this movie. It baffles me. Why are adults so nuts about this puff piece? All fluff, no stuff. It had some potential but it wasted it. It could have been excellent, but instead it indulged all the old tired clichés from days gone by. Nothing new to see here folks. Except some excellent animation, if that's your thing. Which for me it is, but unfortunately that's only 20% of a movie for me. So that's why the 3 start rating. 20% for the animation, 10% for the story. I really wanted to give it 1 star to counter balance all the 10 star ratings on here, but that's just not fair.

45,5,"This was a pretty decent animated film, though nothing really exceptional.There are some good points on a conceptual level, such as the focus on multiple female heroines and to Scandinavian setting. The best aspect is that this looks astounding, with very appealing character designs and settings. The comic relief is also a mildly strong point.But this is really a quite average film. The skeleton and glitz is there, but there's not much depth and nuance (by Disney standards) that really make this film stand out among the Disney or Pixar classics. The story progression is also very patchwork where conflict is presented and resolved with a blink of an eye and ponderous diversions eat up screen time before hastily resuming the plot. When a movie like ""The Emperor's New Groove"" outdoes a film like this in all of these aspects, you know something's wrong. Even the better character development, such as Esla and Anna's relationship, doesn't seem as strong as it should.Some of these issues could be blamed on the musical aspect, a genre Disney had cornered for decades in the animation medium, taking up the script. But this film has got to have some of the weakest musical numbers in Disney's film canon. They're so generic that they could easily have been salvaged from Disney's direct-to-video ""cheapquels"". Lyrics are bland and repetitive, simply doling out exposition without being remotely memorable. At best, they are mildly diverting though still seem like lesser numbers lifted from a Disney Channel music video. It's sad when the ""Olaf in Summer"" number is the best of the bunch (sure it was completely pointless, but it was at least kinda entertaining).There's also this odd sense that this movie had serious ""in-development"" issues similar to movies like Bolt, Tangled, and Brave. While Tangle came out much better for it (and personally a better film), this one came out not so well where it seems like there wasn't much of a solid direction. While the bare bones plot survived along with a handful of well-realized character moments, Disney ended up holding this together by padding and bridging sequences with superfluous musical numbers (troll song anyone?) and plenty of fluffy comic relief moments while other seemingly important characters like Wesalton are wasted supplying little more than comic relief and expositing antagonistic dialogue here and there.I know that this was intended as a kid's/tween's movie. The themes aren't too complex beyond the importance of family, trust, and the power of love. I have no issue with that. But this one seems like it's made almost exclusively for youngsters and a product of complacency and low expectations rather than be something that older audience members can equally appreciate like the best of Disney, Pixar or even Dreamworks.","['pretty', 'decent', 'animate', 'film', 'though', 'nothing', 'really', 'exceptional', 'good', 'point', 'conceptual', 'level', 'focus', 'multiple', 'female', 'heroine', 'scandinavian', 'set', 'best', 'aspect', 'look', 'astound', 'appeal', 'character', 'design', 'setting', 'comic', 'relief', 'also', 'mildly', 'strong', 'point', 'really', 'quite', 'average', 'film', 'skeleton', 'glitz', 'much', 'depth', 'nuance', 'disney', 'standard', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'stand', 'among', 'disney', 'pixar', 'classic', 'story', 'progression', 'also', 'patchwork', 'conflict', 'present', 'resolve', 'blink', 'eye', 'ponderous', 'diversion', 'eat', 'screen', 'time', 'hastily', 'resume', 'plot', 'movie', 'like', 'emperor', 'new', 'groove', 'outdoes', 'film', 'like', 'aspect', 'know', 'something', 'wrong', 'even', 'well', 'character', 'development', 'esla', 'anna', 'relationship', 'seem', 'strong', 'issue', 'could', 'blame', 'musical', 'aspect', 'genre', 'disney', 'corner', 'decade', 'animation', 'medium', 'take', 'script', 'film', 'get', 'weak', 'musical', 'number', 'disney', 'film', 'canon', 'generic', 'could', 'easily', 'salvage', 'disney', 'direct', 'video', 'cheapquels', 'lyric', 'bland', 'repetitive', 'simply', 'doling', 'exposition', 'without', 'remotely', 'memorable', 'best', 'mildly', 'divert', 'though', 'still', 'seem', 'like', 'lesser', 'number', 'lift', 'disney', 'channel', 'music', 'video', 'sad', 'olaf', 'summer', 'number', 'best', 'bunch', 'sure', 'completely', 'pointless', 'least', 'kinda', 'entertain', 'also', 'odd', 'sense', 'movie', 'serious', 'development', 'issue', 'similar', 'movie', 'like', 'bolt', 'tangle', 'brave', 'tangle', 'come', 'much', 'well', 'personally', 'well', 'film', 'one', 'come', 'well', 'seem', 'like', 'much', 'solid', 'direction', 'bare', 'bone', 'plot', 'survive', 'along', 'handful', 'well', 'realize', 'character', 'moment', 'disney', 'end', 'hold', 'together', 'pad', 'bridging', 'sequence', 'superfluous', 'musical', 'number', 'troll', 'song', 'anyone', 'plenty', 'fluffy', 'comic', 'relief', 'moment', 'seemingly', 'important', 'character', 'like', 'wesalton', 'waste', 'supply', 'little', 'comic', 'relief', 'exposit', 'antagonistic', 'dialogue', 'know', 'intend', 'kid', 'tween', 'movie', 'theme', 'complex', 'beyond', 'importance', 'family', 'trust', 'power', 'love', 'issue', 'one', 'seem', 'like', 'make', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'youngster', 'product', 'complacency', 'low', 'expectation', 'rather', 'something', 'old', 'audience', 'member', 'equally', 'appreciate', 'like', 'best', 'disney', 'pixar', 'even', 'dreamworks']","[136, 546, 38, 3, 100, 156, 22, 1846, 17, 117, 440, 261, 1418, 237, 565, 1089, 144, 34, 443, 66, 1847, 484, 8, 424, 1629, 309, 297, 27, 1630, 167, 117, 22, 124, 921, 3, 3403, 31, 609, 2611, 2, 633, 22, 14, 3, 361, 471, 2, 194, 69, 12, 2151, 27, 552, 663, 1298, 4089, 336, 4090, 2612, 369, 20, 2304, 3404, 52, 1, 9, 2971, 108, 2346, 3, 9, 443, 56, 89, 280, 28, 18, 8, 356, 4091, 7, 153, 75, 167, 519, 54, 1631, 51, 443, 768, 2, 1983, 492, 21, 1294, 55, 395, 3, 19, 434, 51, 184, 2, 3, 1541, 969, 54, 403, 2, 721, 970, 475, 811, 1982, 341, 1739, 137, 2331, 268, 34, 1630, 100, 68, 75, 9, 4092, 184, 1848, 2, 2613, 58, 970, 579, 32, 205, 184, 34, 1211, 207, 291, 898, 250, 629, 243, 27, 1258, 217, 1, 835, 356, 519, 446, 1, 9, 1951, 83, 335, 83, 40, 31, 18, 520, 18, 3, 10, 40, 18, 75, 9, 31, 664, 754, 3405, 2614, 52, 2615, 172, 3406, 18, 428, 8, 133, 2, 41, 655, 332, 4093, 502, 2952, 51, 184, 123, 11, 299, 727, 3407, 309, 297, 133, 1161, 289, 8, 9, 644, 1984, 48, 309, 297, 4094, 719, 56, 913, 60, 2306, 1, 226, 771, 614, 1259, 72, 836, 24, 6, 519, 10, 75, 9, 14, 173, 4095, 2347, 1060, 1023, 452, 191, 89, 64, 159, 1212, 1169, 699, 9, 34, 2, 194, 28, 1035]"

50,2,"Admittedly I'm not exactly the target audience for this movie but I'm utterly mystified as to why Frozen is such a big hit. The plot is dire, full of clichés, boring and predictable. Apart from the ice palace scene, which was admittedly pretty cool, the animation is unremarkable. The endless songs are uninspired and grating. It's just so obnoxiously Disney, everything about it, the gurning animals, the sickly sentimentality, the songs, everything. For some reason the writers have gone back in time to the stuff they were putting out in the 80's and early 90s. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed films like Beauty and The Beast, Hercules, Lion King, Aladdin and so on, but that was over two decades ago. Besides, nobody else was putting out big budget animated movies anyway and we didn't have anything to compare them to. There is absolutely nothing original or groundbreaking about this movie. In an era of films like UP, Wall-E, Toy Story, this kind of output is baffling to me. Remember when Shrek came out and brilliantly mocked the fairytale, twee, sickly sentiment of Disney? It's like things have come full circle. And people seem to absolutely love it!

Frankly, it has more in common with the musical Wicked than any of those films. This is Disney's most Broadway-centric animated film. Tailor made for a Times Square marquee that, eventually, became a reality. But that's not a criticism. The music is great here. Save for the worst ear worm of 2013, there's quite a few toe-tappers that showcase the nimble lyricism of Broadway legend, Robert Lopez.

53,6,"*SPOILER ALERT*The only thing that stood out in this movie was the stunning visuals. Unfortunately, stunning visuals alone do not a good movie make. The songs were all too alike and not catchy at all in my opinion, not to mention their lack of strong vocals. I grew up watching movies like Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King with musicians such as Celine Dion and Elton John contributing to their scores. I won't be rushing out to buy the soundtrack any time soon! Another way 'Frozen' contrasts with these classics was the lack of a truly dark and evil villain. Only at the end of the film were we introduced to the antagonist and I felt he was little more than just a misguided jerk who at times could be quite likable (a charming prince). Finally, I thought that some of the adult 'humour' that was added to the movie was unnecessary and not very funny at all. I can laugh (and have laughed) along with many a children's' movie where there was no obvious attempt at adult jokes. A movie that is similar to 'Frozen' that had better music, a better villain and funnier humour is 'Tangled'.","['spoiler', 'alert', 'thing', 'stood', 'movie', 'stun', 'visuals', 'unfortunately', 'stun', 'visuals', 'alone', 'good', 'movie', 'make', 'song', 'alike', 'catchy', 'opinion', 'mention', 'lack', 'strong', 'vocal', 'grow', 'watch', 'movie', 'like', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'musician', 'celine', 'dion', 'elton', 'john', 'contribute', 'score', 'rush', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'time', 'soon', 'another', 'way', 'frozen', 'contrast', 'classic', 'lack', 'truly', 'dark', 'evil', 'villain', 'end', 'film', 'introduce', 'antagonist', 'felt', 'little', 'misguide', 'jerk', 'time', 'could', 'quite', 'likable', 'charm', 'prince', 'finally', 'thought', 'adult', 'humour', 'add', 'movie', 'unnecessary', 'funny', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'along', 'many', 'child', 'movie', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'adult', 'joke', 'movie', 'similar', 'frozen', 'well', 'music', 'well', 'villain', 'funnier', 'humour', 'tangle']","[419, 1741, 43, 1485, 1, 315, 267, 573, 315, 267, 344, 17, 1, 14, 11, 725, 266, 258, 348, 273, 167, 821, 285, 23, 1, 9, 149, 203, 152, 97, 4106, 4107, 1205, 3416, 223, 525, 948, 225, 20, 580, 102, 50, 5, 956, 69, 273, 329, 628, 277, 104, 41, 3, 736, 634, 155, 48, 3417, 2335, 20, 54, 124, 402, 235, 82, 241, 92, 147, 732, 269, 1, 845, 85, 190, 190, 172, 61, 70, 1, 595, 448, 147, 451, 1, 446, 5, 18, 58, 18, 104, 1850, 732, 83]"

57,9,"The holiday season is here once again, and I cannot think of a better way to spend it with your family then taking them to see ""Frozen,"" Disney's newest animated masterpiece. Returning to the musical renaissance style that was explored by 2010's ""Tangled,"" ""Frozen"" to tell its version of Hans Christian Anderson's classic story, ""The Snow Queen."" Despite its loose relation to the source material, Frozen still manages to be a charming, heartfelt musical event that families of all ages will enjoy. In the magical kingdom of Arendelle, a young princess named Elsa (Played by Idina Menzel of ""Glee"") possesses the power to freeze anything and conjure snow and ice with her mind. After nearly injuring her younger sister Anna (Played by Kristin Bell of ""Veronica Mars"" and ""Hit and Run"") as a child, her powers are kept a secret from the kingdom, and Anna's memories of her powers are erased to protect her. This introduction scene is short but sweet, and it really gives the audience a good sense of Elsa and Anna's relationship. Elsa is forced to shut Anna out of her life despite how much she loves her, and Anna just wants to spend more time with her sister, and can't even know why she can't for her own protection. When Elsa finally becomes old enough to be coroneted as queen, an incident at the ceremony reveals her powers to the whole kingdom. Fearing that she will be persecuted by the other kingdoms and her own people, she runs to the mountains in hiding, building herself an ice castle to spend the rest of her life in. In her despair, she brings an eternal winter upon Arendelle. In a rather progressive plot point, Anna bravely decides to venture out on her own to find Elsa and bring summer back to the kingdom. For a princess, this is quite a movement from the days of princesses waiting for their prince to save them.Anna is an extremely well developed female lead. In addition to her interesting back story and progressive nature, she is far from a flawless Mary-Sue type character. She is rather clumsy and awkward, and is willing to fall in love with a man she just met as evidenced in the song ""Love is An Open Door."" The latter trait at first comes across as cliché, but luckily, the film acknowledges the latter flaw to let her develop throughout the film.On her journey, she will meet the bulky but immensely likable Kristoph (played by Johnathan Groff of ""Glee""), a male lead that is just as clumsy as Anna. He is joined by his reindeer, Sven, an adorable character that charmingly falls into the ""All Animals Are Dogs"" trope that honestly never gets old. Also joining the troupe is a snowman Elsa and Ana made as kids named Olaf (played by Josh Gad of ""The Book of Mormon""). Many Disney films have a comic relief character that is there ""for the ride,"" however, Olaf is perhaps one of the most useful and likable comic relief characters I have ever met. Throughout the film, Olaf helps the characters on their journey and does a lot more than make jokes. He is even given a bit of depth, having his own song, ""In Summer"" that details his comically ironic curiosity for summertime. In addition to the witty, smartly written script, the musical numbers are all charming and smile-worthy. From grand-scale numbers like ""Let it Go"" to charming, character-building numbers like ""Fixer Upper,"" Frozen provides plenty of musical splendor to please the whole family. Expect a sing-a-long version to pop up soon. On top of this, the animation is stunning to say the least. From the droplets of frozen rain on the trees to the ice-built castle of Elsa, viewers will be astounded by the scenery and beauty of the world introduced to them. Frozen is a wonderful experience to add to Disney's legacy full of quality entertainment. Almost every cliché it faces can easily be brushed aside and it is certain many will adore it. There is no doubt in my mind that this film will be adored for generations.

59,8,"I am an all-the-way Disney girl. Always have, always will.QUICK COMMENT: Everything expected from Disney. Heart-melting moments, light humor, clever twists, happy ending, cheerful songs, stunning picture, etc. GO Disney! I gave this an 8/10 because of the mediocre songs and the occasional voice mismatch. (explained below)VOICE MISMATCH: In the beginning, I was captivated by Frozen. But when Elsa started to sing in the ice castle, I was rudely awakened from my dream back into reality by the mismatch of Idina's voice as Elsa. I couldn't believe my ears. I even checked on my remote control briefly to see if someone pressed anything that changed the sound setting or whatever. For the first time in my life, (after watching various Disney movies like 300 times), I couldn't bring myself to believe what I was watching. The graphics seemed separated from the soundtrack. This really breaks my heart because I am a Disney believer :'( I want everything Disney to be perfect. This is so unlike Disney.It's not just me, most people around me agrees with me. And the ones who didn't agree could see where I was coming from. Finally another person wrote this in his/her review:***"" Idina Menzel was miscast. Her speaking voice was almost acceptable, but singing-wise, it didn't suit Elsa at all.""***I think he/she sums up my only complaint very well.But please don't get me wrong. I love Idina Menzel. She is beautiful and massively talented. The problem is, I can never match Elsa with her voice. I am truly disappointed by the casting decision :'( But maybe its just me. Anyway, overall, it is still a very Disney movie.

62,8,"This film is recommended.What film could be more appropriate on a extremely cold winter night than Disney's computer animated film, Frozen. The film is loosely (very loosely) based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, The Snow Queen. In this new version, catered for today's modern audience, we meet two sisters, Anna (Kristen Bell), the good princess (what else!) and Elsa (Idina Menzel), the slightly cold but mostly misunderstood older sister (of course). Both are polar opposite in looks and personality and have that Disney cuteness going for them, but character-wise, they are distinctly different, even if the film adheres to the same crowd-pleasing conventional formula (with a few unexpected twists along the way).This plot involves the estranged relationship of two princesses. Elsa, who becomes Queen, has secret uncontrollable super powers that create endless snow and icy cold fronts that end up distancing her from her younger sibling and plaguing her kingdom. Anna sets out to rectify this problem and on her journey meets a handsome prince (there's always one per fairy tale), voiced by Santino Fontana. She befriends a handsome mountain man, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and for comic relief, his not-too-bright silent reindeer friend named Sven. We also have an even dumber sidekick, Olaf, a funny snowman who yearns to experience summer. (This character flaw leads to a wonderful musical number, In Summer, with a dream sequence that is one of the film's more successful moments.)Solidly directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, both of whom co-authored the script along with Shane Morris, Frozen has scenes that rival many Disney classics in their artistry. (Particularly memorable are an outing with trolls and the film's glorious sequence when the kingdom is trapped under a snowy mix and goes from lush greens to icy whites.) But, like other animated films of late, the film runs into script problems that prevent it from becoming a truly great children's film, with too many overly adorable interludes. Much of the dialog uses too many anachronistic phrases and modern jargon that seem totally out of sync with this tale. A few more re-writes could have taken this film to that level of excellence. ￼ Still, the animation is first-rate. The action sequences are beautifully staged and vividly detailed with lovely textures contrasting the reflective ice and powdery snow. Disturbingly, the two main female characters are such dated generic princess types with huge bug eyes and ultra-thin Barbie waists, perfect for the next new line of Disney toys but certainly not PC correct. (So much for the feminist movement!) Frozen remains a worthy visual achievement. The 3-D effects are effectively handled. The voice-over work by Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Santino Fontana and especially Josh Gad is perfection, with Alan Tudyk and Claran Hinds also providing strong support. Most of their Broadway talents come in handy with the film's strong musical score by Christophe Beck and jaunty songs by the husband-and-wife songwriting team, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. (The power ballad, Let It Go, sung by Menzel is the film's musical highlight.) ￼ Frozen is wholesome family entertainment and a fine musical treat for all ages. The film a hearty blend of stylish animation and charming story, one of Disney's best efforts in a long while. Frozen will thaw the heart of many a Grinch this holiday season and delight many moviegoers with its visual splendor. GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Back in the early 1940's, Disney wanted to produce a film about Hans Christian Anderson, incorporating his stories into a mix of live action and hand-drawn animation, with one of the fairy tale segments to include The Snow Queen. Plans for that production were shelved due to irreconcilable concept issues.","['film', 'recommend', 'film', 'could', 'appropriate', 'extremely', 'cold', 'winter', 'night', 'disney', 'computer',

The visuals are great, as per usual for a Disney film, but if you came for the visuals then congratulations, you've found a great movie. However, if you're here for good writing and characters, you can watch one of the old Disney movies like The Lion King and Emperor's New Groove, because they are LEAGUES above this utterly mediocre film. I have no idea why this movie is so INSANELY popular even to this day! IT'S 5 YEARS OLD AND THEY'RE STILL SELLING TOYS OF IT. Not to mention there's a sequel coming in 2019, and the only reason they would ever do that is because of money. It's no secret that this is the single most popular animated movie of all time and definitely the most successful in box office numbers and merchandise sales. But for something of this reputation, you'd expect the movie to be one of the greatest things ever, right? Also, screw all of these songs to hell and back. They're good on a first listen, but once you realize how over-saturated this movie is, these songs become INSANELY ANNOYING. I will never be able to listen to ''Let It Go'' ever again without almost bursting a blood vessel. The characters are also far from good, they're sloppily written, with no clear direction for where they want to be taken in and Elsa can change her outlook on everything on a bloody dime. The movie isn't funny and all attempts at humour fall flat on it's face, and good lord, don't get me started on Olaf. There are people who find Olaf charming, and people who find him aggravating, I'm the latter, $%&$ Olaf.I would say more, but with the amount of times the movie has been shoved in your face over the last five years, you probably know EVERYTHING about it.

70,10,"Life is good when you get the opportunity to escape from reality for a few hours with this new animated Disney film classic that will surely appeal to all ages and the child within us all. This is a Hans Christian Andersen story that provides the viewer with an adventure in the snowy wilderness, young love, a beautiful musical score, and a humorous tale with a funny snowman named Olaf, and a pretty smart reindeer named Sven. The heart of the story surrounds two royal sisters named Anna and Elsa who were being raised by their parents the King and Queen in a kingdom named Arendelle until they encounter a series of unfortunate circumstances. The King and Queen are lost at sea during a terrible storm, and Elsa, the older sister discovers she possesses magical powers that allow her with a simple touch to turn everything in to ice and snow. Elsa almost kills her little sister Anna by the touch of her finger when she freezes the castle and then her kingdom and loses control of her magical powers. Fearing she may harm her little sister Anna again, Elsa decides to abandon her kingdom after being crowned the new Queen and instead heads up to the highest mountains to live alone in her self made ice castle where her magical powers are out of harms way.Young Anna cannot bare to be without her big sister Elsa so she departs from her kingdom of Arendelle and she heads up in to the woods for the adventure of a lifetime. Her adventure is not without danger though as she encounters a pack of wolves, a giant and angry snow man, and a group of singing trolls. Anna receives assistance on her journey from a young handsome woodsman named Kristoff, his reindeer named Sven and a cute and adorable snowman named Olaf. So on they go through the woods seeking out Anna's big sister Elsa to bring her home to the castle they both grew up in and played together in until that fatal accident that scared Elsa from playing with her little sister Anna, ever again.Frozen will keep you in your seat until the very end and we soon find out that true love can conquer all fears and all dangers. You may even find yourself holding back a few tears if you have any siblings that you shamelessly quarrelled with. I am not a fan of three (3D) dimensional feature films as I personally feel that the special effects actually take away from the magic of this wonderful Disney film. Call me old fashioned but the 3D effects I find more a distraction in Frozen. If I had been provided an option, I would have preferred to see the non 3D version. Having said that, I will however suggest that you get to the theater early so that you don't miss the very smartly done short cartoon that preceded Frozen. This Mickey Mouse short cartoon melds both an original 1930's black and white Mickey Mouse cartoon with a current 3D Mickey Mouse cartoon. The animators took the original 1930's Mickey Mouse cartoon and weaved in and out of the original black and white cartoon in to their 3D colorful characters during the chase scenes. It was quite a unique feat, but only when done in a short cartoon, not as effective in the feature film, Frozen.I rated Frozen a perfect 10 out of 10. You and all of your family will just love it. The musical score is also one of the most popular cinema musical scores produced of all time and is sung by young children all over the world.","['life', 'good', 'get', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'reality', 'hour', 'new', 'animate', 'disney', 'film', 'classic', 'surely', 'appeal', 'age', 'child', 'within', 'u', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'story', 'provide', 'viewer', 'adventure', 'snowy', 'wilderness', 'young', 'love', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'humorous', 'tale', 'funny', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'pretty', 'smart', 'reindeer', 'name', 'sven', 'heart', 'story', 'surround', 'two', 'royal', 'sister', 'name', 'anna', 'elsa', 'raise', 'parent', 'king', 'queen', 'kingdom', 'name', 'arendelle', 'encounter', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'circumstance', 'king', 'queen', 'lose', 'sea', 'terrible', 'storm', 'elsa', 'old', 'sister', 'discovers', 'posse', 'magical', 'power', 'allow', 'simple', 'touch', 'turn', 'everything', 'ice', 'snow', 'elsa', 'almost', 'kill', 'little', 'sister', 'anna', 'touch', 'finger', 'freeze', 'castle', 'kingdom', 'loses', 'control', 'magical', 'power', 'fear', 'may', 'harm', 'little', 'sister', 'anna', 'elsa', 'decides', 'abandon', 'kingdom', 'crown', 'new', 'queen', 'instead', 'head', 'high', 'mountain', 'live', 'alone', 'self', 'make', 'ice', 'castle', 'magical', 'power', 'harm', 'way', 'young', 'anna', 'bare', 'without', 'big', 'sister', 'elsa', 'departs', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'head', 'wood', 'adventure', 'lifetime', 'adventure', 'without', 'danger', 'though', 'encounter', 'pack', 'wolf', 'giant', 'angry', 'snow', 'man', 'group', 'sing', 'troll', 'anna', 'receives', 'assistance', 'journey', 'young', 'handsome', 'woodsman', 'name', 'kristoff', 'reindeer', 'name', 'sven', 'cute', 'adorable', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'go', 'wood', 'seek', 'anna', 'big', 'sister', 'elsa', 'bring', 'home', 'castle', 'grow', 'played', 'together', 'fatal', 'accident', 'scar', 'elsa', 'play', 'little', 'sister', 'anna', 'ever', 'frozen', 'keep', 'seat', 'end', 'soon', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'conquer', 'fear', 'danger', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'hold', 'back', 'tear', 'sibling', 'shamelessly', 'quarrel', 'fan', 'three', 'dimensional', 'feature', 'film', 'personally', 'feel', 'special', 'effect', 'actually', 'take', 'away', 'magic', 'wonderful', 'disney', 'film', 'call', 'old', 'fashion', 'effect', 'find', 'distraction', 'frozen', 'provide', 'option', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'non', 'version', 'say', 'however', 'suggest', 'get', 'theater', 'early', 'miss', 'smartly', 'short', 'cartoon', 'precede', 'frozen', 'mickey', 'mouse', 'short', 'cartoon', 'meld', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'mickey', 'mouse', 'cartoon', 'current', 'mickey', 'mouse', 'cartoon', 'animator', 'take', 'original', 'mickey', 'mouse', 'cartoon', 'weave', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'cartoon', 'colorful', 'character', 'chase', 'scene', 'quite', 'unique', 'feat', 'short', 'cartoon', 'effective', 'feature', 'film', 'frozen', 'rat', 'frozen', 'perfect', 'family', 'love', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'one', 'popular', 'cinema', 'musical', 'score', 'produce', 'time', 'sung', 'young', 'child', 'world']","[79, 17, 19, 759, 950, 940, 487, 108, 38, 2, 3, 69, 960, 484, 139, 70, 654, 177, 44, 245, 339, 12, 458, 479, 326, 1218, 1752, 73, 6, 93, 51, 223, 1135, 114, 85, 45, 183, 32, 136, 1001, 151, 183, 181, 80, 12, 1353, 42, 870, 15, 183, 7, 4, 760, 118, 97, 49, 77, 183, 199, 951, 791, 1555, 2996, 97, 49, 489, 1002, 432, 713, 4, 64, 15, 1859, 1215, 170, 24, 833, 516, 260, 113, 132, 33, 39, 4, 173, 286, 48, 15, 7, 260, 1745, 282, 168, 77, 1410, 128, 170, 24, 187, 171, 709, 48, 15, 7, 4, 996, 1622, 77, 722, 108, 49, 208, 317, 206, 214, 224, 344, 429, 14, 33, 168, 170, 24, 709, 50, 73, 7, 3405, 137, 106, 15, 4, 77, 199, 317, 1296, 326, 2324, 326, 137, 901, 100, 951, 2161, 2002, 1171, 2162, 39, 145, 849, 63, 123, 7, 2997, 3439, 337, 73, 739, 2998, 183, 67, 151, 183, 181, 265, 687, 45, 183, 32, 13, 1296, 997, 7, 106, 15, 4, 221, 533, 168, 285, 507, 332, 2163, 480, 878, 4, 204, 48, 15, 7, 81, 5, 154, 966, 41, 580, 71, 62, 6, 4132, 187, 901, 171, 28, 71, 655, 74, 748, 409, 176, 433, 751, 229, 3, 520, 53, 316, 278, 103, 55, 101, 150, 215, 2, 3, 308, 64, 974, 278, 71, 1860, 5, 458, 1974, 26, 957, 16, 1085, 435, 35, 110, 1049, 19, 312, 594, 271, 2627, 263, 314, 2360, 5, 850, 707, 263, 314, 230, 1172, 365, 850, 707, 314, 1481, 850, 707, 314, 812, 55, 230, 850, 707, 314, 3440, 230, 1172, 365, 314, 1427, 8, 2003, 90, 124, 414, 2307, 263, 314, 1363, 229, 3, 5, 1055, 5, 175, 72, 6, 51, 223, 27, 10, 559, 543, 51, 223, 587, 20, 684, 73, 70, 126]"

73,9,"For those who rate this movie below a 7. That is not correct, sure opinions are opinions, but that doesn't mean this movie is the worst in the Disney line-up. In fact it is one of Disney's best in years. The story while lacks in some areas, works well in its favor and follows well with the characters we get to know. The characters are very memorable, from the quirky Anna who never gives up on Elsa, to Olaf who was created from the good side of Elsa who only a wants to be with her sister. The songs are one of Disneys, best returning to that classic form we all know and love from the reinassance and golden ages. Is it the best? No, I grew up with the Reinassance from the Little Mermaid to Tarzan and can say Frozen stands alongside the classics. The animation is one of the best Disney has ever done that will still be good years from now to look back on. The only minor flaws to the movie is the transitions into the songs, the ""villain"" of the movie, and the setup for the ending. Overall, the movie does not deserve the hate is getting and deserves the praise. This is the something that happened to the Lion King back in 94, except the internet didn't exist so it wasn't that big of a deal. If you haven't see the movie yet, I and many other Disney fans can recommend this film. Don't listen to the 1-5/10 ratings on here there more than likely either jealous, on the hate wagon, or just forgot what makes a Disney movie great.

Instead this is a female centric story focusing on sisterhood, aimed at a female demographic with unnecessarily long songs.Instead of having a story focused upon on the ice queen or her sister, they try and do both. It fails especially because the sister, Anna, is a lonely young girl yet is well adjusted and unrealistically happy in her situation. Her clumsiness and the ridiculous timing of Prince Hans' interactions with her is exactly what we'd find in a romantic comedy; i.e. a clichéd silly, clumsy girl being lovestruck with the perfect gentleman.To top this off in the first 20 mins we have to endure 3 long songs, 3!

77,1,"I think it's safe to say that Frozen has steadily become an excellent example of a love-it-or-hate-it movie. Many people worship it as though its existence will lead to world peace, while others, like me, love to tear it to shreds. At first I was reluctant to watch the film despite finding out about the world's adoration for it, but after my Mum bought the DVD, I decided to give it a go. My family and I sat down one day after Easter Sunday to watch the film – and honestly, I've never been more disappointed in my life. I didn't just dislike Frozen. I outright hated it. It didn't delight or move me in any way.There were so many reasons to dislike Frozen that at the time, I couldn't keep count of them. Watching it, I was so flabbergasted at the sheer ineptitude of it that I eventually gave up hope that it would improve and just sat there, knowing that at some point I'd be writing this review. Granted, I found one, maybe two things that are good about the film – but the negative aspects of the film absolutely demolish the positives here. It fails in almost every department. The story is weak. The characters are one-dimensional. The settings are bland. The pacing is awful. The film doesn't open with a bang, but with a boring musical number that serves no purpose; this is followed up by perhaps the most depressing first few scenes in the history of animation, and the film goes downhill from there. Any scenes of action are tacked on. The troll scene is an abomination. The adventure is clichéd and never truly takes off. The supporting characters are useless and unfunny. The dialogue is forgettable. The climax is predictable. There's hardly any sense of joy because it takes itself too seriously. No scenes really stand out because of how rushed everything is, and loads of questions are left unanswered.However, in my honest opinion, the film's most grievous hindrance of all is the main character, Elsa. She is so thoroughly unlikable that if I were to make a list of my most hated film characters, she'd easily rank somewhere in the top five. Elsa is a smug, entitled, bitter hypocrite, no better a role model for little girls than Taylor Swift. She believes throughout most of the movie that it's better to hate yourself than have any human interaction, making Anna's childhood miserable in the process and showing little to no shame for it. She then claims through her infuriatingly overplayed song that her ability to ""let it go"" suddenly places her on a pedestal above everyone else; thus, she's now able to love who she is, but then proceeds to do absolutely nothing to actually improve herself until the plot forces her to like a selfish wimp. She's a useless, cowardly, self-important whiner, and it's this aspect, along with the movie's convoluted snoozefest of a plot and mediocre supporting characters, that makes the movie fall flat.In my honest opinion, despite all of the praise it has received and the money it has made, ""Frozen"" is a catastrophic failure and easily the most disappointing animated films I have ever watched. My expectations were massive and weren't met at all. Not counting the pretty decent computer animation – the sole thing about the film that's actually good – It doesn't get anything right (though it still manages to entertain undemanding, princess-obsessed little girls, so there's another positive). It's so broken in so many ways that it's beyond repair; that is, unless one was to re-write the entire thing from scratch. What should have been a magical, optimistic winter fantasia full of lively, comedic adventure and heart is actually a miserable, pretentious, aimless bore, and in my honest opinion, the most overrated movie in the history of cinema.","['think', 'safe', 'say', 'frozen', 'steadily', 'become', 'excellent', 'example', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'many', 'people', 'worship', 'though', 'existence', 'lead', 'world', 'peace', 'others', 'like', 'love', 'tear', 'shred', 'first', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'film', 'despite', 'find', 'world', 'adoration', 'mum', 'bought', 'dvd', 'decide', 'give', 'go', 'family', 'sat', 'one', 'day', 'easter', 'sunday', 'watch', 'film', 'honestly', 'never', 'disappointed', 'life', 'dislike', 'frozen', 'outright', 'hat', 'delight', 'move', 'way', 'many', 'reason', 'dislike', 'frozen', 'time', 'keep', 'count', 'watch', 'flabbergast', 'sheer', 'ineptitude', 'eventually', 'give', 'hope', 'would', 'improve', 'sat', 'know', 'point', 'write', 'review', 'grant', 'found', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'thing', 'good', 'film', 'negative', 'aspect', 'film', 'absolutely', 'demolish', 'positive', 'fails', 'almost', 'every', 'department', 'story', 'weak', 'character', 'one', 'dimensional', 'setting', 'bland', 'pace', 'awful', 'film', 'open', 'bang', 'boring', 'musical', 'number', 'serf', 'purpose', 'follow', 'perhaps', 'depress', 'first', 'scene', 'history', 'animation', 'film', 'go', 'downhill', 'scene', 'action', 'tacked', 'troll', 'scene', 'abomination', 'adventure', 'clich', 'never', 'truly', 'take', 'support', 'character', 'useless', 'unfunny', 'dialogue', 'forgettable', 'climax', 'predictable', 'hardly', 'sense', 'joy', 'take', 'seriously', 'scene', 'really', 'stand', 'rush', 'everything', 'load', 'question', 'left', 'unanswered', 'however', 'honest', 'opinion', 'film', 'grievous', 'hindrance', 'main', 'character', 'elsa', 'thoroughly', 'unlikable', 'make', 'list', 'hat', 'film', 'character', 'easily', 'rank', 'somewhere', 'top', 'five', 'elsa', 'smug', 'entitle', 'bitter', 'hypocrite', 'well', 'role', 'model', 'little', 'girl', 'taylor', 'swift', 'believe', 'throughout', 'movie', 'well', 'hate', 'human', 'interaction', 'make', 'anna', 'childhood', 'miserable', 'process', 'show', 'little', 'shame', 'claim', 'infuriatingly', 'overplayed', 'song', 'ability', 'let', 'go', 'suddenly', 'place', 'pedestal', 'everyone', 'else', 'thus', 'able', 'love', 'proceeds', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'actually', 'improve', 'plot', 'force', 'like', 'selfish', 'wimp', 'useless', 'cowardly', 'self', 'important', 'whiner', 'aspect', 'along', 'movie', 'convolute', 'snoozefest', 'plot', 'mediocre', 'support', 'character', 'make', 'movie', 'fall', 'flat', 'honest', 'opinion', 'despite', 'praise', 'receive', 'money', 'make', 'frozen', 'catastrophic', 'failure', 'easily', 'disappoint', 'animate', 'film', 'ever', 'watch', 'expectation', 'massive', 'met', 'counting', 'pretty', 'decent', 'computer', 'animation', 'sole', 'thing', 'film', 'actually', 'good', 'get', 'anything', 'right', 'though', 'still', 'manages', 'entertain', 'undemanding', 'princess', 'obsess', 'little', 'girl', 'another', 'positive', 'broken', 'many', 'way', 'beyond', 'repair', 'unless', 'one', 'write', 'entire', 'thing', 'scratch', 'magical', 'optimistic', 'winter', 'fantasia', 'full', 'lively', 'comedic', 'adventure', 'heart', 'actually', 'miserable', 'pretentious', 'aimless', 'bore', 'honest', 'opinion', 'overrate', 'movie', 'history', 'cinema']","[37, 1174, 35, 5, 179, 298, 396, 6, 333, 1, 61, 46, 100, 1429, 248, 126, 1976, 247, 9, 6, 748, 4139, 36, 2164, 23, 3, 313, 71, 126, 4140, 2362, 1863, 540, 491, 57, 13, 72, 1196, 10, 138, 2582, 2363, 23, 3, 542, 88, 476, 79, 1116, 5, 3002, 606, 1062, 242, 50, 61, 180, 1116, 5, 20, 154, 1430, 23, 2007, 652, 57, 384, 26, 1864, 1196, 56, 117, 165, 161, 1865, 231, 10, 232, 42, 43, 17, 3, 761, 443, 3, 292, 503, 1052, 173, 115, 1755, 12, 434, 8, 10, 751, 1629, 811, 564, 874, 3, 318, 4141, 370, 51, 184, 1866, 646, 378, 578, 2364, 36, 90, 636, 21, 3, 13, 3003, 90, 345, 2584, 123, 90, 2638, 326, 274, 88, 329, 55, 740, 8, 1490, 2639, 719, 660, 792, 331, 976, 217, 738, 55, 667, 90, 22, 361, 525, 132, 2315, 824, 330, 2365, 110, 742, 258, 3, 4142, 119, 8, 4, 1243, 4143, 14, 550, 606, 3, 8, 403, 1468, 1867, 239, 731, 4, 1868, 4144, 18, 371, 753, 48, 76, 3443, 2917, 220, 296, 1, 18, 333, 515, 1064, 14, 7, 466, 3004, 1097, 78, 48, 1403, 1042, 1962, 11, 367, 30, 13, 1033, 188, 109, 270, 1348, 294, 6, 3005, 292, 156, 103, 1864, 52, 272, 9, 1558, 4145, 1490, 3444, 429, 289, 443, 172, 1, 3445, 52, 752, 740, 8, 14, 1, 186, 838, 742, 258, 313, 535, 852, 661, 14, 5, 1623, 403, 808, 38, 3, 81, 23, 452, 1219, 392, 2640, 136, 546, 642, 21, 3006, 43, 3, 103, 17, 19, 212, 130, 100, 68, 825, 243, 29, 1244, 48, 76, 102, 503, 1245, 61, 50, 614, 4146, 959, 10, 165, 264, 43, 3446, 170, 1268, 105, 3447, 246, 1559, 1043, 326, 80, 103, 3004, 3357, 4147, 604, 742, 258, 426, 1, 636, 543]"

While my son was growing up we saw and then purchased each movie (video cassette) with the exception of Pocahontas because I object to using a historical character and changing the tale. Then we repeated with DVD purchases and CDs, watching and rewatching even as he left his teens. Frozen I will never own and don't believe I will ever watch again. Borrowed this DVD from the library. I do not understand at all how the hype got started and kept spreading even after people actually saw the movie. There is no interesting story to tell. The characters are not lovable in the Disney way. I'm a musical fan and own many Disney movie song CDs (started with cassette tapes) that I still listen to quite frequently. This movie had so many songs that the story couldn't flow smoothly. Songs did not further the story-telling in any way. Even the big hit, Let it Go, does not send a message for the movie fans to relive. How many of us have been caught with frozen magical powers?

79,6,"At the core of ""Frozen"" are lessons on responsibility and how power requires both a calm head and tremendous care. It is also the perfect film for two young sisters to sit down and absorb together, and not just because kids will like the bouncy songs and the funny snowman, but because its central relationship is between two sisters. This is, as far as I'm aware, quite rare - lots of Disney films have of course depicted the tales of princesses, but central to this particular effort is the friendship between two children (eventually young women) who share a blood kinship. The film is designed, it would therefore seem, to impart the message that things do not always go according to plan in families (nor in love), but that they are ultimately worth sticking at.""Frozen"" begins in the setting of Arendelle, a fictitious and seemingly Scandinavian kingdom set what appears to be many centuries ago - it depicts Elsa (Kristen Bell) and Anna (Idina Menzel), who are daughters to a royal family and they live in a palace. For reasons unexplained, young Elsa possesses the very X-Men-like magical ability to turn anything into a wintry, snowy object. This leads to the rendering of playtime with her younger sister Anna a little more exciting than it might ordinarily be, with snowball fights and large slippery ice flumes around the huge interior rooms they occupy being the order of the day. Elsa is heir to the crown, but is considered too dangerous to be around her sister for fate of nearly killing her with her abilities. As a consequence, the girls are segregated against their will until both are old enough to identify with a degree of maturity. By the time this arrives, their parents are dead and Elsa is due to inherit the throne. The years spent apart have forged the girls into two binaries where previously they were one-and-alike, foreshadowing the divide in the family which initiates the film's main body. Anna can barely contain her excitement, for the reason that she is on the cusp of being able to interact with other people at the ceremony and potentially even find a spouse. Elsa, on the other hand, is terrified of being let loose on the world - she isn't fully in control of her emotions. She came close to killing somebody once, and she may accidentally do it again...Something resembling this isn't too far from what unfolds, forcing a berserk Elsa off and away into the wilderness and Arendelle to resemble Narnia. The bulk of the film then comes to form Anna's trek to find rediscover her sibling and try to put things right, while a plot back home is hatched by an unscrupulous Duke who sees his chance to come into possession of the kingdom amidst what I can only describe as a constitutional crisis. En route, she meets an ice-trader named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), who possesses the wisdom to see that Anna's falling in love with someone at first sight back at the coronation is silly, yet entrusts that reindeers make for better accomplices than people...The film is by no means a failure, but has a hard time balancing the two sisters as duel-protagonists and suffers as a consequence - there is a healthy degree of ambition in what directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck attempt, but it all too often feels like a bit of a weekend cartoon in need of some reigning in. To whom ""Frozen"" belongs remains a constant source of ambiguity - it is at once Anna's love story and yet it is Elsa's journey of self-discovery; both characters learn to control their emotions, but are not the primary focus for long enough for most of us to really ease ourselves into their respective stories, all of which leads me to the conclusion that the film is best viewed by young siblings (preferably sisters) who will be able to take something from either strand based on who is the eldest in that family.Certainly, the film looks good - the wintry setting has been brought to life wonderfully well and is certainly able to take its place alongside the likes of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Finding Nemo"" as an accomplishment of special effects whereby you are plunged into a world entirely different to our own. If I were to accuse the film of needing the character of Olaf (Josh Gad) to provide it with a bit of energy - even to keep it amusing - I imagine few would argue. If lacking in this magical, wise-cracking snowman, whom Anna meets along her way to confront Elsa, the film is not even necessarily funny, and takes on an entirely different complexion. Its songs, whilst on the receiving end of much praise, struck me as somewhat ordinary and too recurrent. Perhaps it is because I am not the target audience for the film that I could not take to it to any tremendous degree, but I do not consider myself shut off from animated films nor Disney's output generally - I left ""Frozen"" a little cold, and far from feeling the enthusiasm I have done for their past projects.","['core', 'frozen', 'lesson', 'responsibility', 'power', 'require', 'calm',

80,10,"Frozen brings me back to Disney's renaissance. I haven't felt so immerse and loved a Disney (not Pixar) movie since a long long time. It makes me wish the characters were real, makes me want a sequel (and that's saying A LOT considering Disney's history with sequels). As I said before, it brings me back to the good old Disney days, but it's also a big step forward, why? Because Frozen breaks the traditional clichés and things that were characteristic from the old movies (doesn't mean they're bad, it just that we're not in the damsel in distress' era). I don't want to spoil a single thing about the movie, if you haven't seen it, DO IT. It's a must watch, and it's not a kids picture, but a family one. It has received a lot of hate nowadays, after thinking about it and looking at some comments I understood it. The hate comes in a great part because of the movie's popularity, everywhere you go you see Frozen. After some time you star thinking ""ha, why is this movie so popular? It's not that good, no, I hate it, everything about it is bad, it's not the new Lion King"" etc. So they start overanalazing the movie and try to find every flaw it can have, almost every complaint it's about plot holes (when actually, you can understand almost everything if you use logic). In summary, Frozen is a very good movie, worth watching and a big step for Disney.","['frozen', 'brings', 'back', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'felt', 'immerse', 'love', 'disney', 'pixar', 'movie', 'since', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'make', 'wish', 'character', 'real', 'make', 'want', 'sequel', 'say', 'lot', 'consider', 'disney', 'history', 'sequel', 'say', 'brings', 'back', 'good', 'old', 'disney', 'day', 'also', 'big', 'step', 'forward', 'frozen', 'break', 'traditional', 'clich', 'thing', 'characteristic', 'old', 'movie', 'mean', 'bad', 'damsel', 'distress', 'era', 'want', 'spoil', 'single', 'thing', 'movie', 'see', 'must', 'watch', 'kid', 'picture', 'family', 'one', 'receive', 'lot', 'hate', 'nowadays', 'think', 'look', 'comment', 'understood', 'hate', 'come', 'great', 'part', 'movie', 'popularity', 'everywhere', 'go', 'see', 'frozen', 'time', 'star', 'think', 'ha', 'movie', 'popular', 'good', 'hate', 'everything', 'bad', 'new', 'lion', 'king', 'etc', 'start', 'overanalazing', 'movie', 'try', 'find', 'every', 'flaw', 'almost', 'every', 'complaint', 'plot', 'hole', 'actually', 'understand', 'almost', 'everything', 'use', 'logic', 'summary', 'frozen', 'good', 'movie', 'worth', 'watch', 'big', 'step', 'disney']","[5, 509, 74, 2, 465, 155, 3014, 6, 2, 194, 1, 98, 169, 169, 20, 14, 417, 8, 195, 14, 59, 561, 35, 84, 421, 2, 636, 561, 35, 509, 74, 17, 64, 2, 138, 27, 106, 668, 571, 5, 340, 462, 274, 43, 2374, 64, 1, 218, 65, 1492, 1563, 942, 59, 1056, 741, 43, 1, 16, 236, 23, 60, 438, 72, 10, 852, 84, 333, 1475, 37, 66, 916, 2167, 333, 40, 25, 94, 1, 1872, 879, 13, 16, 5, 20, 249, 37, 2168, 1, 559, 17, 333, 132, 65, 108, 152, 97, 430, 120, 1, 87, 71, 115, 386, 173, 115, 897, 52, 697, 103, 216, 173, 132, 158, 1464, 1432, 5, 17, 1, 254, 23, 106, 668, 2]"
81,9,"Disney seem to have been doing rather well in the past few years. It's first renaissance (beginning with The Little Mermaid in '89) ended abruptly in the late 90s and was replaced with the meteoric rise of Pixar, which could seemingly do no wrong, releasing hit after hit. Even Dreamworks was more consistent! But 2010 marked Pixar's peak (Toy Story 3) and Disney's return. Tangled was an excellent return to form, and Wreck-it Ralph was great fun. But it is with Frozen that Disney has captured the magic once again, in a wonderful movie deserving of its massive success.Frozen is a beautiful film where nothing really goes wrong. The music is Disney at its catchiest, the visuals are picturesque, and the characters are irresistibly charming. Loosely based on the Snow Queen, Frozen focuses on two sisters, Elsa and Anna, dealing with Elsa's cold-based magic and its consequences, both physical and mental. Elsa regresses and becomes a recluse while Anna becomes overly hopeful. While it doesn't discuss the psychological issues too deeply, the subtext and emotions are there for pondering.Along the way the two sisters meet other colourful characters, primarily Kristoff, an ice trader, and Josh Gad's adorably hilarious snowman Olaf, the best sidekick since the Genie of Aladdin. His pleasant naivety is heartwarming, to say the least. The film has been much lauded for its 'progressive' elements, notably that its main relationship is not romantic, but between the two sisters, and other subversions of genre that to state would spoil the plot.Though with regards to plot, that may be the weakest part. Frozen went through numerous rewrites along a complicated development process, and it can be seen in the final product. Characters and traits are set up early on that are forgotten or abandoned in the second half- for instance Kristoff is established in the film's first scene as an ice trader whose love in life is ice, yet there is never any kind of reference to this in the proximity of Elsa, who has limitless magical control of ice. Nefarious looking characters never really amount to much, and possibly one too many red herrings are used seemingly solely for the purpose of pulling the rug out from under the audience. And while none can doubt the brilliance of Let it Go, the Elsa at the end of the song is not the same as the Elsa in her next scene. Also, rock trolls.Yet, this is to complain about minor qualms. The plot works, pleasantly surprises, and is ultimately a backseat to the characters. There have been many plot comparisons to The Lion King (which are well-founded), but the plot in Lion King drove the narrative, whereas in Frozen the characters are the drivers, first and foremost. An equally compelling comparison is to Tangled, except the traits of the single Female protagonist are divided between the two sisters here.It would be boring to simply state the wonders of the art style and the charm, so one could be somewhat picky. Frozen's soundtrack is great, but has the same problem that a few Disney films suffer from, namely that one great song overshadows both the other songs and the rest of the film itself- the best example being Mulan and 'I'll make a man out of you'. 'Let it Go' is this to a T. Yet it's entirely forgivable, not just for being a great track, but also for being the best looking piece in the film, creating the gorgeous ice palace before the audience's eyes.Frozen confirms that Disney have returned to form- hopefully something that continues. It's fantastic fun, appeals to all ages, both genders, while being positively progressive in ways that blockbusters seldom are- not just animation or kids films. Disney are still determined to focus on over-privileged Royalty at the expense of commoners, but otherwise Disney are moving full steam ahead. A magical success.","['disney', 'seem', 'rather', 'well', 'past', 'year', 'first', 'renaissance', 'begin', 'little', 'mermaid', 'end', 'abruptly', 'late', 'replace', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'pixar',

82,10,"I'll admit I do have a place in my heart for the Disney fantasy films, from childhood to adulthood most of them are timeless to me because they had heart. This is another film whose heart is in the right place.I really love the animation, it's CGI animation at it's finest once again and used the right way. From the character animation, background which capture a swiss Bavarian setting, however what impresses me the most is the ice power effects which are just beautiful. It is just awesome to see Elsa use her powers; my favorite sequence from that is seeing the construction of the Ice Palace.The songs are hit or miss, but that's true with a lot of musicals. But to me the two songs that stick out are ""For the First Time in Forever"" and my favorite and no surprise ""Let it Go"" which is just a beautiful song about just doing what you feel and being yourself.I really like the story in a strange way this fantasy story is also almost like a ""X-Men"" tale (if you read the comic series or seen the live action films you know what I'm talking about). But that it's simply a great love story, not so much just between both a guy and and girl which we have, but between siblings.I really like the main character Elisa (voiced well by Idina Menzel). The depth to her character is pretty tragic and you really feel a sense of pathos for her. She's sort of like one of the mutants in the ""X-Men"" comic book series. Like the mutants she's born with a special ability, though here it's deemed as magic. Though the main dilemma is she doesn't know how to fully control them nor does she entirely understand them.The poor girl is pretty much forced to being a control freak, she has to constantly keep her powers and emotions in check even from doing the simplest things like keeping a mere pencil from becoming an icicle from picking it up. Or even just touching people as we see her wearing gloves throughout the first half of the film, much like with ""Rogue"" on ""X-Men"". One scene that I'll admit is a bit heartbreaking is whenever Anna has always knocked on Elisa's door and asks for her to play but she never comes out. But you can tell from the emotion on her face she really wants to come out but can't because she's afraid she'll harm her again with her powers, despite the fact she already is hurting her; it's just awful it's no way to live.The other character I like and is my favorite is Anna (voiced well by underrated actress Kristen Bell). She is just great, she's beautiful both inside and out. She funny, she has great charisma that is just crackling like fireworks, she has some of the best lines in the film highly energetic and fast moving, and feisty which is a trait I love best. However what make it great is the back and forth between them which I think is beautiful, it's a great sibling relationship even like that one little moment when both of them say ""Choclate"" at the same time which was sweet and kinda funny. This good relationship is all the more reason why I want both of them to win because it can be forever if they want it. For Anna it's to somehow get though to Elsa somehow. I love the fact that Anna accepts and loves Elsa for who she is regardless of the fact she has powers, and is doing everything in her power to help her, which to me is part of what love truly is.And personally I felt that's why Elsa powers were getting out of control the powers are connected with her emotions, it was because she wasn't allowing herself to feel things and have or experience certain things in her life. When that happens it usual would bring negative feelings to yourself and a not so positive outlook on life, and her powers are making things bad because she feels bad. It just shows why it good to feel things. As Doctor Number 5 in ""Doctor Who"" once said ""Emotions also enhance life."" Even like the two supporting characters: Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad) is surprising a fun, funny, even charming character. Olaf's persona sort of reminds me of Frosty from the Ralkin and Bass ""Frosty the Snowman"" Christmas special which is great because this character isn't all laughs but does have heart, just like Frosty he's someone you want to be friends with. But I like that the guy has a dream which is to be in the sun, which is of course impossible but it's easy to emphasize with, we have those kinds of dreams of attaining the unattainable.But the one I like the most is Kristoff. Kristoff isn't a stereotypical pretty boy protagonist, I love the fact he's kinda a underdog, he's pretty much a blue collar worker, doesn't have all the breaks, he doesn't get the girls, he's not too smooth, but he has a good heart, big dreams, and isn't afraid to help or step up when he should. Love the back and forth between both Anna and Kris, which I think is a very good chemistry, the banter between them is fun, funny and warm you already know from this chemistry that both are right for each other which is all the more reason why I want this guy to win; we want Anna with a guy we she knows best.If the film has a message, it's simply about being yourself and not being afraid of what you feel, embrace and express your emotion. But also just simply what true love really is.This film will melt and warm your heart.Rating: 4 stars","['admit', 'place', 'heart', 'disney', 'fantasy', 'film', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'timeless',

83,7,Okay so from the previews I also came to this realization and that's why I did not go see it in the movie theaters. And maybe this would have taken away from the movie but here's what I think should have happened. I really wanted to see both of the sisters end up with someone or be left with the idea of someone at least for Elsa. Now I know that's cheesy but they could have had the prince stay good for the entire movie and then either have him stay with Anna or go with Elsa although I do think Kristoff would have been a better match for Elsa at some moments. They could have made the focus and message still that love will unfreeze the coldest heart. Also with how much Elsa had to give up by staying away from her sister and then losing her parents I really think she out of both of them could have used a love interest. Maybe I'm just sappy but that is why I won't purchase this movie.

Maybe this is because I saw Free Birds the weekend before with my kids, and that was funny and entertaining, the kids loved Free Birds, so I went to Frozen thinking Disney can do better. My kids were bored, I was bored, and I wished I had gone and seen Free Birds again (actually no I don't because I like new stuff), but anything would have been better then this flick. I would save your money for the next Pixar flick because this was really bad. I actually had to wake one of my kids up during the movie because it was so slow and silly.

Tangled had doubled love interests and comic reliefs, but at least it didn't do it in and completely unnecessary and annoying way. These characters are so stupid and wanted to make me throw up in my popcorn.Is Olaf really necessary? The reindeer?The movie would've gotten along fine without so many ridiculous and unnecessary characters.The third thing is the fake outs. That double love interest in this movie that Disney tries to pull the rug out from under you is exactly what I most hated about this movie, Disney has always done what is always done, one love interest and one conflict now there appears to be three. Where the Will Anna get married, or will she die from the ice thing's, or the true love kiss is no longer valuable, and where fake outs that are total BS. What the F! This movies tries so hard to pull the rug out from under you that it loses all sense of direction where the movie goes one way and then it goes the other .Disney always did things a certain way and know that a try ,three different it's what makes it bad, I for one love difference in new things but frozen tries too hard To win you over with its ridiculousness . Unnecessary songs, ridiculous characters, the things that Disney has always done and start appearing in this movie but then makes It completely different.Is there any reason why this movie needs to be so over pretentious?Worst Disney musical of all time, don't watch this movie under any circumstances!","['last', 'disney', 'musical', 'happen', 'two', 'year', 'something', 'think', 'agree', 'wait', 'long', 'enough', 'second', 'hear', 'come', 'new', 'one', 'get', 'excite', 'walk', 'movie', 'theater', 'want', 'slap', 'walt', 'disney', 'create', 'monstrosity', 'reason', 'go', 'back', 'disney', 'big', 'hero', 'six', 'would', 'completely', 'give', 'disney', 'reason', 'hate', 'movie', 'much', 'reason', 'first', 'thing', 'song', 'loathe', 'disney', 'prove', 'song', 'need', 'catchy', 'also', 'need', 'portray', 'emotion', 'goofy', 'stupid', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'irrelevant', 'plot', 'extremely', 'overrate', 'like', 'movie', 'second', 'thing', 'character', 'tangle', 'double', 'love', 'interest', 'comic', 'relief', 'least', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'annoy', 'way', 'character', 'stupid', 'want', 'make', 'throw', 'popcorn', 'olaf', 'really', 'necessary', 'reindeer', 'movie', 'would', 'gotten', 'along', 'fine', 'without', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'unnecessary', 'character', 'third', 'thing', 'fake', 'double', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'disney', 'try', 'pull', 'rug', 'exactly', 'hat', 'movie', 'disney', 'always', 'always', 'one', 'love', 'interest', 'one', 'conflict', 'appear', 'three', 'anna', 'get', 'married', 'die', 'ice', 'thing', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'longer', 'valuable', 'fake', 'total', 'b', 'f', 'movie', 'try', 'hard', 'pull', 'rug', 'loses', 'sense', 'direction', 'movie', 'go', 'one', 'way', 'go', 'disney', 'always', 'thing', 'certain', 'way', 'know', 'try', 'three', 'different', 'make', 'bad', 'one', 'love', 'difference', 'new', 'thing', 'frozen', 'try', 'hard', 'win', 'ridiculousness', 'unnecessary', 'song', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'thing', 'disney', 'always', 'start', 'appear', 'movie', 'make', 'completely', 'different', 'reason', 'movie', 'need', 'pretentious', 'bad', 'disney', 'musical', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'circumstance']","[197, 2, 51, 290, 42, 47, 89, 37, 729, 415, 169, 164, 319, 568, 40, 108, 10, 19, 447, 669, 1, 312, 59, 2384, 410, 2, 134, 4179, 180, 13, 74, 2, 106, 544, 1879, 26, 291, 57, 2, 180, 333, 1, 31, 180, 36, 43, 11, 2635, 2, 799, 11, 99, 266, 27, 99, 1018, 240, 961, 494, 291, 845, 2328, 52, 423, 426, 9, 1, 319, 43, 8, 83, 2177, 6, 122, 309, 297, 250, 291, 845, 238, 50, 8, 494, 59, 14, 744, 3434, 32, 22, 1496, 151, 1, 26, 1271, 172, 470, 137, 61, 1195, 845, 8, 715, 43, 1537, 2177, 6, 122, 1, 2, 87, 695, 3462, 522, 606, 1, 2, 163, 163, 10, 6, 122, 10, 552, 582, 433, 7, 19, 895, 368, 33, 43, 62, 6, 372, 612, 1880, 1537, 1479, 1569, 1272, 1, 87, 307, 695, 3462, 1410, 217, 754, 1, 13, 10, 50, 13, 2, 163, 43, 563, 50, 56, 87, 433, 140, 14, 65, 10, 6, 1164, 108, 43, 5, 87, 307, 374, 4180, 845, 11, 1195, 8, 43, 2, 163, 120, 582, 1, 14, 291, 140, 180, 1, 99, 3357, 65, 2, 51, 20, 23, 1, 2996]"

After many people saw it, they listened to the songs and hummed them. Especially the song ""Let it go"", it is the most famous one. The song mixes well with the scene in the movie and expresses Elsa's feelings well. Also the song was sung by several celebrities. I often listen to it. The influence of the movie is amazing. The number of spectator is more than ten million. Many products with these characters of the movie were sold. ""Anna"" is one of the characters. she liked her sister ""Elsa"" so much. Elsa had the ability to freeze anything It made her life gloomy. So she wanted to be isolated and went away from Anna. I felt sad. I could understand Anna's feeling, because when i'm alone, i often feel lonely. I hoped that she would meet Elsa again soon while i was seeing the movie. The sisters had a close relationship.

The characters were actually all great, even Else and Anna who i didn't see myself liking at first yet found them very likable. Olaf was obviously hilarious as well. i also really enjoyed the music, which has become very popular with fans. Kirsten Bell and all of the other voice actors did a great job, i was very impressed. im giving it 8 stars, which is very good.

95,1,"I never really go t the buzz about Frozen I think Disney has done much better before, maybe it had more merchandise for children to obsess about I don't really know. I preferred Tangled and other Disney films, I Think Frozen is extremely overrated and Frozen Fever even more so it is just a song and i think that the way the fans obsessed about Frozen Fever coming out they could have made something better. I only watched Frozen fever because it was forced upon me at the beginning of Cinderella. I think that people expect a lot from Frozen and Frozen Fever but my advice is not to expect it to be amazing. I went in watch Frozen and Frozen Fever with an open mind but I was disappointed I expected the film and its spin off short to be a lot better. So again I am disappointed. I think people honestly should show their children previous Disney films and I promise you they will enjoy them all much more than Frozen. I genuinely believe that their is much more merchandise, which I think is the main thing about Frozen. If children recognise something they have seen before they want it! In turn if their friends have it they want tit and as it is so easily accessible from £1 or 99p shops to the grandeur of The Disney store also from the likes or Youtube and other websites for the songs and movies it just makes the film more accessible making it more of a big deal. It is seriously not as amazing as you expect it to be. If you honesty think it is one of the best Disney film then you need to watch other Disney films.

96,7,"Frozen – Magic in white all over the screen freezing the audience with exquisite beauty and winsomeness. The story is somewhat similar to the same 'First love's kiss + king and queen' concept just as in all the other animated movies where love and fantasy is involved. Although there is only a little difference to the story-line, it appeals to be somewhat different and beautiful given the sheer brilliance in animation with 'Elsa', the elder sister and queen drizzling the power and magnificence of an ice queen into the screen. Since last four years when Rango, Up and Brave were awarded the Oscars it seemed like some biasing or rather prior booking was involved in the process. This time, it seemed a wee bit more satiable. 'The Croods' was the only contender for 'Frozen'. And definitely in terms of animation 'Frozen' had the capacity to outshine 'The Croods'; and it has to be added that its bad luck for 'The Croods' to have gotten released in the same year along with 'Frozen'. The song 'Let it go' will just freeze your mind and body while 'Elsa' the Ice Queen unleashes and let go of her power unconstrained and without fear. There is beauty and elegance in each swishing moves Elsa does with her wonderful magic in the song. Music should also be given the credit as it is of the highest standards. Though there are over a dozen songs in the movie one would never get frustrated over it. In fact with the starting of the movie itself where the track 'Vuelie' is played, our hearts get fascinated and magnetized towards the movie and we expect something really big - The first impression is the best impression. It's definitely 'true love' in terms of the script which is the base concept of the movie and definitely not Bestiality or Homosexuality like some critiques have put it. The movie is a treat for the eyes. Story-wise don't expect a miracle. But all together there is all the requisite mixing done in the movie enough to say 'It's a Beautiful ride'. Walt Disney has finally after a long time pulled one Oscar for itself and surely it has earned it. The animation, the beauty of the magical ice, the fabulous music and the beautiful faces and gestures of Elsa and Anna will stick to your heart for quite a long time after you finish watching the movie. It's a good pick if you want some relaxation and happiness with honey in your eyes & ears. Way to go Disney – Like shown in the starting of the movie, Mickey's spirit steered you towards this well deserving win.

97,3,"From a Dad's perspective it was painful to endure. Usually I research movies but this was family night, and a Disney kids movie, so we took our 3 boys 10, 6, 4. Some of the movie previews I saw did not paint a clear picture of the movie at all. First thing to note, this is a Full On MUSICAL. Before the movie even starts, you are stuck watching an old style MM cartoon that reminds me of why I never watched them when I was young. Wished it was played at the end. I am no masterful movie writer like some of the reviews I saw some people write up here. So from a mid-40 Dad's lame view, I thought the beginning and middle dragged...on...forever...(shoot me now). Also I do not think many of the characters were mixed in very well at all. The snowman existence and the ice herder is tied in poorly to the movie, like some of the other characters, IMO. I will say the last 20 minutes or so of the movie were good. In hind site this is something I would have let mom take the kids to. My wife also did not enjoy the movie, not sure she suffered like I did. Summary, not worth paying to see, wait for HBO or Netflix. People did clap at the end, which still baffles me when it happens at a movie theater. While suffering and starting to look around I saw a lot of people enjoying it.

98,8,"Anna, a fearless optimist, sets off on an epic journey – teaming up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his loyal reindeer Sven – to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. From the outside Anna's sister, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret-she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful ability, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.Frozen is one of the coolest comedy-adventure ever to hit the big screen.

Whether you are three or 83 there are important lessons scattered throughout encouraging all of us to embrace the uniqueness that makes us who we are. Persistent themes include bravery against your fears and kindness to both those whom you love and those who you might not get along with and the consequences of demonstrating both.

But when my classmate told me that Frozen is a very interesting and funny and great movie, I released I was wrong. My sixth sense told me that I must watch this film. Before I watch this movie, we sang the songs that are from Frozen in the music class, that's my first time listen Frozen' s music, the music is so beautiful that I never hear before. After that I wish I can watch Frozen, and that day came.I brought my heart to feel the movie, my brain to memorize the movie, my ears to hear the movie, that's all I got. I went to cinema with my family, I was exciting. After watching Frozen, I found my favorite Disney film. Disney had made many good film, but this is a one I fall in love with. I love the main character Elsa, even she is so afraid of her power...She is a great sister, she cares much about her sister Anna, Elsa hid herself because she didn't want to hurt people and family, especially Anna, she wants to protect them from her. That's the reason why I love Elsa. And I was so jealous of Anna, because she has a nice sister who is so cares of her.Anna is a optimistic and innocent character, I like her personality, but I like Elsa more. I can see a different me from Anna. And I like the part when Elsa hugged Anna, it made me cry. I remember ""Only the true love can thaw a frozen heart"". I thought the Anna's true love is Kristoff... I think no one guess right the end. And there is a part I like too, yes, is the part that Elsa was singing and made a ice castle. ""Let it go"" the song told me everything. The film taught me, don't listen to the people who want to hurts you, just be yourself. Elsa had hide and be afraid of her power, she has carried a big pressure when she was young until now. And this time, she can let it go, be herself, don't need to care much.Actually, I learned many things from Frozen, the things that are important and useful in my life. Frozen is one of my favorite cartoon film, it is a most powerful film I have seen. I watched Frozen five times, and I still want to watch it. I want to say my thank to Disney, that they have made this greatly film. I wish there will have many greatly film come out, the film like Frozen. After Frozen Fever came out, I was more exciting.

It also has some crazily quirky characters and they all play along in a bigger plot which isn't that easy to predict, or should I say, not your typical Disney princess story. The film in my opinion is just about a very good one and here below is why I felt that about it.The story as said is kind of a big adventure, not to ruin the main storyline for those of you planning to watch it but it contains a lot of different people and places which just make it generally good fun. It contains humour that can be for some very funny, typical animation style humour but without it the film would seem stale and unloved. One major part of the story and a reason I think so many people love this movie is the songs, the score and the lyrics then sung over are fantastic and really make this a movie to remember but also brings it out in a warm glow as well.The voice work for the movie is nice and I think they picked the right people for the job(and not only for the singing). Kristen Bell is just one of the voices you may recognise and her portrayal as Ana is fun and different yet not so different from other Disney princesses. Idina Menzel as Elsa has by far the most powerful voice in the movie and her singing is really brought out in possibly the most famous song from this movie ""Let it Go"". I liked Josh Gad as Olaf, his little voice matches Olaf perfectly and you will see why, and he also provides a lot of the humour.Of course adapting a Hans Christian Andersen story is going to be difficult, but I think Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee bring it well to the screen and there safe handed direction really works. The writers also do well, not sure how much of the original story is there but in any case the writers seem to do it some great justice. The look of this film is amazing, such slick animation with a beautiful flow of things, and when any things like ice is involved, the detail put into every little bit is immensely done well and just wonderful to look at among everything going on too.Main criticisms, well it has to be said the film probably isn't as good as certain people may have you believe, yes it's a fun Disney animation but that can also be the problem, over the top drama which can after a while annoy but it may not also. I said it has animation like humour before and that is also why I didn't think this was the perfect animation film, there aren't a lot of laughs to be had and even when characters such as Olaf try to provide that comic relief, the jokes aren't delivered that well, I will add though that kids will probably laugh a lot at this.Of course I will recommend this to any Disney fan, you can't get much more than this in there long line of films and is fast becoming one of the best known modern Disney films as well. I think this is definitely one for the children and don't tell boys they can't enjoy it, I think anyone of age or gender can have a great time with this film. If you dislike a good old sing song and a melodramatic kind of story then really, this isn't at all for you, some people will absolutely hate this but I think it depends on why you watch movies.Overall a Just About Very Good movie and one film that was hard to give a score. I think it may be so hard to rate because of the amount of people who say it is the best thing they have ever seen but then many also have heard people say that and feel it is overrated. Just go along with it, and even if you feel this isn't your type of movie then just try to enjoy it, don't hate it because of the characters or songs and you may just have found a gem of an animation movie.","['frozen', 'disney', 'animation', 'great', 'show', 'put', 'big', 'song', 'many', 'people', 'hard', 'hum', 'afterwards', 'style', 'look', 'seamless', 'truly', 'one', 'finer', 'movie', 'disney', 'produce', 'also', 'crazily', 'quirky', 'character', 'play', 'along', 'big', 'plot', 'easy', 'predict', 'say', 'typical', 'disney', 'princess', 'story', 'film', 'opinion', 'good', 'one', 'felt', 'story', 'say', 'kind', 'big', 'adventure', 'ruin', 'main', 'storyline', 'planning', 'watch', 'contains', 'lot', 'different', 'people', 'place', 'make', 'generally', 'good', 'fun', 'contains', 'humour', 'funny', 'typical', 'animation', 'style', 'humour', 'without', 'film', 'would', 'seem', 'stale', 'unloved', 'one', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'reason', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'love', 'movie', 'song', 'score', 'lyric', 'sung', 'fantastic', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'remember', 'also', 'brings', 'warm', 'glow', 'well', 'voice', 'work', 'movie', 'nice', 'think', 'picked', 'right', 'people', 'job', 'sing', 'kristen', 'bell', 'one', 'voice', 'may', 'recognise', 'portrayal', 'ana', 'fun', 'different', 'yet', 'different', 'disney', 'princess', 'idina', 'menzel', 'elsa', 'far', 'powerful', 'voice', 'movie', 'sing', 'really', 'brought', 'possibly', 'famous', 'song', 'movie', 'let', 'go', 'like', 'josh', 'gad', 'olaf', 'little', 'voice', 'match', 'olaf', 'perfectly', 'see', 'also', 'provide', 'lot', 'humour', 'course', 'adapt', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'story', 'go', 'difficult', 'think', 'chris', 'buck', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'bring', 'well', 'screen', 'safe', 'hand', 'direction', 'really', 'work', 'writer', 'also', 'well', 'sure', 'much', 'original', 'story', 'case', 'writer', 'seem', 'great', 'justice', 'look', 'film', 'amaze', 'slick', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'flow', 'thing', 'thing', 'like', 'ice', 'involve', 'detail', 'put', 'every', 'little', 'bit', 'immensely', 'well', 'wonderful', 'look', 'among', 'everything', 'go', 'main', 'criticism', 'well', 'say', 'film', 'probably', 'good', 'certain', 'people', 'may', 'believe', 'yes', 'fun', 'disney', 'animation', 'also', 'problem', 'top', 'drama', 'annoy', 'may', 'also', 'say', 'animation', 'like', 'humour', 'also', 'think', 'perfect', 'animation', 'film', 'lot', 'laugh', 'even', 'character', 'olaf', 'try', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'joke', 'deliver', 'well', 'add', 'though', 'kid', 'probably', 'laugh', 'lot', 'course', 'recommend', 'disney', 'fan', 'get', 'much', 'long', 'line', 'film', 'fast', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'know', 'modern', 'disney', 'film', 'well', 'think', 'definitely', 'one', 'child', 'tell', 'boy', 'enjoy', 'think', 'anyone', 'age', 'gender', 'great', 'time', 'film', 'dislike', 'good', 'old', 'sing', 'song', 'melodramatic', 'kind', 'story', 'really', 'people', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'think', 'depends', 'watch', 'movie', 'overall', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'film', 'hard', 'give', 'score', 'think', 'may', 'hard', 'rate', 'amount', 'people', 'say', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'see', 'many', 'also', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'feel', 'overrate', 'go', 'along', 'even', 'feel', 'type', 'movie', 'try', 'enjoy', 'hate', 'character', 'song', 'may', 'found', 'gem', 'animation', 'movie']","[5, 2, 21, 25, 78, 196, 106, 11, 61, 46, 307, 1048, 2391, 355, 66, 2668, 329, 10, 3485, 1, 2, 587, 27, 908, 8, 204, 172, 106, 52, 454, 2392, 35, 376, 2, 29, 12, 3, 258, 17, 10, 155, 12, 35, 193, 106, 326, 851, 119, 295, 1888, 23, 1054, 84, 140, 46, 188, 14, 1004, 17, 125, 1054, 732, 85, 376, 21, 355, 732, 137, 3, 26, 75, 4200, 10, 823, 94, 12, 180, 37, 61, 46, 6, 1, 11, 223, 475, 684, 253, 22, 14, 1, 391, 27, 509, 362, 2186, 18, 86, 107, 1, 192, 37, 2393, 130, 46, 373, 63, 162, 146, 10, 86, 171, 2658, 2669, 929, 125, 140, 182, 140, 2, 29, 141, 116, 4, 142, 439, 86, 1, 63, 22, 599, 842, 903, 11, 1, 30, 13, 9, 275, 257, 32, 48, 86, 553, 32, 456, 16, 27, 458, 84, 732, 228, 912, 44, 245, 339, 12, 13, 1113, 37, 526, 490, 464, 416, 221, 18, 369, 1174, 323, 754, 22, 107, 605, 27, 18, 207, 31, 230, 12, 514, 605, 75, 25, 3033, 66, 3, 96, 4201, 21, 93, 1183, 43, 43, 9, 33, 584, 468, 196, 115, 48, 95, 2625, 18, 215, 66, 471, 132, 13, 119, 1091, 18, 35, 3, 210, 17, 563, 46, 171, 220, 325, 125, 2, 21, 27, 198, 239, 745, 238, 171, 27, 35, 21, 9, 732, 27, 37, 175, 21, 3, 84, 190, 28, 8, 32, 87, 458, 309, 297, 451, 1050, 18, 269, 100, 60, 210, 190, 84, 228, 262, 2, 176, 19, 31, 169, 213, 3, 780, 179, 10, 34, 56, 324, 2, 3, 18, 37, 174, 10, 70, 143, 408, 91, 37, 299, 139, 1288, 25, 20, 3, 1116, 17, 64, 63, 11, 2145, 193, 12, 22, 46, 292, 333, 37, 3486, 23, 1, 166, 17, 1, 10, 3, 307, 57, 223, 37, 171, 307, 694, 624, 46, 35, 34, 43, 81, 16, 61, 27, 357, 46, 35, 53, 426, 13, 172, 28, 53, 524, 1, 87, 91, 333, 8, 11, 171, 231, 3034, 21, 1]"

106,5,"It's difficult be so honest about Disney films without alienating some people. My kids for a start will turn on me for giving this a mediocre score. But it is very just and I feel that most are being carried along with the child hype that surrounds Disney's latest entry.Musically, the film delivers, even though I am sick to death of the songs that one of my daughters continuously screeches while wrapping up in blankets to imitate the princesses. But it is here where Disney lead and hypnotise an audience into believing that their film is a masterpiece. However, if you stand your ground and look beneath the songs, you will see a story that is in place BUT its scenes remain isolated and disconnected from one another.It also feels like Disney had realised this, and then filled the gaps with the snowman Olaf. Rather than be a centre figure, like what has been suggested, he is more of the scene filler. He does bring humour, but it just feels like it was a late idea.The story itself is reasonable, and the story is told well via the music, but scripting does not connect the scenes and so you are left with empty sections. This is also felt with some of the characters, that have no value to the film and you have no emotion for them either.If we compare this film to a recent one, Tangled, if dwarfs in comparison. Tangled ticked all the right boxes with a great story, comedy combined perfectly, excellent writing and at the end it left you felling great. At the end of Frozen I felt like giving a shrug and then moved on. When you think Tangled did not receive as much notice in comparison then it only leads me to think that somehow it is something else that has sold this movie rather than it being an excellent film. Whether it be a musical style, or even great advertising, it just doesn't quite add up.It is not a poor film but it is not brilliant either, and it certainly doesn't live up to its hype but kids will definitely love it.GIFT-A-SCALE: 6 out of 14","['difficult', 'honest', 'disney', 'film', 'without', 'alienate', 'people', 'kid', 'start', 'turn', 'give', 'mediocre', 'score', 'feel', 'carry', 'along', 'child', 'hype', 'surround', 'disney', 'late', 'entry', 'musically', 'film', 'delivers', 'even', 'though', 'sick', 'death', 'song', 'one', 'daughter', 'continuously', 'screech', 'wrap', 'blanket', 'imitate', 'princess', 'disney', 'lead', 'hypnotise', 'audience', 'believe', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'however', 'stand', 'ground', 'look', 'beneath', 'song', 'see', 'story', 'place', 'scene', 'remain', 'isolated', 'disconnect', 'one', 'another', 'also', 'feel', 'like', 'disney', 'realise', 'fill', 'gap', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'rather', 'centre', 'figure', 'like', 'suggest', 'scene', 'filler', 'bring', 'humour', 'feel', 'like', 'late', 'idea', 'story', 'reasonable', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'via', 'music', 'script', 'connect', 'scene', 'left', 'empty', 'section', 'also', 'felt', 'character', 'value', 'film', 'emotion', 'either', 'compare', 'film', 'recent', 'one', 'tangle', 'dwarf', 'comparison', 'tangle', 'ticked', 'right', 'box', 'great', 'story', 'comedy', 'combine', 'perfectly', 'excellent', 'write', 'end', 'left', 'fell', 'great', 'end', 'frozen', 'felt', 'like', 'give', 'shrug', 'move', 'think', 'tangle', 'receive', 'much', 'notice', 'comparison', 'lead', 'think', 'somehow', 'something', 'else', 'sell', 'movie', 'rather', 'excellent', 'film', 'whether', 'musical', 'style', 'even', 'great', 'advertising', 'quite', 'add', 'poor', 'film', 'brilliant', 'either', 'certainly', 'live', 'hype', 'kid', 'definitely', 'love', 'gift', 'scale']","[1113, 742, 2, 3, 137, 2670, 46, 60, 120, 113, 57, 752, 223, 53, 853, 172, 70, 406, 1353, 2, 530, 1889, 1769, 3, 1143, 28, 100, 2158, 517, 11, 10, 389, 2569, 1735, 3488, 4205, 29, 2, 248, 159, 220, 3, 461, 110, 361, 1051, 66, 3489, 11, 16, 12, 188, 90, 1436, 782, 4054, 10, 102, 27, 53, 9, 2, 1544, 481, 1770, 45, 32, 191, 2187, 630, 9, 1049, 90, 1504, 221, 732, 53, 9, 530, 281, 12, 2188, 12, 511, 18, 3037, 58, 395, 1397, 90, 330, 1538, 2185, 27, 155, 8, 728, 3, 240, 353, 350, 3, 399, 10, 83, 1573, 1126, 83, 130, 598, 25, 12, 279, 1096, 456, 298, 165, 41, 330, 843, 25, 41, 5, 155, 9, 57, 242, 37, 83, 852, 31, 692, 1126, 248, 37, 981, 89, 270, 718, 1, 191, 298, 3, 638, 51, 355, 28, 25, 2138, 124, 269, 973, 3, 523, 353, 442, 224, 406, 60, 174, 6, 832, 1827]"

With Frozen, however, I can't put my finger on ""one reason"" why I liked it so much...it was kind of more of a ""package deal"".For a basic plot summary, Frozen tells the story of two sisters born of royal blood, Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell). While very close as young sisters, the women drift apart in adulthood after an accident in which Elsa's ice-creating magical powers hurts Elsa. Determined not to hurt anyone ever again, Elsa absconds the royalty and creates her own castle far into the wilderness. The only problem? She has left her hometown in a perpetual state of winter. As such, young sis Anna sets out to find Elsa and set things right, along the way meeting up with mountain-man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and snowman-come-to-life Olaf (Josh Gad).Like I said, there is no one thing about this movie that really makes it stand out compared to previous Disney efforts. It is just the combination of everything that make it such an enjoyable experience. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, humor abounds, the visuals are astounding, and the music is enthralling. There never seems to be a lacking moment in the whole 104-minute spectacle.So, despite not being able to hang my hat on that ""one attribute"", Frozen is primarily such an enjoyable experience because it has a little bit of everything. I could see myself watching it again in the near future!","['young', 'sibling', 'expose', 'disney', 'animate', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'usually', 'see', 'one', 'well', 'one', 'pinpoint', 'exactly', 'like', 'toy', 'story', 'ability', 'relate', 'character', 'tangle', 'instance', 'story', 'sad', 'help', 'root', 'protagonist', 'frozen', 'however', 'put', 'finger', 'one', 'reason', 'like', 'much', 'kind', 'package', 'deal', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'frozen', 'tell', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'born', 'royal', 'blood', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'close', 'young', 'sister', 'woman', 'drift', 'apart', 'adulthood', 'accident', 'elsa', 'ice', 'create', 'magical', 'power', 'hurt', 'elsa', 'determine', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'ever', 'elsa', 'absconds', 'royalty', 'creates', 'castle', 'far', 'wilderness', 'problem', 'left', 'hometown', 'perpetual', 'state', 'winter', 'young', 'si', 'anna', 'set', 'find', 'elsa', 'set', 'thing', 'right', 'along', 'way', 'meeting', 'mountain', 'man', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'snowman', 'come', 'life', 'olaf', 'josh', 'gad', 'like', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'really', 'make', 'stand', 'compare', 'previous', 'disney', 'effort', 'combination', 'everything', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'story', 'engage', 'character', 'interest', 'humor', 'abounds', 'visuals', 'astound', 'music', 'enthral', 'never', 'seem', 'lack', 'moment', 'whole', 'minute', 'spectacle', 'despite', 'able', 'hang', 'hat', 'one', 'attribute', 'frozen', 'primarily', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'could', 'see', 'watch', 'near', 'future']","[73, 409, 1318, 2, 38, 1, 210, 26, 460, 16, 10, 18, 10, 4206, 522, 9, 463, 12, 367, 785, 8, 83, 1758, 12, 579, 135, 885, 354, 5, 110, 196, 1745, 10, 180, 9, 31, 193, 4207, 701, 1088, 52, 1432, 5, 143, 12, 42, 15, 589, 870, 2359, 4, 141, 116, 7, 162, 146, 351, 73, 15, 251, 2395, 512, 3018, 480, 4, 33, 134, 170, 24, 305, 4, 993, 305, 299, 81, 4, 2650, 797, 168, 142, 1752, 198, 330, 4208, 1437, 881, 105, 73, 3346, 7, 144, 71, 4, 144, 43, 130, 172, 50, 1574, 214, 145, 67, 455, 377, 45, 40, 79, 32, 275, 257, 9, 35, 10, 43, 1, 22, 14, 361, 350, 763, 2, 575, 1414, 132, 14, 306, 334, 12, 619, 8, 122, 222, 3491, 267, 1847, 58, 2189, 88, 75, 273, 133, 127, 211, 1506, 313, 294, 2396, 606, 10, 4209, 5, 2013, 306, 334, 48, 95, 132, 54, 16, 23, 449, 607]"

110,8,"I had high expectations with this film, it being the Academy Award winner for best animated motion picture and being the highest grossing movie of the year 2013 and highest grossing animated movie ever. Despite the trailer of Frozen looking really good, and many people praising it, when I finally got a chance to watch this spectacle of ice and snow, I was left disappointed. Based on a loose and clichéd storyline that starts off really well, it gets slow and boring and only at the climax where there's an interesting twist. The visuals of ice and snow are terrific, so are the songs, and I think 'Let it go' deserves the academy award. The snowman, Olaf keeps you entertained but he can also do only so much. The only good thing apart from Visuals and songs was the relationship between the two sisters. And the scenes having both sisters are the only good moments in the film, be it when they build a snowman or one sister sacrifices herself to save the other sister, and vice-versa. Apart from that, only the snowman, Olaf, makes you smile and feel good. Everything else feels like fillers. I did enjoy the film. It is not a complete failure, but I was left disappointed. This may be the highest grossing animated film for reasons beyond my understanding but I have seen better animated films by Disney.","['high', 'expectation', 'film', 'academy', 'award', 'winner', 'best', 'animate', 'motion', 'picture', 'high', 'gross', 'movie', 'year', 'high', 'gross', 'animate', 'movie', 'ever', 'despite', 'trailer', 'frozen', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'praise', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'spectacle', 'ice', 'snow', 'left', 'disappointed', 'base', 'loose', 'clich', 'storyline', 'start', 'really', 'well', 'get', 'slow', 'boring', 'climax', 'interest', 'twist', 'visuals', 'ice', 'snow', 'terrific', 'song', 'think', 'let', 'go', 'deserves', 'academy', 'award', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'keep', 'entertain', 'also', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'apart', 'visuals', 'song', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'scene', 'sister', 'good', 'moment', 'film', 'build', 'snowman', 'one', 'sister', 'sacrifice', 'save', 'sister', 'vice', 'versa', 'apart', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'make', 'smile', 'feel', 'good', 'everything', 'else', 'feel', 'like', 'filler', 'enjoy', 'film', 'complete', 'failure', 'left', 'disappointed', 'may', 'high', 'gross', 'animate', 'film', 'reason', 'beyond', 'understand', 'see', 'well', 'animate', 'film', 'disney']","[206, 452, 3, 856, 469, 1419, 34, 38, 1507, 438, 206, 783, 1, 47, 206, 783, 38, 1, 81, 313, 394, 5, 66, 22, 17, 61, 46, 535, 241, 19, 632, 23, 1506, 33, 39, 330, 476, 256, 937, 274, 295, 120, 22, 18, 19, 1065, 370, 792, 122, 129, 267, 33, 39, 1415, 11, 37, 30, 13, 592, 856, 469, 45, 32, 154, 243, 27, 31, 17, 43, 512, 267, 11, 153, 42, 15, 90, 15, 17, 133, 3, 202, 45, 10, 15, 635, 111, 15, 3038, 3493, 512, 45, 32, 14, 914, 53, 17, 132, 270, 53, 9, 1504, 91, 3, 656, 1623, 330, 476, 171, 206, 783, 38, 3, 180, 614, 216, 16, 18, 38, 3, 2]"

112,10,"I feel proud to live at a time where I can see this in theaters. This must be similar to what it felt like to be in the golden age of Disney. I'm really struggling to find the words to convey how amazing this movie was, and how honestly depressing it was that my theater was nearly empty for the showing.I'm keeping the story summary brief and spoiler-free. Once upon a time, there were two sisters, Elsa and Anna, princesses of the kingdom of Arendelle. The elder sister, Elsa, was born with the ability create and control ice and snow. She was forced to hide this power due to an unfortunate accident, and, as a result, when her powers came out during her coronation, they were too powerful for her to control, and resulted in the kingdom being locked in a blizzard during summer. She runs away, and her sister, Anna, goes out to bring her back. And that's all I'm saying. The first ten minutes had me crying and then near the end I dropped my soda. I can count on my fingers how many recent films have made me cry, I can count on one finger how many films have made me drop a soda. Nearly everything about this film was jaw-droppingly amazing. The animation, especially a section where Elsa shows the full extent of her ice powers is absolutely stunning. The film is a Disney musical, so it has a lot of songs. There were only two real misfires out of the entire soundtrack, and nearly all of the rest were great. And yes, even the Disney Princess of a main character, Anna, seemed like a real person, and is far better than any Disney Princess I can think of. And Elsa is as close to perfect as I can imagine, she's animated beautifully and acts realistically. Well, as realistically as a Disney Princess with Ice Magic powers. The other characters are also nearly all great, and even the comic relief snowman (who the trailers are focusing on way too much)has some surprising moments.No film is without its flaws, but some films are good enough that you can suspend your disbelief for them. No, they don't explain why Elsa has the ice powers, other than that she was born with them. Yes, she can use them like a pro after suppressing them for most of her life. Yes, there are several moments when everyone should have died. Thing is, the rest of the film is so great you don't focus on that. I can't think of a better film to take the family to this Holiday season, so get out and see this future Disney Classic.","['feel', 'proud', 'live', 'time', 'see', 'theater', 'must', 'similar', 'felt', 'like', 'golden', 'age', 'disney', 'really', 'struggle', 'find', 'word', 'convey', 'amaze', 'movie', 'honestly', 'depress', 'theater', 'nearly', 'empty', 'show', 'keep', 'story', 'summary', 'brief', 'spoiler', 'free', 'upon', 'time', 'two', 'sister', 'elsa', 'anna', 'princess', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'elder', 'sister', 'elsa', 'born', 'ability', 'create', 'control', 'ice', 'snow', 'force', 'hide', 'power', 'due', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'result', 'power', 'come', 'coronation', 'powerful', 'control', 'result', 'kingdom', 'lock', 'blizzard', 'summer', 'run', 'away', 'sister', 'anna', 'go', 'bring', 'back', 'say', 'first', 'ten', 'minute', 'cry', 'near', 'end', 'drop', 'soda', 'count', 'finger', 'many', 'recent', 'film', 'make', 'cry', 'count', 'one', 'finger', 'many', 'film', 'make', 'drop', 'soda', 'nearly', 'everything', 'film', 'jaw', 'droppingly', 'amaze', 'animation', 'especially', 'section', 'elsa', 'show', 'full', 'extent', 'ice', 'power', 'absolutely', 'stun', 'film', 'disney', 'musical', 'lot', 'song', 'two', 'real', 'misfire', 'entire', 'soundtrack', 'nearly', 'rest', 'great', 'yes', 'even', 'disney', 'princess', 'main', 'character', 'anna', 'seem', 'like', 'real', 'person', 'far', 'well', 'disney', 'princess', 'think', 'elsa', 'close', 'perfect', 'imagine', 'animate', 'beautifully', 'act', 'realistically', 'well', 'realistically', 'disney', 'princess', 'ice', 'magic', 'power', 'character', 'also', 'nearly', 'great', 'even', 'comic', 'relief', 'snowman', 'trailer', 'focus', 'way', 'much', 'surprising', 'moment', 'film', 'without', 'flaw', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'explain', 'elsa', 'ice', 'power', 'born', 'yes', 'use', 'like', 'pro', 'suppress', 'life', 'yes', 'several', 'moment', 'everyone', 'die', 'thing', 'rest', 'film', 'great', 'focus', 'think', 'well', 'film', 'take', 'family', 'holiday', 'season', 'get', 'see', 'future', 'disney', 'classic']","[53, 1408, 224, 20, 16, 312, 236, 446, 155, 9, 796, 139, 2, 22, 639, 71, 548, 2190, 96, 1, 542, 2364, 312, 501, 1538, 78, 154, 12, 1432, 1661, 419, 593, 554, 20, 42, 15, 4, 7, 29, 77, 199, 1139, 15, 4, 589, 367, 134, 128, 33, 39, 272, 676, 24, 404, 1555, 480, 648, 24, 40, 343, 439, 128, 648, 77, 382, 1508, 205, 233, 101, 15, 7, 13, 221, 74, 35, 36, 829, 211, 505, 449, 41, 1207, 3435, 1430, 1745, 61, 399, 3, 14, 505, 1430, 10, 1745, 61, 3, 14, 1207, 3435, 501, 132, 3, 2342, 4211, 96, 21, 121, 2185, 4, 78, 246, 2397, 33, 24, 292, 315, 3, 2, 51, 84, 11, 42, 195, 3494, 264, 225, 501, 303, 25, 325, 28, 2, 29, 119, 8, 7, 75, 9, 195, 441, 142, 18, 2, 29, 37, 4, 351, 175, 1137, 38, 529, 112, 3039, 18, 3039, 2, 29, 33, 150, 24, 8, 27, 501, 25, 28, 309, 297, 45, 394, 261, 50, 31, 1029, 133, 3, 137, 386, 3, 17, 164, 4212, 2672, 400, 4, 33, 24, 589, 325, 158, 9, 1319, 1885, 79, 325, 608, 133, 109, 368, 43, 303, 3, 25, 261, 37, 18, 3, 55, 72, 1039, 1040, 19, 16, 607, 2, 69]"

114,9,"Disney has made many films that have become classics like ""The Little Mermaid"" And ""The Lion King"" of course that was during the Disney Renaissance where they would make musical animation films with powerful story telling, Animation work that is top notch as well as Songs that have remain hits today like they were back then.Frozen has that feel that it could begin the second Disney Renaissance since it is one of the few films from Disney that has a story and musical feel to it.My nieces love this film and I have to say it is quite the movie it just has a lot going for it. The plot of the film is that Anna (Kristen Bell) must search for her older sister Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) who has the power to create snow and ice and has accidentally turn the Kingdom into a frozen ice winter. Anna teams up with Mountain Man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) his trusted Reindeer Sven and a snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) to change what Elsa has done. Hans (Santino Fontana) Frozen story is quite strong and clever for a Disney film. What is the strong point of the film is the music which is wonderfully done. It helps move the film along as each piece of music written for the film match it just right. Of Course the film features original songs which are what make Frozen famous My top five favorite songs are 5: ""Do You Want To Build a Snowman"" 4: ""Frozen Heart"" 3: ""Love Is a Open Door""/ ""In Summer"" 2: ""Let It Go"" 1: ""For The First Time In Forever"". Each song for the film is well written and express emotion from the characters. Plus who knew Kristen Bell could sing I mean it really impress me to know she could sing like a bird sure we knew Idina Menzel could sing but wow Kristen really is impressive with her singing voice when you hear her in the film you'll be impress.As for the voice acting it is superb, with each cast member matching each character right and you can feel the emotion of the characters they can make you laugh, feel for them. They really brought these characters to life like Anna, Elsa and Olaf. The Animation is beautiful with great effects and backgrounds that really are quite amazing to look at, the characters are well design well animated it just feels like they took the time to match each animation to the Tee.

118,9,"When I first saw the teaser trailer for Frozen in the theater, I was only mildly interested. Sure, it was funny enough, but nothing really special; just a snowman and a reindeer engaging in some slapstick. Then, when the movie came out, all I heard about was how good it is, how amazing the songs were, and things like that. This lead to me getting very interested in seeing it, and eventually I got the movie when it was released on DVD. And I loved it.Frozen is a heartwarming, well-done, and beautifully animated movie proving that Disney is back as a quality animation company. The songs are great; my personal favorites were ""Let it Go"" and ""For the First Time in Forever."" Olaf, despite what I had initially expected, was (in my opinion) Disney'd best comic relief sidekick since The Lion King. He wasn't even in the more emotional/serious scenes, and during the scenes he was in, he was actually pretty funny. I liked that Frozen focused more on familial love than romantic love. The twist at the end is surprising (or it would be if it hadn't become a case of It Was His Sled). Also, Elsa was a complex, interesting character, and she's definitely one of my all-time favorites.My only complaint is the fact that Disney has gotten really lazy with their models for female characters. Anna, Elsa, and their mother are pretty much the same woman with different hair colors, hair styles, and eye colors. I believe a Disney animator actually said that they took Anna's model and tweaked it slightly to make Elsa. I know they're related, but come on. The fact that they also look remarkably similar to Rapunzel (and that Honey Lemon in Disney's upcoming Big Hero Six looks just like Rapunzel) really doesn't help matters.Overall, Frozen was a great, enjoyable movie. I would definitely recommend it.","['first', 'saw', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'frozen', 'theater', 'mildly', 'interested', 'sure', 'funny', 'enough', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'snowman', 'reindeer', 'engage', 'slapstick', 'movie', 'come', 'heard', 'good', 'amaze', 'song', 'thing', 'like', 'lead', 'get', 'interested', 'see', 'eventually', 'get', 'movie', 'release', 'dvd', 'love', 'frozen', 'heartwarming', 'well', 'beautifully', 'animate', 'movie', 'prove', 'disney', 'back', 'quality', 'animation', 'company', 'song', 'great', 'personal', 'favorite', 'let', 'go', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'olaf', 'despite', 'initially', 'expect', 'opinion', 'disney', 'best', 'comic', 'relief', 'sidekick', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'even', 'emotional', 'serious', 'scene', 'scene', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'like', 'frozen', 'focus', 'familial', 'love', 'romantic', 'love', 'twist', 'end', 'surprising', 'would', 'become', 'case', 'sled', 'also', 'elsa', 'complex', 'interest', 'character', 'definitely', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'complaint', 'fact', 'disney', 'gotten', 'really', 'lazy', 'model', 'female', 'character', 'anna', 'elsa', 'mother', 'pretty', 'much', 'woman', 'different', 'hair', 'color', 'hair', 'style', 'eye', 'color', 'believe', 'disney', 'animator', 'actually', 'say', 'take', 'anna', 'model', 'tweaked', 'slightly', 'make', 'elsa', 'know', 'related', 'come', 'fact', 'also', 'look', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'rapunzel', 'honey', 'lemon', 'disney', 'upcoming', 'big', 'hero', 'six', 'look', 'like', 'rapunzel', 'really', 'help', 'matter', 'overall', 'frozen', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']","[36, 157, 1773, 394, 5, 312, 1630, 946, 207, 85, 164, 156, 22, 316, 45, 151, 619, 1751, 1, 40, 357, 17, 96, 11, 43, 9, 248, 19, 946, 16, 652, 19, 1, 288, 540, 6, 5, 803, 18, 529, 38, 1, 799, 2, 74, 283, 21, 789, 11, 25, 537, 189, 30, 13, 36, 20, 287, 32, 313, 2026, 131, 258, 2, 34, 309, 297, 436, 98, 152, 97, 28, 342, 835, 90, 90, 103, 136, 85, 9, 5, 261, 3041, 6, 393, 6, 129, 41, 1029, 26, 179, 514, 2398, 27, 4, 771, 122, 8, 174, 10, 20, 189, 897, 201, 2, 1271, 22, 1373, 753, 237, 8, 7, 4, 883, 136, 31, 251, 140, 844, 651, 844, 355, 336, 651, 220, 2, 812, 103, 35, 55, 7, 753, 774, 14, 4, 56, 1312, 40, 201, 27, 66, 2673, 446, 527, 4194, 2, 2674, 106, 544, 1879, 66, 9, 527, 22, 135, 375, 166, 5, 25, 306, 1, 26, 174, 262]"
119,9,"My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)Frozen opens up with rhythmic chanting through the Disney and WDAS logos and the opening title. This is immediately followed by a scene involving a group of ice harvesters slicing ice from a frozen lake and singing about ice, fear, and frozen hearts. This opening sets the right tone and foreshadows some of the film's underlying themes. It also has something of an ambitious feel to it, as if this film were daring to aim for the level of Beauty and the Beast and some of Disney's other best films. In my opinion, Frozen is not as good as these films, and it is not a masterpiece by any means; and frankly I think it's overrated. But I still found it to be a good movie.Frozen is the story of sisters Anna and Elsa, the princesses of Arendelle. Elsa has magical powers to create ice and snow. These sisters were very close when they were little, until an incident where Elsa almost kills her younger sister with her powers. Their parents take Anna to some trolls who save her and erase her memories of Elsa's powers. After this, the sisters are separated and grow apart over the years. Years later, their parents die at sea, and three years after this, Elsa reaches the age at which she can become Queen. On coronation day, Anna meets Hans, a prince of another kingdom. She falls in love with him and wants to get engaged – that same day. In the ensuing argument with Elsa, Elsa inadvertently releases her powers. She then flees, unintentionally leaving the kingdom in a magically induced winter. Anna goes after her, along the way acquiring the help of an ice harvester, Kristoff, and his reindeer, Sven.Despite the immense hype surrounding this film, some negative reviewers have claimed that the film is shallow, simplistic, messy, and empty. In my opinion, however, not only is it not, but it's also heavy with subtleties, symbolism, and subtext; and I found it to be relatable and thought provoking to a considerable degree. I will admit that the storyline itself is fairly simple and predictable. But overall, I found the story to be decent and effective, with some valuable morals including, but not limited to, the true meaning of love, overcoming one's fears, and accepting people for who they are.The primary factor that makes the story work is the characters. The relationship between Anna and Elsa is what constitutes the film's emotional core. I was able to relate to both both of these characters, and Kristoff, to some degree. The animators really took the time to craft these three characters, giving them well-rounded, well-nuanced personalities, genuine emotional depth, and excellent physical appearances; not to mention the superlative voice performances by the cast. The animators even paid excellent attention to all of their mannerisms, tics, facial expression, and other details (even very small ones). These three characters felt to me like real people, and not two dimensional stereotypes.Another strength of the film is the music. Christophe Beck did a good job composing the score; and Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez did a good job writing the songs, my favorites of which are ""For the First Time in Forever,"" ""Let It Go,"" ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman,"" and ""Frozen Heart."" The songs are not excellent, but they are pretty good, and they help develop the characters and move the story along pretty well.Some modern filmmakers, especially Michael Bay, could really learn a thing or two from movies like Frozen. I cannot deny that the animation in Frozen is very good, and the film would not have worked without it. Fortunately, however, directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee actually care about other things as well: character development, relationships, heart, storytelling, and so forth. The film actually has a warm, genuine heart of its own under all of that digital snow and ice. Also, instead of just serving as a flashy distraction, the animation is actually used to service the script (not the other way around).Now, again, I honestly think the film is good, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. In addition to myriad missed opportunities, this film has its flaws. I found the film's second act to be a bit insipid and a little too heavy in comedy. Sure, it was funny, but it occasionally upset the comedy/drama balance, thereby preventing the second act from having the same emotional punch that the first and third acts have. Also, I felt that the story was slightly rushed and compressed. In fact, the film contains enough material for a TV miniseries. The film is solid and coherent as it is, but I still think a slightly longer running length would have done it a lot of good. Oh, and the villain is pretty weak - contrived and paper-thin (yes, there is a villain, but he is secondary to the primary conflict).Personally I think Frozen is the best of the five Disney Revival films so far, beating out Tangled by a whisker. Disney has successfully moved into the 21st century. For the most part, they have succeeded in combining their older elements with modern ones.Frozen is now the highest grossing animated film to date. At the same time, it's also receiving the harsh backlash that films this successful often receive. I personally think Frozen is overrated, but it's still good – charming, heartfelt, humorous, emotional, and overall entertaining - and it's one of my favorite films of 2013. Disney may not have the charisma they used to have, but at least they still know how to make a good movie.For more reviews, and my full review of Frozen (what you have just read is a truncated version

I can't remember an animated film with a story this good since Toy Story 3.Acting- 9/10Well, voice acting is always harder to rate than screen acting. However I found the characters to have good voices that weren't annoying singers.Direction- 10/10Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee did amazing directing in Frozen, with beautiful scenes and character speech and movement.Stray ThoughtsThe singing was brilliant, one of a few Disney movies that have songs that are worth paying and/or downloading. The animation was impeccable and the humour was well thought out and genuinely funnyOverall- 9.7/10Absolutely loved the film, with many strong and memorable moments.

125,9,"During the Thanksgiving weekend, I prepared myself to try to catch this in theaters with my siblings (OK, it's the same review as before, but it's in another account I made almost four months ago in case you don't know) to see if it would really exceed my expectations like the trailers had promised. Later, it turned out that it did and to my surprise, it's a great comeback to the classic Disney style that reminded me of the Golden Age and the Renaissance. Seriously, I'm placing this in one of my top 50 favorite Disney animated films.The story, loosely based on the fairy tale from Hans Christian Anderson, is very compelling it succeeded in bringing back the old formula that made the other Disney films successful. It has the princess, a handsome hero, the villain, a comic relief, and musical numbers. Not only that, it has wonderful characters.Anna is a likable heroine with her fearless quality and will do anything to help her sister, Elsa. Elsa almost looks like a Disney villain, but her back-story and the way she is seen as a monster due to her ice powers made me felt sorry for her. Kristoff is an endearing second main character and helps Anna in the rest of the movie. Olaf and the reindeer are no doubt great comic relief characters. Their humorous moments make them scene-stealers. Hans looks like a prince charming at first, but as a villain, his motives explains the reason why he's evil and he's very convincing. The voice acting is solid with Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel (known for playing Elphaba in Wicked), Jonathan Groff, Santino Fontana, Josh Grad, and Alan Tudyk.The writing is strong and the dialog is witty. The music score from Christophe Beck is great and the songs are great. Not as memorable as the other Disney films, but has a lot of energy, which makes them epic.The best part, however, would have to go to the animation. The character designs are solid, but the best thing is the visuals. Arendelle is great, but the Ice Castle made by Elsa is beautiful to look at. Disney, the way you did that is so timeless I'll never stop looking at it.Overall, Frozen is a great comeback to the classic Disney style and is easily one of the best films of not only 2013, but the best Disney Animation Film in the history of Hollywood. This deserves a thumbs up from me! :)","['thanksgiving', 'weekend', 'prepared', 'try', 'catch', 'theater', 'sibling', 'ok', 'review', 'another', 'account', 'make', 'almost', 'four', 'month', 'ago', 'case', 'know', 'see', 'would', 'really', 'exceed', 'expectation', 'like', 'trailer', 'promise', 'later', 'turn', 'surprise', 'great', 'comeback', 'classic', 'disney', 'style', 'remind', 'golden', 'age', 'renaissance', 'seriously', 'place', 'one', 'top', 'favorite', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'story', 'loosely', 'base', 'fairy', 'tale', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'compelling', 'succeed', 'bring', 'back', 'old', 'formula', 'make', 'disney', 'film', 'successful', 'princess', 'handsome', 'hero', 'villain', 'comic', 'relief', 'musical', 'number', 'wonderful', 'character', 'anna', 'likable', 'heroine', 'fearless', 'quality', 'anything', 'help', 'sister', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'almost', 'look', 'like', 'disney', 'villain', 'back', 'story', 'way', 'see', 'monster', 'due', 'ice', 'power', 'make', 'felt', 'sorry', 'kristoff', 'endear', 'second', 'main', 'character', 'help', 'anna', 'rest', 'movie', 'olaf', 'reindeer', 'doubt', 'great', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'humorous', 'moment', 'make', 'scene', 'stealer', 'han', 'look', 'like', 'prince', 'charm', 'first', 'villain', 'motif', 'explains', 'reason', 'evil', 'convincing', 'voice', 'act', 'solid', 'kristen', 'bell', 'idina', 'menzel', 'know', 'play', 'elphaba', 'wicked', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'santino', 'fontana', 'josh', 'grad', 'alan', 'tudyk', 'write', 'strong', 'dialog', 'witty', 'music', 'score', 'christophe', 'beck', 'great', 'song', 'great', 'memorable', 'disney', 'film', 'lot', 'energy', 'make', 'epic', 'best', 'part', 'however', 'would', 'go', 'animation', 'character', 'design', 'solid', 'best', 'thing', 'visuals', 'arendelle', 'great', 'ice', 'castle', 'make', 'elsa', 'beautiful', 'look', 'disney', 'way', 'timeless', 'never', 'stop', 'look', 'overall', 'frozen', 'great', 'comeback', 'classic', 'disney', 'style', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'best', 'disney', 'animation', 'film', 'history', 'hollywood', 'deserves', 'thumb']","[2678, 2010, 1964, 87, 1321, 312, 409, 477, 161, 102, 1732, 14, 173, 784, 860, 683, 514, 56, 16, 26, 22, 1669, 452, 9, 394, 1499, 358, 113, 445, 25, 2679, 69, 2, 355, 1047, 796, 139, 465, 667, 188, 10, 239, 189, 2, 38, 3, 12, 696, 256, 219, 114, 44, 245, 467, 1239, 1101, 221, 74, 64, 534, 14, 2, 3, 814, 29, 739, 544, 104, 309, 297, 51, 184, 215, 8, 7, 402, 565, 1434, 283, 212, 135, 15, 4, 4, 173, 66, 9, 2, 104, 74, 12, 50, 16, 495, 404, 33, 24, 14, 155, 777, 67, 1478, 319, 119, 8, 135, 7, 303, 1, 32, 151, 681, 25, 309, 297, 8, 1135, 133, 14, 90, 2409, 44, 66, 9, 82, 235, 36, 104, 1896, 1497, 180, 277, 2032, 86, 112, 664, 162, 146, 141, 116, 56, 204, 2680, 678, 455, 377, 688, 665, 275, 1134, 1426, 165, 167, 1187, 1216, 58, 223, 1357, 1307, 25, 11, 25, 268, 2, 3, 84, 1338, 14, 566, 34, 94, 110, 26, 13, 21, 8, 424, 664, 34, 43, 267, 199, 25, 33, 168, 14, 4, 93, 66, 2, 50, 1566, 88, 284, 66, 166, 5, 25, 2679, 69, 2, 355, 403, 10, 34, 3, 34, 2, 21, 3, 636, 1714, 592, 3050]"

127,8,"I've been a big Disney fan since I was a little girl. Sadly, I didn't see Frozen when it was in theaters. The main reason was I didn't really pay much attention to advertisement for the movie. After hearing how Frozen was getting reviews about how amazing it was, I bought the Blu- Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack in April last year. When I watched the movie, I thought Frozen was a decent entry to the Disney library.My main problem with the movie is the storyline. Some parts were far- fetched like how the parents handled Elsa's powers after the accident. Separating the two sisters and isolating Elsa only caused her powers to get out of hand at times. At least, Anna and Elsa turned out just fine after a decade of barely seeing each other. The addition of Grand Pappie and the other rock trolls was ridiculous. The rock trolls add nothing to the story. Also, they could've explained how to handle Elsa's powers better which would've made things a lot easier for the royal family. I really hated the twist with the movie's villain. It was obvious that it was tacked on last minute.I do like Anna and Elsa a lot. They're both great princesses in their own right. On the other hand, they do make stupid decisions that make no sense. One example is Elsa just running away from her problems and singing about how she doesn't care about what others think and acts like an idiot when Anna comes to see her in the ice castle that she created. Also, Anna stupidly decides to marry a prince that she barely knows. Despite their stupid decisions, I still like the two sisters along with Olaf the snowman.The movie has beautiful animation like Tangled. It also has some great songs like Do You Want to Build a Snowman, For the First Time in Forever, and of course, Let It Go. Other songs should have been cut out like Fixer Upper because they add nothing to the story. I can't see how Frozen is anything like the movies from the Disney Renaissance era. It's good, but not that good. For a kid like me who grew up during the 1990's, it's hard to top movies like Aladdin, Lion King, and Mulan. Despite its flaws, I will still recommend Frozen to others.","['big', 'disney', 'fan', 'since', 'little', 'girl', 'sadly', 'see', 'frozen', 'theater', 'main', 'reason', 'really', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'advertisement', 'movie', 'hearing', 'frozen', 'get', 'review', 'amaze', 'bought', 'blu', 'ray', 'dvd', 'digital', 'copy', 'combo', 'pack', 'april', 'last', 'year', 'watch', 'movie', 'thought', 'frozen', 'decent', 'entry', 'disney', 'library', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'storyline', 'part', 'far', 'fetch', 'like', 'parent', 'handle', 'elsa', 'power', 'accident', 'separate', 'two', 'sister', 'isolate', 'elsa', 'cause', 'power', 'get', 'hand', 'time', 'least', 'anna', 'elsa', 'turn', 'fine', 'decade', 'barely', 'see', 'addition', 'grand', 'pappie', 'rock', 'troll', 'ridiculous', 'rock', 'troll', 'add', 'nothing', 'story', 'also', 'could', 'explain', 'handle', 'elsa', 'power', 'well', 'would', 'make', 'thing', 'lot', 'easy', 'royal', 'family', 'really', 'hat', 'twist', 'movie', 'villain', 'obvious', 'tacked', 'last', 'minute', 'like', 'anna', 'elsa', 'lot', 'great', 'princess', 'right', 'hand', 'make', 'stupid', 'decision', 'make', 'sense', 'one', 'example', 'elsa', 'run', 'away', 'problem', 'sing', 'care', 'others', 'think', 'act', 'like', 'idiot', 'anna', 'come', 'see', 'ice', 'castle', 'create', 'also', 'anna', 'stupidly', 'decides', 'marry', 'prince', 'barely', 'know', 'despite', 'stupid', 'decision', 'still', 'like', 'two', 'sister', 'along', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'like', 'tangle', 'also', 'great', 'song', 'like', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'course', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'cut', 'like', 'fixer', 'upper', 'add', 'nothing', 'story', 'see', 'frozen', 'anything', 'like', 'movie', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'era', 'good', 'good', 'kid', 'like', 'grow', 'hard', 'top', 'movie', 'like', 'aladdin', 'lion', 'king', 'mulan', 'despite', 'flaw', 'still', 'recommend', 'frozen', 'others']","[106, 2, 176, 98, 48, 76, 1670, 16, 5, 312, 119, 180, 22, 963, 31, 541, 4227, 1, 995, 5, 19, 161, 96, 1863, 1081, 1030, 540, 1572, 2411, 4228, 2161, 197, 47, 23, 1, 92, 5, 546, 1889, 2, 2366, 119, 198, 1, 295, 94, 142, 3503, 9, 118, 1036, 4, 24, 480, 786, 42, 15, 1438, 4, 328, 24, 19, 323, 20, 250, 7, 4, 113, 470, 492, 944, 16, 1000, 936, 834, 123, 1195, 834, 123, 269, 156, 12, 27, 54, 400, 1036, 4, 24, 18, 26, 14, 43, 84, 454, 870, 72, 22, 606, 129, 1, 104, 595, 2584, 197, 211, 9, 7, 4, 84, 25, 29, 130, 323, 14, 494, 758, 14, 217, 10, 396, 4, 233, 101, 198, 63, 293, 247, 37, 112, 9, 2022, 7, 40, 16, 33, 168, 134, 27, 7, 3504, 996, 390, 82, 944, 56, 313, 494, 758, 68, 9, 42, 15, 172, 32, 45, 1, 93, 21, 9, 83, 27, 25, 11, 9, 59, 202, 45, 36, 20, 287, 228, 30, 13, 11, 723, 9, 772, 737, 269, 156, 12, 16, 5, 212, 9, 1, 2, 465, 942, 17, 17, 60, 9, 285, 307, 239, 1, 9, 485, 152, 97, 931, 313, 386, 68, 262, 5, 247]"
128,10,"Well, at first I thought this movie wasn't going to be that great. But on one fateful day, I heard the infamous song :Let It Go"". After I heard the song, I knew that I had to see the movie. For those who have not seen the movie, I highly recommend it. Not only because it is one of the best Disney movies ever, but because of the morals in the story. This is the first Disney movie that I don't get tired of, simply because of the morals in it. But for starters, this is the first Disney movie to EVER prove that you can't marry someone you just met. Some will use you for their own benefits, and use your own emotions against you. Love. Many of Disney's movies have stuck to the act of true love being a kiss from a guy or girl. But this movie shows that the strongest love, is in family. And their are a couple of extra bits about love. Love is putting someone else's needs before yours, and the infamous quote from and infamous character: ""Some people are worth melting for"". Enough said. Watch this movie. Not only is it the BEST Disney movie ever, but it teaches great and amazing life lessons and morals. And believe me, once you see this movie, you'll never Let It Go.","['well', 'first', 'thought', 'movie', 'go', 'great', 'one', 'fateful', 'day', 'heard', 'infamous', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'heard', 'song', 'knew', 'see', 'movie', 'see', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'moral', 'story', 'first', 'disney', 'movie', 'get', 'tire', 'simply', 'moral', 'starter', 'first', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'prove', 'marry', 'someone', 'met', 'use', 'benefit', 'use', 'emotion', 'love', 'many', 'disney', 'movie', 'stuck', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'guy', 'girl', 'movie', 'show', 'strong', 'love', 'family', 'couple', 'extra', 'bit', 'love', 'love', 'put', 'someone', 'else', 'need', 'infamous', 'quote', 'infamous', 'character', 'people', 'worth', 'melt', 'enough', 'say', 'watch', 'movie', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'teach', 'great', 'amaze', 'life', 'lesson', 'moral', 'believe', 'see', 'movie', 'never', 'let', 'go']","[18, 36, 92, 1, 13, 25, 10, 3505, 138, 357, 2412, 11, 30, 13, 357, 11, 488, 16, 1, 16, 1, 472, 262, 10, 34, 2, 1, 81, 551, 12, 36, 2, 1, 19, 1086, 341, 551, 4229, 36, 2, 1, 81, 799, 390, 304, 392, 158, 1711, 158, 240, 6, 61, 2, 1, 954, 112, 62, 6, 372, 148, 76, 1, 78, 167, 6, 72, 398, 1237, 95, 6, 6, 196, 304, 270, 99, 2412, 1774, 2412, 8, 46, 254, 359, 164, 35, 23, 1, 34, 2, 1, 81, 621, 25, 96, 79, 499, 551, 220, 16, 1, 88, 30, 13]"
129,10,"I loved most everything about this movie...and what I didn't love, was more than made up for by what I did.CGI: Stunning. Left me feeling awestruck with what they could do with Elsa's ice powers. The animators did such a wonderful job of balancing realism with the imaginative to create a near-perfect visually stunning movie.MUSIC and VOCALS: Loved how musical this movie was. Now, not every song was a grand slam for me, but there were more than enough to keep my mind occupied for hours. Let it Go, First Time in Forever (especially the reprise), Let it Go, Do You Wanna Build a Snowman, Let it Go, Love is an Open Door, Let it Go, Fixer-upper...loved all of these songs. Idina was as amazing as usual with her vocals. I had no idea that Kristen Bell had such a strong Broadway resume and such great chops. Thoroughly surprised and impressed.HUMOR: This was a bit of a mixed bag for me. Anna made me laugh A LOT in this movie, as did Christophe (sp?). The trolls and Olaf weren't my favorite comic-relief characters, but they weren't annoying. The humor in the songs was awesome ""finish each others' sandwiches""...too funny.CHARACTERS: I thought the characters were great. I loved what they did with the two princesses with one being the clumsy, down to earth, speaks before she thinks type person, and the other being more ""proper"", but absolutely fierce from a personality strength standpoint. I liked the male characters well enough...like others have mentioned, there's no Flynn Rider in this movie, but they aren't bad. It was really nice in this movie to see very strong female characters without some of the over-the-top feisty characters of prior Disney movies like Brave, Aladdin, etc. No defiance necessary in this one.STORY: Perfect. So different than just about any other Disney princess movie created. The romance was cute and warm, but the absolutely unconditional sisterly love was a real breath of fresh air. It was really touching. I liked the twists quite a bit, and they did catch me off guard.Disney MAGIC FACTOR: Very high. This movie elicits such a sense of wonder, fascination, warmth, humor...the list goes on. You leave the theater kind of walking on a cloud, not unlike leaving the Magic Kingdom.Loved this movie, and can't wait to see it again.","['love', 'everything', 'movie', 'love', 'make', 'cgi', 'stun', 'left', 'feel', 'awestruck', 'could', 'elsa', 'ice', 'power', 'animator', 'wonderful', 'job', 'balance', 'realism', 'imaginative', 'create', 'near', 'perfect', 'visually', 'stun', 'movie', 'music', 'vocal', 'love', 'musical', 'movie', 'every', 'song', 'grand', 'slam', 'enough', 'keep', 'mind', 'occupy', 'hour', 'let', 'go', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'especially', 'reprise', 'let', 'go', 'wan', 'build', 'snowman', 'let', 'go', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'let', 'go', 'fixer', 'upper', 'love', 'song', 'idina', 'amaze', 'usual', 'vocal', 'idea', 'kristen', 'bell', 'strong', 'broadway', 'resume', 'great', 'chop', 'thoroughly', 'surprised', 'impressed', 'humor', 'bit', 'mixed', 'bag', 'anna', 'make', 'laugh', 'lot', 'movie', 'christophe', 'sp', 'troll', 'olaf', 'favorite', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'annoy', 'humor', 'song', 'awesome', 'finish', 'others', 'sandwich', 'funny', 'character', 'thought', 'character', 'great', 'love', 'two', 'princess', 'one', 'clumsy', 'earth', 'speaks', 'think', 'type', 'person', 'proper', 'absolutely', 'fierce', 'personality', 'strength', 'standpoint', 'like', 'male', 'character', 'well', 'enough', 'like', 'others', 'mention', 'flynn', 'rider', 'movie', 'bad', 'really', 'nice', 'movie', 'see', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'without', 'top', 'feisty', 'character', 'prior', 'disney', 'movie', 'like', 'brave', 'aladdin', 'etc', 'defiance', 'necessary', 'one', 'story', 'perfect', 'different', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'create', 'romance', 'cute', 'warm', 'absolutely', 'unconditional', 'sisterly', 'love', 'real', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'really', 'touch', 'like', 'twist', 'quite', 'bit', 'catch', 'guard', 'disney', 'magic', 'factor', 'high', 'movie', 'elicits', 'sense', 'wonder', 'fascination', 'warmth', 'humor', 'list', 'go', 'leave', 'theater', 'kind', 'walk', 'cloud', 'unlike', 'leave', 'magic', 'kingdom', 'love', 'movie', 'wait', 'see']","[6, 132, 1, 6, 14, 555, 315, 330, 53, 4230, 54, 4, 33, 24, 812, 215, 373, 677, 2193, 2194, 134, 449, 175, 585, 315, 1, 58, 821, 6, 51, 1, 115, 11, 936, 3051, 164, 154, 320, 3010, 487, 30, 13, 36, 20, 287, 121, 1775, 30, 13, 779, 202, 45, 30, 13, 6, 318, 478, 30, 13, 772, 737, 6, 11, 141, 96, 562, 821, 281, 162, 146, 167, 411, 3404, 25, 4231, 1243, 703, 947, 222, 95, 1082, 3052, 7, 14, 190, 84, 1, 1357, 123, 32, 189, 309, 297, 8, 238, 222, 11, 338, 855, 247, 3053, 85, 8, 92, 8, 25, 6, 42, 29, 10, 1262, 1776, 3506, 37, 524, 441, 2195, 292, 3507, 407, 887, 2112, 9, 431, 8, 18, 164, 9, 247, 348, 1322, 3054, 1, 65, 22, 192, 1, 16, 167, 237, 8, 137, 239, 1651, 8, 1883, 2, 1, 9, 335, 485, 430, 1496, 10, 12, 175, 140, 2, 29, 1, 134, 363, 265, 362, 292, 4232, 711, 6, 195, 990, 819, 1323, 22, 260, 9, 129, 124, 95, 1321, 1708, 2, 150, 945, 206, 1, 217, 532, 4233, 1324, 222, 550, 13, 322, 312, 193, 669, 1777, 766, 322, 150, 77, 6, 1, 415, 16]"

Olaf has become very popular among the adults who've seen the film as well.Myself have not liked many of the Disney animated films over the years, but this is a stand-out hit among all genders and ages.

131,9,"I've always been very impressed by animated films, I think they're generally of a very high standard. There is a strange apprehension that many adults seem to have about them; that they're silly, just for kids. It's completely irrational. I think animation is actually the ""genre"" with the highest consistent standard. They almost always have far more detail than live-action entertainment. Everything you see was specifically put there, it was built from scratch. Nowadays it's possible to get lazy with the use of computers, but with the right attitude, CGI only opens up more possibilities. It also allows for more exaggeration and symbolism; you aren't limited to the reality everyone is used to. You can set up your own rules which is far more refreshing and exciting.The characters are very strong and human in Frozen, especially Ana. She loves her sister Elsa and just wants to play with her all the time. She loves her so much that it hurts every time she's turned down and yet she is still just as excited to play with her the next time. There is a lot of physical comedy with Ana. She is very energetic and positive and careless. We see her heart and her insecurities, she is very likable.The story is quite adult in some ways. Many families will experience some kind of strain or separation, whether temporary or permanent. Each side has their own point of view and are often trying to do the right thing; it's complicated. People get hurt, years pass and there is anger and guilt and regret. And hopefully, there is still love.The characters we meet are all interesting and quirky. We get a good feel for their personality from the get-go. There are twists that may teach kids to think twice about first impressions. Elsa isn't evil but is conflicted and dangerous which is a nice change from typical villains in movies. The action scenes are done really well. There are only a few parts that are a bit weaker or predictable (the troll song seems unnecessary). The voice-acting is fun and varied, they say lines in interesting ways that bring out more meaning.Olaf is very funny and offbeat. He fills in a familiar position in these kinds of movies but his timing and manner is unique. You aren't quite sure what he's going to say but it's generally very funny. He makes matter-of-fact observations halfway between obvious and profound.Although the music is very nice, I think the transitions were too forced and artificial. A bit too perfect. The songs fall too conveniently into standard show-stopping number formats. Reminds me of Wicked and Glee - let's all stop and sing loudly and proudly and colourfully with shining lights on us. It should be natural, an emotional expression of the character's feelings and desires. Not a show-off piece of pop music with ""hilarious"" lines thrown in. Still, the songs are very good and sometimes funny. But there could be more of a common thread or style running through them and more originality or boldness.It's unfair and naive that the world seems to look down at ""kid's movies"" (any genre other than drama apparently deserves no respect). If anything, they usually achieve more than other films. They manage to move us, make us laugh or sing or smile or cry. They do this without swearing or being excessively violent or sexual (easy ways to affect people or to be ""ground-breaking""). They draw us in with simple, beautiful stories and characters. All made possible by the tremendous amount of talent, passion and hard-work going on behind the scenes.","['always', 'impressed', 'animate', 'film', 'think', 'generally', 'high', 'standard', 'strange', 'apprehension', 'many', 'adult', 'seem', 'silly', 'kid', 'completely', 'irrational', 'think', 'animation', 'actually', 'genre', 'high', 'consistent', 'standard', 'almost', 'always', 'far', 'detail', 'live', 'action', 'entertainment', 'everything', 'see', 'specifically', 'put', 'built', 'scratch', 'nowadays', 'possible', 'get', 'lazy', 'use', 'computer', 'right', 'attitude', 'cgi', 'open', 'possibility', 'also', 'allows', 'exaggeration', 'symbolism', 'limited', 'reality', 'everyone', 'use', 'set', 'rule', 'far', 'refresh', 'excite', 'character', 'strong', 'human', 'frozen', 'especially', 'ana', 'love', 'sister', 'elsa', 'want', 'play', 'time', 'love', 'much', 'hurt', 'every', 'time', 'turn', 'yet', 'still', 'excite', 'play', 'next', 'time', 'lot', 'physical', 'comedy', 'ana', 'energetic', 'positive', 'careless', 'see', 'heart', 'insecurity', 'likable', 'story', 'quite', 'adult', 'way', 'many', 'family', 'experience', 'kind', 'strain', 'separation', 'whether', 'temporary', 'permanent', 'side', 'point', 'view', 'often', 'try', 'right', 'thing', 'complicate', 'people', 'get', 'hurt', 'year', 'pas', 'anger', 'guilt', 'regret', 'hopefully', 'still', 'love', 'character', 'meet', 'interest', 'quirky', 'get', 'good', 'feel', 'personality', 'get', 'go', 'twist', 'may', 'teach', 'kid', 'think', 'twice', 'first', 'impression', 'elsa', 'evil', 'conflict', 'dangerous', 'nice', 'change', 'typical', 'villain', 'movie', 'action', 'scene', 'really', 'well', 'part', 'bit', 'weaker', 'predictable', 'troll', 'song', 'seem', 'unnecessary', 'voice', 'act', 'fun', 'varied', 'say', 'line', 'interest', 'way', 'bring', 'meaning', 'olaf', 'funny', 'offbeat', 'fill', 'familiar', 'position', 'kind', 'movie', 'timing', 'manner', 'unique', 'quite', 'sure', 'go', 'say', 'generally', 'funny', 'make', 'matter', 'fact', 'observation', 'halfway', 'obvious', 'profound', 'although', 'music', 'nice', 'think', 'transition', 'force', 'artificial', 'bit', 'perfect', 'song', 'fall', 'conveniently', 'standard', 'show', 'stop', 'number', 'format', 'reminds', 'wicked', 'glee', 'let', 'stop', 'sing', 'loudly', 'proudly', 'colourfully', 'shin', 'light', 'u', 'natural', 'emotional', 'expression', 'character', 'feeling', 'desire', 'show', 'piece', 'pop', 'music', 'hilarious', 'line', 'thrown', 'still', 'song', 'good', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'could', 'common', 'thread', 'style', 'run', 'originality', 'boldness', 'unfair', 'naive', 'world', 'seem', 'look', 'kid', 'movie', 'genre', 'drama', 'apparently', 'deserves', 'respect', 'anything', 'usually', 'achieve', 'film', 'manage', 'move', 'u', 'make', 'u', 'laugh', 'sing', 'smile', 'cry', 'without', 'swear', 'excessively', 'violent', 'sexual', 'easy', 'way', 'affect', 'people', 'ground', 'break', 'draw', 'u', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'story', 'character', 'make', 'possible', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'talent', 'passion', 'hard', 'work', 'go', 'behind', 'scene']","[163, 947, 38, 3, 37, 1004, 206, 633, 980, 61, 147, 75, 847, 60, 291, 4235, 37, 21, 103, 768, 206, 2169, 633, 173, 163, 142, 468, 224, 345, 839, 132, 16, 1828, 196, 787, 3446, 1475, 673, 19, 1373, 158, 642, 130, 1536, 555, 318, 2123, 27, 1671, 4236, 2675, 1576, 940, 109, 158, 144, 788, 142, 1010, 447, 8, 167, 515, 5, 121, 929, 6, 15, 4, 59, 204, 20, 6, 31, 305, 115, 20, 113, 182, 68, 447, 204, 418, 20, 84, 1873, 279, 929, 2172, 503, 4237, 16, 80, 2681, 402, 12, 124, 147, 50, 61, 72, 334, 193, 2033, 2196, 638, 3508, 3509, 387, 117, 413, 583, 87, 130, 43, 979, 46, 19, 305, 47, 1204, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1309, 68, 6, 8, 244, 122, 908, 19, 17, 53, 407, 19, 13, 129, 171, 621, 60, 37, 1227, 36, 1118, 4, 277, 552, 702, 192, 209, 376, 104, 1, 345, 90, 22, 18, 94, 95, 2413, 331, 123, 11, 75, 845, 86, 112, 125, 3510, 35, 213, 122, 50, 221, 672, 32, 85, 481, 1077, 1391, 193, 1, 1861, 1377, 414, 124, 207, 13, 35, 1004, 85, 14, 375, 201, 4238, 1612, 595, 1823, 255, 58, 192, 37, 1740, 272, 3055, 95, 175, 11, 186, 4239, 633, 78, 284, 184, 1778, 1044, 678, 1548, 30, 284, 63, 3365, 4240, 2034, 735, 177, 1660, 342, 1069, 8, 680, 1070, 78, 588, 658, 58, 364, 213, 1121, 68, 11, 17, 504, 85, 54, 999, 2197, 355, 233, 1378, 4241, 1144, 126, 75, 66, 60, 1, 768, 745, 755, 592, 1311, 212, 460, 1531, 3, 857, 242, 177, 14, 177, 190, 63, 914, 505, 137, 3056, 4242, 2682, 2414, 454, 50, 1076, 46, 1051, 340, 1128, 177, 516, 93, 12, 8, 14, 673, 1869, 624, 800, 2415, 307, 107, 13, 750, 90]"

The story is simple, but it is an excellent one. The film is great for people of all ages. Children will get the delight of a talking snowman and adults will be enthralled by the mature themes the movie present. As for the music, it can't get any better than this. ""Let it Go"" is the most catchy and wonderful song. It's one that will be stuck in my head.Chris Buck's and Jennifer Lee's film is about a princess named Anna who takes a trip with a mountain boy and his reindeer in order to find her sister, the Queen Elsa who has magical powers in the form of turning everything to ice. She must find Elsa before the kingdom falls to corruption.The film has a nice voice cast. Kristen Bell delivers a fun, youthful performance as Princess Anna. Is Idina Menzel ever talented! She was excellent as Queen Elsa and when she belted her rendition of Let it Go, my heart just stopped. We also have some good supporting turns in Josh Gad and Ciaran Hinds.Overall, Frozen is one of the best Disney Animation films of this century and certainly rivals the best of the very best. The songs are excellent and worth singing along to, the animation is crystal clear, and above all, there is a story that is worth telling. A story about true love and how even magical, icy powers won't keep true love away. This is a delight for both kids and adults alike. I fell in love with this film and I clamor for a sequel, a good one though.

Because I was expecting greatness on the level of Disney classics. I was trying to see how this film was on par with ""Beauty and The Beast""It's not... But, on giving it a second chance a while later, I found myself loving it!Why? Because of the amazing music and entertainment value. However, it's only entertaining from a scene to scene point of view. As a whole the story is full of plot holes and baffling ideas (Read any negative review for more detail). Whole important plot points are shown only to be never spoken of. Also the secondary characters are never really developed enough for us to understand their motivations. (e.g. Why the heck is Kristoff a ice seller raised by Trolls and not the ice sellers in the first scene?)The film does work. But, it really shouldn't from a storytelling standpoint.What makes Frozen a good film is the beautiful world, amazing music, fun characters! Most importantly the excitement of each scene prevents the viewer from ever having the chance to really dwell on these story problems long enough.That being said. The lack of a flow/ connection between some scenes is what prevents it from being a modern ""Beauty and The Beast"". Go in expecting something a little less satisfying then How to Train Your Dragon and you'll enjoy it.","['disney', 'best', 'last', 'year', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'definitely', 'superior', 'say', 'enjoyable', 'worth', 'watch', 'music', 'fun', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'however', 'go', 'expect', 'modern', 'beauty', 'beast', 'aladdin', 'promise', 'want', 'shut', 'film', 'seriously', 'music', 'story', 'fun', 'level', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'aladdin', 'etc', 'shut', 'movie', 'disgust', 'first', 'time', 'min', 'expect', 'greatness', 'level', 'disney', 'classic', 'try', 'see', 'film', 'par', 'beauty', 'beast', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'later', 'found', 'love', 'amaze', 'music', 'entertainment', 'value', 'however', 'entertain', 'scene', 'scene', 'point', 'view', 'whole', 'story', 'full', 'plot', 'hole', 'baffling', 'idea', 'read', 'negative', 'review', 'detail', 'whole', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'show', 'never', 'spoken', 'also', 'secondary', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'developed', 'enough', 'u', 'understand', 'motivation', 'e', 'g', 'heck', 'kristoff', 'ice', 'seller', 'raise', 'troll', 'ice', 'seller', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'work', 'really', 'storytelling', 'standpoint', 'make', 'frozen', 'good', 'film', 'beautiful', 'world', 'amaze', 'music', 'fun', 'character', 'importantly', 'excitement', 'scene', 'prevents', 'viewer', 'ever', 'chance', 'really', 'dwell', 'story', 'problem', 'long', 'enough', 'say', 'lack', 'flow', 'connection', 'scene', 'prevents', 'modern', 'beauty', 'beast', 'go', 'expect', 'something', 'little', 'less', 'satisfy', 'train', 'dragon', 'enjoy']","[2, 34, 197, 47, 83, 352, 379, 174, 1185, 35, 306, 254, 23, 58, 125, 12, 136, 17, 110, 13, 131, 324, 149, 203, 485, 1499, 59, 686, 3, 667, 58, 12, 125, 440, 149, 203, 152, 97, 485, 430, 686, 1, 1733, 36, 20, 1624, 131, 2198, 440, 2, 69, 87, 16, 3, 1028, 149, 203, 57, 319, 632, 358, 231, 6, 96, 58, 839, 728, 110, 243, 90, 90, 117, 413, 127, 12, 246, 52, 697, 2619, 281, 547, 761, 161, 468, 127, 289, 52, 117, 78, 88, 1903, 27, 1665, 8, 88, 22, 610, 164, 177, 216, 2035, 893, 1986, 1325, 67, 33, 2199, 760, 123, 33, 2199, 36, 90, 3, 107, 22, 689, 2112, 14, 5, 17, 3, 93, 126, 96, 58, 125, 8, 1398, 1871, 90, 3057, 479, 81, 632, 22, 4245, 12, 198, 169, 164, 35, 273, 1183, 1189, 90, 3057, 324, 149, 203, 13, 131, 89, 48, 321, 1188, 1124, 1412, 91]"
140,7,"Coming fresh off Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph, Disney finally feel like they're redeeming themselves after the kid 'friendly' misfires of the 2000s. As they embrace 3D animation, now they feel relevant, charmingly idiosyncratic and built on a much grander scale. They're back to being event cinema. While Wreck-It Ralph is starting to feel like a one-off stroke of genius, Frozen feels more like the sister-film to Tangled, of which was a great pleasant surprise for its laid-back attitude and sharp sense of humour, while Frozen relies on a more urgent tension, it retains that humour and a similar emotional release. Fortunately it has stronger and more confident use of songs which is a tradition sorely missed from Disney. However, in taking the typical mold of adapting an old folktale, it results in quite predictable storytelling and character archetypes. Pleasant, but predictable.It has a few pacing problems in the beginning too, I wish it was more like Tangled in that regard which set us up quickly whereas Frozen spends its first half hour rushing through it rather than settling us in. It's a frequent issue with the film that's a double-edged sword. For example, as the deadpan snowman Olaf steals the show in the second half, he feels like he came from the highlight reel of a completely different writer. While this may give something for everyone and each shard of content is really good, there's something about them that doesn't quite gel. However, Frozen hinges on its lead and Disney has nailed the quirky but feisty young female protagonist where other animation departments struggle. It's great to see a film like this concerned with sisterhood and it hits some really powerful beats. While its path may be jagged and unusual, Frozen is still utterly refreshing and a joy to watch.7/10","['come', 'fresh', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'disney', 'finally', 'feel', 'like', 'redeem', 'kid', 'friendly', 'misfire', 'embrace', 'animation', 'feel', 'relevant', 'charmingly', 'idiosyncratic', 'built', 'much', 'grander', 'scale', 'back', 'event', 'cinema', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'start', 'feel', 'like', 'one', 'stroke', 'genius', 'frozen', 'feel', 'like', 'sister', 'film', 'tangle', 'great', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'laid', 'back', 'attitude', 'sharp', 'sense', 'humour', 'frozen', 'relies', 'urgent', 'tension', 'retains', 'humour', 'similar', 'emotional', 'release', 'fortunately', 'strong', 'confident', 'use', 'song', 'tradition', 'sorely', 'miss', 'disney', 'however', 'take', 'typical', 'mold', 'adapt', 'old', 'folktale', 'result', 'quite', 'predictable', 'storytelling', 'character', 'archetype', 'pleasant', 'predictable', 'pace', 'problem', 'begin', 'wish', 'like', 'tangle', 'regard', 'set', 'u', 'quickly', 'whereas', 'frozen', 'spends', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'rush', 'rather', 'settle', 'u', 'frequent', 'issue', 'film', 'double', 'edge', 'sword', 'example', 'deadpan', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'steal', 'show', 'second', 'half', 'feel', 'like', 'come', 'highlight', 'reel', 'completely', 'different', 'writer', 'may', 'give', 'something', 'everyone', 'shard', 'content', 'really', 'good', 'something', 'quite', 'gel', 'however', 'frozen', 'hinge', 'lead', 'disney', 'nail', 'quirky', 'feisty', 'young', 'female', 'protagonist', 'animation', 'department', 'struggle', 'great', 'see', 'film', 'like', 'concerned', 'sisterhood', 'hit', 'really', 'powerful', 'beat', 'path', 'may', 'jagged', 'unusual', 'frozen', 'still', 'utterly', 'refresh', 'joy', 'watch']","[40, 819, 83, 352, 379, 2, 241, 53, 9, 1199, 60, 837, 3494, 1221, 21, 53, 1335, 3421, 787, 31, 4246, 1827, 74, 618, 543, 352, 379, 120, 53, 9, 10, 4247, 2036, 5, 53, 9, 15, 3, 83, 25, 978, 445, 3515, 74, 1536, 2556, 217, 732, 5, 2596, 1214, 4248, 732, 446, 342, 288, 2192, 167, 2686, 158, 11, 1071, 4249, 271, 2, 110, 55, 376, 2308, 912, 64, 648, 124, 331, 689, 8, 2417, 978, 331, 564, 198, 160, 417, 9, 83, 902, 144, 177, 733, 1565, 5, 1673, 36, 346, 487, 525, 191, 2037, 177, 519, 3, 2177, 1068, 1277, 396, 45, 32, 906, 78, 319, 346, 53, 9, 40, 1358, 291, 140, 605, 171, 57, 89, 109, 3516, 1370, 22, 17, 89, 124, 4250, 110, 5, 4251, 248, 2, 2418, 908, 1651, 73, 237, 354, 21, 1755, 639, 25, 16, 3, 9, 2200, 861, 234, 22, 439, 1167, 1347, 171, 4252, 2419, 5, 68, 1209, 1010, 738, 23]"
141,10,"This Walt Disney movie is an enchanting musical extravaganza which captures the attention of the audience right until the end. The story line is centered around a Princess, Elsa who is born with magical powers. Unable to control her mystic abilities, she flees to the snowy mountains to live in solitude. Her younger sibling, Anna along with mountain man Kristoff make attempts to save her, but to no avail. Thereafter, an interesting turn of events lead Elsa to return to save the Kingdom from despair.The technology used in this movie is undoubtedly 'state-of-the-art', which coupled with melodic music and brilliant dialogues make it one of the best animated movies to date. Each character is given ample screen time and have been excellently portrayed. The scenes with snow covered castles and landscapes are breathtaking and leaves the viewers hungry for more. An unexpected and innovative twist at the very end lightens up the mood. A simple and linear story line ensures people of all age groups are able to understand and appreciate the essence that the movie imparts.The movie also encourages its viewers to realize the difference between Infatuation and True Love, which in practicality is misconceived by many. All in all, 'Frozen' is a must watch for everyone.

149,4,"Frozen is a mystery to me. How an average run-of-the-mill Disney film has become a sensation for a year and a half has puzzled me. I feel this film pales in comparison to Snow White, Bambi, Fantasia, Beauty & The Beast, Toy Story and other animated/CGI films often lauded as the best from The House Of The Mouse. I sat through the film twice, looked for hidden meanings (and found none) and tried to understand what was going on and just didn't understand the hype or why people are ridiculously obsessed with the film, its songs or its characters. Was it because of the cold winters the last two years, the standout track Let It Go (honestly, a pretty good song) or the done-to-death oppression theme? Why are so many people crazy about this film? It's a mystery to me.Frozen has top of the line CGI and one good song but nothing more. The script is painfully lame and isn't worthy of a PG rating, the voice acting is hammy, the characters are annoying to anybody who isn't a tween girl (Disney's biggest audience by far) and it's simply not like Disney films of the past that could appeal to all ages. Only tween girls will find Frozen a joy. Everybody else should just see it as another Bob Iger cash grab but strangely, they don't. They are mesmerized by this mediocre film for reasons I'll never know.

150,5,"Unpopular opinion alert: Frozen is neither original, uplifting or musically inclined and is a derivative attempt to revitalize the Disney name.Archon understands Walt Disney Animations has been in a slump, chronically in the shadow of the magnificent and innovative Pixar Studios – but that is no excuse to elevate an average animated film to superstardom – our argument for the hoopla of Frozen.Based on Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Snow Queen"", Frozen tells the fateful tale of the kingdom of Arendelle. Elsa and Anna, princesses of Arendelle, were once happy children until Elsa, burdened and blessed with the mystical power to conjure ice and snow with her touch, accidentally nearly killed her sister. Elsa's fear of her powers causes her to distance herself from her sister until the crown is passed on to her. Forced into the spotlight and still unable to control her powers, she accidentally encases her kingdom in ice and thrusts it into an infinite winter. Anna and her new found friends Olaf and Kristoff race to save her sister and Arendelle from a blistery fate.Frozen is not a bad animated film, and on the scope of Disney films of recent times its damn near perfect. Do not let lowered expectations and hopefulness deceive you, Frozen is not fantastic nor comparable to the legendary counterparts along the likes of The Lion King, Beauty & the Beast, The Little Mermaid and others.As a Disney animated film, we were completely on board with the film up and to the point of the musical number ""Do You Want to Build a Snow Man?"" The story was progressing quickly, the characters were unique and starting to take shape and the film's inner light was starting to show. What followed can only be called a medley of unnecessary musical numbers, followed by irritating and simplistic supporting characters and a weak core conflict, antagonist and resolution. Frozen tries to tote the testament of love, family, sisterhood but reverts to a holey plot and poor character and plot development. As a narrative and a film, it is not fully formed and relies on the Disney name and stellar vocal abilities of the actors involved.It is very clear from the film that Frozen will be a hit with the youngsters but it just doesn't have that spark of its predecessors to stand the test of time. As some films literally continue to be beloved for over fifty years in some cases. As quickly as it catches on, Frozen will burn out and fade away in adoration with the addition of the next ""It"" feature film.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.","['unpopular', 'opinion', 'alert', 'frozen', 'neither', 'original', 'uplift', 'musically', 'inclined', 'derivative', 'attempt', 'revitalize', 'disney', 'name', 'archon', 'understands', 'walt', 'disney', 'animation', 'slump', 'chronically', 'shadow', 'magnificent', 'innovative', 'pixar', 'studio', 'excuse', 'elevate', 'average', 'animate', 'film', 'superstardom', 'argument', 'hoopla', 'frozen', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'frozen', 'tell', 'fateful', 'tale', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'elsa', 'anna', 'princess', 'arendelle', 'happy', 'child', 'elsa', 'burden', 'bless', 'mystical', 'power', 'conjure', 'ice', 'snow', 'touch', 'accidentally', 'nearly', 'kill', 'sister', 'elsa', 'fear', 'power', 'cause', 'distance', 'sister', 'crown', 'pass', 'force', 'spotlight', 'still', 'unable', 'control', 'power', 'accidentally', 'encases', 'kingdom', 'ice', 'thrust', 'infinite', 'winter', 'anna', 'new', 'found', 'friend', 'olaf', 'kristoff', 'race', 'save', 'sister', 'arendelle', 'blistery', 'fate', 'frozen', 'bad', 'animate', 'film', 'scope', 'disney', 'film', 'recent', 'time', 'damn', 'near', 'perfect', 'let', 'lower', 'expectation', 'hopefulness', 'deceive', 'frozen', 'fantastic', 'comparable', 'legendary', 'counterpart', 'along', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'beauty', 'beast', 'little', 'mermaid', 'others', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'completely', 'board', 'film', 'point', 'musical', 'number', 'want', 'build', 'snow', 'man', 'story', 'progress', 'quickly', 'character', 'unique', 'start', 'take', 'shape', 'film', 'inner', 'light', 'start', 'show', 'follow', 'call', 'medley', 'unnecessary', 'musical', 'number', 'follow', 'irritate', 'simplistic', 'support', 'character', 'weak', 'core', 'conflict', 'antagonist', 'resolution', 'frozen', 'try', 'tote', 'testament', 'love', 'family', 'sisterhood', 'reverts', 'holey', 'plot', 'poor', 'character', 'plot', 'development', 'narrative', 'film', 'fully', 'form', 'relies', 'disney', 'name', 'stellar', 'vocal', 'ability', 'actor', 'involve', 'clear', 'film', 'frozen', 'hit', 'youngster', 'spark', 'predecessor', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'film', 'literally', 'continue', 'beloved', 'fifty', 'year', 'case', 'quickly', 'catch', 'frozen', 'burn', 'fade', 'away', 'adoration', 'addition', 'next', 'feature', 'film', 'please', 'check', 'website', 'full', 'review', 'recent', 'release']","[2597, 258, 1741, 5, 1197, 230, 1955, 1769, 2609, 3492, 448, 4260, 2, 183, 2696, 410, 2, 21, 3533, 2350, 935, 1831, 194, 311, 1229, 3067, 921, 38, 3, 1375, 5, 256, 44, 245, 467, 39, 49, 5, 143, 3505, 114, 77, 199, 4, 7, 29, 199, 301, 70, 4, 3068, 2423, 1542, 24, 2156, 33, 39, 260, 300, 501, 286, 15, 4, 187, 24, 328, 1486, 15, 722, 1122, 272, 2042, 68, 1178, 128, 24, 300, 77, 33, 2424, 2425, 105, 7, 108, 231, 327, 32, 67, 1224, 111, 15, 199, 1648, 5, 65, 38, 3, 2697, 2, 3, 399, 20, 1480, 449, 175, 30, 4071, 452, 2206, 5, 253, 3534, 2426, 3069, 172, 9, 152, 97, 149, 203, 48, 422, 247, 2, 38, 3, 291, 2698, 3, 117, 51, 184, 59, 202, 39, 145, 12, 1149, 733, 8, 414, 120, 55, 1317, 3, 1154, 735, 120, 78, 378, 308, 845, 51, 184, 378, 1352, 1556, 740, 8, 434, 1399, 552, 634, 1098, 5, 87, 3535, 6, 72, 861, 52, 973, 8, 52, 356, 802, 3, 822, 427, 2596, 2, 183, 2207, 821, 367, 518, 584, 871, 3, 5, 234, 2347, 2699, 2693, 361, 1279, 20, 3, 643, 647, 1280, 4234, 47, 514, 733, 1321, 5, 2700, 3536, 101, 4140, 1000, 418, 229, 3, 576, 1310, 1960, 246, 161, 399, 288]"

154,6,"Sorry, but if you think this movie was original and unpredictable, I beg to disagree. That, or you're young or you just haven't seen enough movies. That said, I think it's more the scriptwriters/director's fault that people like me don't enjoy it. The talented (talented being an understatement) voices are there, but the premise, the ""big"" reveal of the ""villain"", the progression of the story are some of the movie's failures. The story behind Elsa's power? That back-story alone may well be more interesting than Frozen's. The villain? The reveal didn't play out realistically, it seemed fake/scripted/out of place. And finally progression, not a spoiler but a grand staircase leads right to Elsa's ""hiding place"". How convenient for Anna. And she and the ice guy reach it practically the next day -.- Frodo and Sam'll have something to say about this. I mean, didn't Elsa want to isolate herself? So grand staircases are supposed to drive visitors away, amirite. (sarcasm) I'd also like to add nil character development. Anyway, those points above, among others, made me unaffected by supposedly dramatic events (I'm looking at you Elsa&Anna's parents), made this a forgettable movie for me. I highly recommend a re-watch of Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs or Wreck-it Ralph, and see what's missing or off with Frozen.Last note: 9 stars from a child's point of view though.

I'm a really big Disney fan, so that, in addition to Josh Gad being my favorite actor of all time, I was naturally very excited to lay my eyes on this fresh piece of cinema. The picture starts playing and my pulse is racing like a deer in the headlights and whaddya know, all of a sudden, the characters burst out singing. Like what the heck? Who does that? Can someone explain to me why some dudes sawing ice would start singing? In my opinion, the film's biggest plot hole. It doesn't make any sense. I simply do not understand why characters in cinema sing. The only good part of the movie is Olaf and it is because he is of Josh Gad.

I don't get some of the overly critical reviews on here at all, the songs are catchy, the characters extremely likeable. My 2 year old and I have watched this over and over again, which is more than I can say for a lot of other Disney movies. 
Some have said they don't agree with the matching up of Kristof and Anna and think he would pair better with Elsa...I could not disagree with this more!!
Kristof and Anna have a very obvious connection and spark, they bounce off each other like most couples would do. Anna is much more down to earth than Elsa as well, therefore a far more fitting match.
Everything about this movie is really fab!
I really do wonder if the other reviews come from people who have watched the same movie.
Looking forward to the second one :)","['absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'cute', 'funny', 'adorable', 'magical', 'get', 'overly', 'critical', 'review', 'song', 'catchy', 'character', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'say', 'lot', 'disney', 'movie', 'say', 'agree', 'match', 'kristof', 'anna', 'think', 'would', 'pair', 'well', 'elsa', 'could', 'disagree', 'kristof', 'anna', 'obvious', 'connection', 'spark', 'bounce', 'like', 'couple', 'would', 'anna', 'much', 'earth', 'elsa', 'well', 'therefore', 'far', 'fitting', 'match', 'everything', 'movie', 'really', 'fab', 'really', 'wonder', 'review', 'come', 'people', 'watch', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'second', 'one']","[292, 6, 1, 265, 85, 687, 170, 19, 1200, 1458, 161, 11, 266, 8, 423, 2565, 47, 64, 23, 35, 84, 2, 1, 35, 729, 553, 1230, 7, 37, 26, 1441, 18, 4, 54, 2109, 1230, 7, 595, 1189, 2699, 1969, 9, 398, 26, 7, 31, 1776, 4, 18, 1241, 142, 1993, 553, 132, 1, 22, 4271, 22, 532, 161, 40, 46, 23, 1, 66, 571, 319, 10]"
158,6,"Frozen is directed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, and is one of Disney's newest animated movies. The story follows Anna (Kristen Bell) and her older sister Elsa (Idina Menzel) as Elsa reveals to their kingdom of Arendelle that she has secret ice powers, and immediately runs away to build an ice castle and be alone, freezing Arendelle in the process. Anna must team up with mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven, along with little snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) in order to find her sister and thaw out their frozen kingdom. To start, I enjoy Disney movies, when they're good. I'm not bias against this movie at all. I wish it would've been good, but it just wasn't. The same old Disney formula was used here, utilizing dead parents, a female heroine that needs a man (in this case, two), and a ""funny"" supporting character. This formula has been used so much, it's almost like watching parts of the same story over and over. This is why Disney movies such as Big Hero 6 (2014) and Wreck-It- Ralph (2012) are such a breath of fresh air from Disney, and are generally good films. The best thing I can say about this film is the music. This move has the best music in a Disney movie since The Lion King (1994). With songs like ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman?"" and the ever so famous ""Let It Go,"" It has some pretty good music. Then it has ""For The First Time In Forever."" This song is good, yes, but, it's taken straight from the movie Tangled (2010). All Disney did is change the verses. and insert it into this film's soundtrack. However, the music is still the best thing this film has going for it.The first horrible thing this movie brings to the table is it's elaborate plot. The plot sounds simple, indeed, but there's so many subplots in this film that it's truly hard identifying the overlying, main plot. To list some of them: unfreezing Arendelle, Anna making friends with Elsa, Anna marrying Prince Hans (Santino Fontana), Anna marrying Kristoff, etc. I've narrowed it down to the first two listed above, but I can't figure out which one is the predominant plot.However confusing the plot is, I do have to mention the directing and animation. The animation, mostly, is very good in this film. There's absolutely no complaints to be had with it. There are no ugly shots in the movie at all.The last thing I'll mention is the character, mostly Anna. To save least last, I'll start with Elsa. Elsa honestly isn't too bad of a character, but she is a confusing one. Her emotion is hard to read, but that, at points, is a good thing. Overall I'd say Idina Menzel does pretty good as Queen Elsa. Kristoff is a good quality character as well. His funny relationship with Sven, a reindeer, is probably the most funny thing in the entire film. This leads me into the next character: Olaf. Olaf is a snowman that tries to be the Timon and Pumbaa (from The Lion King) of this movie. However, Timon and Pumbaa were likable, and fun. Olaf just isn't. Josh Gad doesn't do great with this character, however, he doesn't exactly good bad either. Olaf is ultimately okay. Just that.The last character, and definite worst thing about this whole movie is Anna. Anna is a princess that constantly needs a prince. She's not a strong female character at all, and is very disappointing all around. To compare to another Disney princess, I'll use Belle from The Beauty and The Beast (1991). Belle was a strong, independent woman that went alone to save her father, due to none of the ""tough"" men in the entire town volunteering to help. She was at first imprisoned by the Beast, and fell in love with his personality, and what's on the inside, despite his monstrosity of an appearance. Anna falls in love with Prince Hans due to his title: prince. Just due to his money and role in society, she falls for him. This makes Frozen a disappointment for any female character.Overall, Frozen has a messed up plot, and upsetting characters, mixed with great animation and wonderful music. It's definitely the worst Disney film since The Emperor's New Groove (2000). I think Frozen deserves a C, or a 6 out of 10.","['frozen', 'direct', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'chris', 'buck', 'one', 'disney', 'new', 'animate', 'movie', 'story', 'follow', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell',

159,7,"Since Disney's decision to drop drawn animation for 3D animation it was uncertain what quality of animation we would get. However, after the great movie experience that was ""Tangled"" Disney has proved that they can indeed continue quality work in a new format. Just to be clear for this review I'm dividing Pixar and Disney as separate companies.In my opinion the strength of the old drawn Disney movies lies in the character development and atmosphere. Together with a good pacing and songs to draw me into the moment, these movies have become a warm feeling of nostalgia for me. I understand that change is needed in order to keep things new and fresh and that is why I'm complimenting Tangled on a good blend of new and old, especially story and character development.Now what about Frozen, well I'll be honest with you all this movie really needs to take itself more seriously and they should recut it. Compared to Tangled it seems like Disney has lost focus during development, which is a shame because it really had potential to become something good instead of the decent movie that it is.Let me first start with what was bad about it. - The movie spends too much time on comedy relieve moments when the movie clearly doesn't need it and because of this some moments really suffered. Like old Disney movies Frozen also has singing moments to develop the story further and this was done well for the most part. However, some songs really weren't necessary and it felt that they were there just to be there. This dragged the movie down resulting in an uncomfortable story pacing midway. The biggest problem that I have with this movie is actually character development, more specifically the development of the antagonist (if there is one) and the side characters. The movie spends too little time on developing anyone else apart from the protagonist and because of this; it was hard to really feel for anyone. Ask yourself this question: how can you feel for someone if you don't really know him/her. If the protagonist doesn't REALLY know her own sister or anyone close to her, how can any emotional feelings develop? This is a shame and I hope Disney will not continue this trend because they were very good at conveying emotions.Plus there are some other minor things that could be considered nitpicking (e.g., Disney's subtle departure of their old story telling).So is there anything good about the movie? Well yes there is.The saving grace of this movie is the protagonist. She is funny, likable and the only character that really shows any growth from beginning to end. Through her eyes we really do experience wonder.When the moment is right the humor in this movie is very funny and refreshing.3D animation is very well done and beautiful to look at. Especially the beginning.Music is good especially the background music.

160,7,"This is Disney at it's simplest and surest - a plain and fun fantasy about a princess with magical powers, a handsome prince, a couple of goofy characters to provide regular light relief, and a couple of really mean villeins, of course.Very 'Disney' in it's values - the family is no. 1, good people are beautiful and young, bad people typically ugly, old and have eastern European accents, animals are cute. Actually, the film does break a couple of these rules, but one is very conscious that this is Disneytopia, right down to the emotional manipulation and total lack of depth to any character. Yes, I know it's a kids movie, but all the same ...Pros: passes the time and gives some smiles, although no big laughs for the adults, or for the children really.Cons: animation is a little lacking - TV rather than big-screen quality much of the time. Also, there is a LOT of singing, and nothing particularly memorable! (E.g., ""Something, something ... let's build a snowman, ... something."") I'd have preferred a bit more goofing around with the fun characters.Overall: my wife and I saw it on a Sunday evening with a lot of young children in the cinema - not a lot of reaction from them, while it held the attention, would have like to have heard more laughter.

161,7,"Overall I liked it, decent story, some amazing visuals and musical numbers. I couldn't recognize any of the voice actors and the story was strong enough that they didn't need big Hollywood talent to sell the movie. One of my favorite parts was before the movie started: you can see the influence past Pixar president and current Disney Animation Czar John Lasseter has as there was a Pixar-esque short before the film, where they took either a classic Mickey cartoon or made a new one to look like a classic toon, and made a madcap mini-movie, which actually surprised me how violent it was, but totally in line with the old cartoons. Back to the feature, on an artistic level I thought is was lacking a bit, but they set the bar so high on ""Tangled"" that there was no way to go but down. While some of the artwork was amazing, I noticed many scenes where textures and shadows were lacking; sometimes the characters seemed to float off the background instead of living in it. Again, I/we have been spoiled. Also there seemed to be a rush to get 8-9 songs thrown in and most of them were forgettable, just there for (unnecessary) exposition. 1 or 2 decent ones, but nowhere near enough to consider purchasing the soundtrack.

To be certain, the song made an appearance on ""Democracy Now!"" during one of the interludes during Amy Goodman's interview with George Takei. Yes, I never thought that it would happen, but a Disney song actually appeared on the most no-nonsense show in media.As for the movie itself, I didn't find it to be a masterpiece, but it's OK. The theme of getting forced to hide something about oneself for fear of getting considered ""unnatural"" but then deciding to stop living the lie is a good message. I understand that Elsa and Anna have drawn criticism for having eyes that are bigger than their wrists. Not surprisingly, the main song has made the religious nuts claim that the movie promotes the ""gay agenda"".

166,1,"In the last 4 years or so, after releasing some duds for the first half of this decade (Atlantis, Brother Bear, Chicken Little,) Disney has finally returned to its' roots, releasing films that are on par with the classics (Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph.)So naturally, I had high hopes for this year's spring release of Frozen. I sat down to watch it and couldn't believe my eyes!Plot holes, contradictions, mostly forgettable musical numbers and bad jokes abound in this film that is SOMEHOW being hailed as ""the best Disney movie in years!"" but makes me feel like the creators were more concerned about how many dolls they'd sell, rather than putting together a good story!The story is about this princess named Elsa, who is, for some reason never explained, born with the ability to create ice and snow out of thin air. After she accidentally throws ice at her sister, Anna her parents, after being told by a bunch of trolls that ""fear will be her enemy"" LOCK HER IN HER ROOM HER ENTIRE CHILDHOOD, no doubt giving the fear that she's supposed to learn to let go of every opportunity to rise.Fast forward to three years later and Elsa is about to be crowned queen; surprising as no one's seen her for years; why would they want her to rule them? However, after a falling out with Anna, her powers are exposed and she runs away to the mountains to build an ice palace where she declares she will live on her own forever more so that everyone, especially her sister can be safe from her. Did I mention that she accidentally freezes her entire kingdom and won't try to figure out how to unfreeze it, or that she sets a giant snow monster (she apparently can create sentient beings now) on her sister when she follows her? Okay, it's one thing if the plot makes no sense but what about the characters? I've already given my take on Elsa, so I'll go through the rest of them individually.Anna is easily my favorite character in this film. I love how for once instead of making their princess practically perfect in every way, they made her someone who is clumsy and gets into messes that she has to get out of. Anna's klutzy moves, such as when she accidentally squashes her sister's coronation cake with a bust make me laugh out loud. On top of that, I really applaud the unending determination she has to be with her sister again and cheer for her all the way through.My second favorite character would have to be Hans, a foreign prince who comes to the kingdom for Elsa's coronation and ends up becoming Anna's love interest, due to the fact that his older brothers have treated him the same way Elsa has treated her. He also acts in a refreshingly fun and goofy way and on top of that, he has such an admirable level of competence, taking it upon himself to look after the whole kingdom when Anna goes to find Elsa.Apart from those two however, I find myself really disliking the remaining characters and even question their inclusion in the film. Olaf, the comic-relief snowman continuously makes jokes that are completely irrelevant to the plot and really feels like he was just stuck in there so that the Disney Store could get a cuddly stuffed toy on their shelves. Meanwhile, Kristoff, the mountain guide who replaces Hans as Anna's beau is hands down one of the most BORING Disney characters ever. He never makes any mistakes, constantly does everything right and makes me cry a little inside because he ends up with Anna instead of the far more interesting prince. The songs, well actually...some of them are alright; ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"", a song sung by young Anna about how lonely she gets without her sister is cute enough, while ""Love is An Open Door"", a duet for Anna and Hans, while perhaps a little corny is nice, upbeat and does leave you happy for the two of them. On the other hand songs like ""Let it Go"" and ""Fixer Upper"" have very weird contexts that leave you confused. The latter is sung by the trolls to Anna about how Kristoff is no Prince Charming, but could be with a little fixing; who in the world says that about their child? The former is supposed to be empowering...I think, as Elsa sings about how she finally doesn't have to worry about her powers hurting anyone and can now use them freely in isolation, but what, I ask you is so empowering about being cut off from the rest of the world? I should mention as well that the songs are very unevenly placed throughout the movie, with there being about 4 in the first 20 minutes and then none happening again, until the last third. In addition to the above problems, the story feels like it's ripping off a number of others. The plot plays out in a fashion eerily similar to Stephen Schwartz's Wicked and Olaf , while cute in design, is basically Ice Age's Sid in snow form. The one star that I give this movie is simply for the animation, because being Disney, it's still very pretty. Hopefully this movie isn't the start of a downward spiral in the hits that Disney has been producing in the last little while. Those three films I mentioned earlier are ones that I've added to my DVD collection, have re-watched and will be watching again. This one, however, is not.I wish that I could turn back the clock and live in a world where Frozen did not exist.","['last', 'year', 'release', 'dud', 'first', 'half', 'decade', 'atlantis', 'brother',

167,9,"I certainly DON'T think this movie is overrated (or perhaps people know something I don't know), but whoever is making those accusations, WHAT exactly are they comparing it to?? For people saying this movie or the song ""Let It Go"" is overrated, what exactly are they comparing it to?? Almost 99% of the mainstream movies and music out there are immoral unethical garbage in this culture just to make a fast buck without anything meaningful in the plots or lyrics.This film is especially SO FAMOUS in Japan where I was born and raised and in fact still live, and I'm really looking forward to how children of this generation are going to turn into GREAT people in the near future, because of the impact of this magical flick. (Though I'm a little confused as to why ""Wreck-It Ralph"" isn't as popular since SO many people from Japan love to play video games). ;) This film can teach children (especially girls) and also adults to let go of the past, to become self-reliant, and real love. This is something worthwhile children can learn from and help to create a potentially better future.BUT... if there is a downside to it, I maybe got a little confused to the hype of this film; I saw it, and wondered a bit if I saw the same movie everyone else did, 'cause the story looked really SIMPLE; someone leaves, others go off to get them, and they all come back. The end. It MAY seem that way, but they do make up for it with all the great songs, the amazing soundtrack, colorful & memorable characters, funny humorous and feel-good moments, breathtaking landscapes, lovely & realistic animation, the unexpected plot twists, and the overall valuable important messages it teaches.Look at what young people have to grow up with these days: constant violence and sexual immorality on TV and music and Internet, government corruption, global environment disasters and wars, etc. At least children have something good to learn how to act in such a stressful future they will one day have to take control of.As for the haters commenting (usually on YouTube but probably here in comments later on as more ppl read this), they are unthinkable bi-products of our mostly violent media culture.Believe it or not, I'm a GUY who likes this film, even if the two main characters are female. I LOVE the music too - I could listen to it over & over. (But hey, if ""Frozen"" is a film that girls can relate to, then ""Big Hero 6"" is a film definitely boys can relate to.)And what else? Positive emotions are contagious. In other words, when people are happy it spreads to other people much faster and farther than negative emotions which have a weaker effect on others; LOVE really is the biggest power there is (besides the love of God.) So as advice to children, take the advice of this famous movie and its famous song! Let go of the past, avoid evil people who only want to drag others down, focus on being with friendly people and live your life to the fullest. You deserve it. If you have a bad day, increase your positive energy even more.AND also... an immoral unhappy society usually degenerates into a paranoid police state. A society that promotes real love, forgiveness, respect, and friendliness have better chances of keeping a freer society. And the positive values mentioned above are what everyone is being taught through the message of the entire movie, especially at the end.Plus, the singer, Idina Menzel, who voiced Elsa & sung ""Let It Go"", and the the guy who voiced Olaf are Jewish! I've a got a real soft spot for Jewish people, and I think it's all the more reason to like this film. And I'm glad Disney won the Oscar it SHOULD have for ""Wreck-It Ralph"", rather than the disappointing ""Brave"" bomb.I do also think this flick is rather ""Christ-like"" in it's message; whether it be ""Some people are worth melting for"", or Anna ""sacrifices"" herself to save her sister.PS: Oh, and if you're wondering why I say ""children"", and not ""kids"", kids are offspring of goats - and Satanism has the head of a goat.

Unfortunately, my fears were confirmed as this movie is faithful to Disney's identity. This isn't necessarily bad, but when it comes to animation movies, Pixar has raised the bar and Disney was forced to roll up it's sleeves to top them. An Oscar may have fell on Frozen's lap, but it's still miles and miles away from what Pixar can do.Nothing in this movie is worthy of mention, unless you're five years old. Disney has actually set a new low and it's sad to see Despicable Me 2 losing to this poor attempt of movie.","['see', 'score', 'thought', 'would', 'movie', 'worthy', 'see', 'disappointment', 'big', 'understand', 'could', 'less', 'average', 'movie', 'win', 'oscar', 'story', 'absolutely', 'banal', 'character', 'constantly', 'fail', 'funny', 'excessive', 'sing', 'clearly', 'becomes', 'animate', 'musical', 'average', 'animation', 'say', 'come', 'disney', 'expect', 'much', 'win', 'oscar', 'strong', 'classification', 'imdb', 'make', 'go', 'spend', 'min', 'watch', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'fear', 'confirm', 'movie', 'faithful', 'disney', 'identity', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'come', 'animation', 'movie', 'pixar', 'raise', 'bar', 'disney', 'force', 'roll', 'sleeve', 'top', 'oscar', 'may', 'fell', 'frozen', 'lap', 'still', 'mile', 'mile', 'away', 'pixar', 'nothing', 'movie', 'worthy', 'mention', 'unless', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'disney', 'actually', 'set', 'new', 'low', 'sad', 'see', 'despicable', 'lose', 'poor', 'attempt', 'movie']","[16, 223, 92, 26, 1, 790, 16, 1038, 106, 216, 54, 321, 921, 1, 374, 302, 12, 292, 4288, 8, 1176, 1166, 85, 2605, 63, 690, 380, 38, 51, 921, 21, 35, 40, 2, 131, 31, 374, 302, 167, 866, 14, 13, 1031, 1624, 23, 1, 573, 187, 2711, 1, 2561, 2, 2436, 1284, 65, 40, 21, 1, 194, 760, 1477, 2, 272, 985, 4289, 239, 302, 171, 843, 5, 4290, 68, 1784, 1784, 101, 194, 156, 1, 790, 348, 959, 731, 47, 64, 2, 103, 144, 108, 1023, 579, 16, 1158, 489, 973, 448, 1]"

170,8,"Disney's FROZEN is a really great film by all means, but is it perfect and amazing than High School Musical 2, which is also a movie distributed by Walt Disney Pictures? Yes, it is. Is it far being the best Disney movie ever made? Simply and positively, No. Is the movie better than any other musical film? Yes and no.Inspired by a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, ""The Snow Queen"", FROZEN tells the story of a fearless princess named Anna, who sets out an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, Kristoff, his loyal pet reindeer Sven, and a naive snowman named Olaf, who loves summer to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.Watching this movie for the first time, I had no idea what the hell was this movie was going to be about or if I was going to like it or not because the trailer did not give any plot details away.I really hoped I could like this movie because the director of this film, Chris Buck, also directed another Disney film, TARZAN. I was pleased with the results and not pleased with some of the things.The first few minutes of this movie got me thinking it was going to be just a regular girls movie about a princess meeting a prince and they fall in love kind-of-a-movie. The film did not focus on any romantic relationship at all as this film focused on the two main characters Anna and Elsa.Elsa (played by Indina Menzel) was a character that I had mixed feelings over when I first saw this film and the CGI is well cool on her character and her powers are just fantastic to see in Disney Digital 3D, way back in November 2013.Anna (played by Kristen Bell) is really fantastic and she is a character that you would like to see throughout the whole film and the animation and CGI on her is really amazing. Kristoff (played by Johnathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven are cool with the animation really done on them as well too.Hans (played by Santino Fontana) is really a good antagonist for the film and the way his animation is done on him was just impressive as hell, but I really think his character is simply evil.Then, finally, my favorite character of the entire film, which is the little snowman Olaf (played by Josh Gad) and his CGI and animation is really great and is really fantastic and I thought it was really amazing to see a living and breathing little snowman on screen.Those performances in the film were just excellent. The songs in this film is really amazing and just a joy to hear. My favorite songs in the film is ""For The First Time in Forever"", ""Let It Go"" - both the Indina Menzel and Demi Lovato versions, ""Do You Want to Build A Snowman?"" and the song that Olaf sings called, ""I Love Summer"" and also, there may be way too many songs in this film, but as a Disney movie musical, it works.The musical score composed by Christophe Beck and his musical score is just amazing as his musical score for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel were simply incredible. But back to the musical score, his score is just extraordinary and his female-choir that he used for this film is just amazing.The film gives you a lot of very funny laughs that everyone can enjoy and laugh at. The characters, like I said, are all original and very amazing and fantastic and just incredibly well-done and is very spectacular.The only criticism I have is that there are parts where the characters just break out into song, and don't get me wrong, they do this in all musical movies, but with FROZEN, it is no different.I find one of the main characters already singing and just break out singing in this film and I'm sometimes, while watching the film, ""Come on, man! Do you really have to do that?"".The plot is very cliché in a few areas, but it's still an enjoyable plot and I wish that some animated movies stay true to their original source material, but for whatever reason, with all or some movies, this film can't seem to do that.This movie is as fun for my sisters and all kids and teenagers, because it is a Disney musical released and it is the best Disney film in 10 years and to hear that this movie took a long time to make, really helped make this movie the best that it can be.The film is not as good as TARZAN or the Disney / Pixar's TOY STORY film franchise and it is not the best Disney film in the world, but it could not have been done better and it also could have been a hell of a lot worse.FROZEN will make you laugh, cry, sing and have you re-watch this movie for a good 26 days or a good 10 days and it is a definitive great family film.This is the way a Disney musical film, live action or animation, and all musical films in general should be made. It should be about the plot, characters and music all at once.This film gets a 8 out of 10 - again, not the best Disney film in the world, but it could have been worse, but it is a great film overall.","['disney', 'frozen', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'mean', 'perfect', 'amaze', 'high', 'school', 'musical', 'also', 'movie', 'distribute', 'walt', 'disney', 'picture', 'yes', 'far', 'best',

172,9,"So, it's been about a year since ""Frozen""- one of the biggest and most rampantly popular Disney releases in quite some time- hit theaters. A year for audiences to get over the initial ""high"" of seeing it for the first time and review it with a more objective, critical eye. I find that often, after a few months, my opinion of a film will have changed somewhat, and I'm usually slightly more analytical and critical to it's strengths and faults. Which is why I held off on reviewing this particular film right away.So, looking back a year later, does ""Frozen"" still hold up?Yes. Yes it does. Rather magnificently.While it's never QUITE able to live up to other Disney Classics, and it does have a few dodgy moments here and there, ""Frozen"" is a shockingly well-made film, boasting not only immensely impressive visuals and direction, but some of the best musical work in an animated family film I've ever heard, in addition to some wonderfully developed characters and great humor. It's another near-flawless example of Disney doing what it does best.We follow two princess sisters- Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel), who were the best of friends as children. However, Elsa possessed a strange magical ability- the ability to create snow, ice and cold through her hands. Unable to control his power, the sister's parents have a wise mystical troll erase Anna's memory of Elsa's abilities, and keep them separated through much of their lives for their own respective safety, so Elsa can try and learn to control her powers without inadvertently hurting her sister.Years later, after their parent's deaths, Elsa emerges from solitude to be crowned queen. However, after a mistake reveals her powers to the people of her kingdom- thus causing the concerned public to see her as a potential threat, she leaves to live alone, accidentally covering the kingdom in an eternal winter. And so it is up to Anna to try to help her sister learn to control her powers, and end the dreaded winter. And along the way, Anna is joined by a colorful cast of characters, including a good-hearted ice merchant (Jonathan Groff), his pet/companion reindeer, and a unrelentingly-optimistic snowman called ""Olaf"" (Josh Gad) who was unknowingly brought to life by Elsa's powers.The cast is absolutely perfect. Bell is absolutely fun as a quirky, spunky princess who goes through a comical-yet-emotional journey for the sake of her sister, and is endlessly likable. Groff and Gad round out the supporting cast perfectly, bringing a great deal of charm and charisma to their roles. (Though Gad does occasionally come off as a bit annoying early on.) And other supporting roles by actors such as Santio Fontana and Alan Tudyk are great compliments.However, the shining star is Idina Menzel. She breaths such an immense life into Elsa, and gives the character so much heart, pathos and depth, I would venture to say her performance easily should have earned her an Oscar nod, despite being a voice-only role. And I was very happy when her song ""Let it Go"" won the Oscar for Best Song. I know it was written by the rampantly talented songwriters Robert and Kristen-Anderson Lopez, but Menzel is what truly elevated the song to greatness.Production is top-notch. Direction courtesy Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee is astounding. The duo bring the world to life in such an incredible way, and their choices elevate the already strong material to new bounds. The script (written by Lee from a story treatment she also co-wrote) is also phenomenal, and is highly admirable from a character-development standpoint. In just 100 minutes, the film is able to fully establish, craft, develop and pay-off a world and characters in a way that most other films can only dream to.The animation is superb. The snow and water effects looking shockingly true-to-life, while the character and setting design is nicely stylized while also feeling organic and ""true."" It's able to construct everything so well, that despite being animated, you swear you could actually touch the snow, touch the buildings, touch the characters, etc. And it thankfully never delves into the ""uncanny valley."" And of course, the music (score by Christophe Beck and songs by the aforementioned due of the Lopez's) fits in so perfectly.I could really gush on and on over how much this film does right. However, that being said, there are a few things that hold it back from perfection, which is where the film loses a point.I do think that there are some pacing issues at times in the storytelling. The film moves just a wee-bit too fast at times, particularly in the first 45 minutes, which is a bit of a negative. I also feel that the scope is somewhat limited. Everything feels a bit too small and intimate for the sort-of tale that's being told. And I think the film is uneven in how it presents certain characters and situations. (A few characters get a ton of screen time early on, only to be sort-of ""forgotten about"" later, making them feel misused. Or other characters like the trolls, whose only appearances are brief and more akin to cameos, despite their important roles in the story.) I also do think a few too many jokes fall flat.But I can forgive those flaws when it comes to the big picture. This is a fantastic film from any stretch of the imagination, and I'm happy to own it on Blu-Ray. It's definitely one of those films I will be revisiting consistently, and enjoying each and every time.I give ""Frozen"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10. It most definitely lives up to the hype. It just isn't quite flawless.","['year', 'since', 'frozen', 'one', 'big', 'rampantly', 'popular', 'disney', 'release', 'quite', 'time', 'hit', 'theater', 'year', 'audience', 'get', 'initial', 'high',

174,8,"After looking forward to seeing both ""Epic"" by Blue Sky Studios and ""Frozen"" by Disney, I saw both of them this weekend.The main character of ""Epic"" looks like a twin of the main character of ""Frozen"". Also, one movie deals with cold vs warm and the other deals with decay vs growth. Finally, both movies rely a lot on beautiful nature shots. For these reasons, I felt I should review both together.""Frozen"" was much better than I expected. Frozen reminded me a lot of traditional Disney classics like Snow White, Dumbo or Bambi. Yes there was singing, but the singing was surprisingly traditional without sounding corny and outdated. Unlike in most cartoons that involve singing, in ""Frozen"" it enhanced the experience rather than being a turn-off.""Frozen"" also had a rather well-developed story. It wasn't a traditional good-vs-evil story where the good were perfect and the bad haven't got a single redeeming quality. It also wasn't yet another generic ""we must remain ourselves and fight tradition"" story like Mulan, Brave and so many others out there. The characters felt more real than I'm used to in a Disney flick and combined with some humor that actually works, that makes ""Frozen"" one of the most entertaining animations I've seen in a long time.""Epic"" was an ""epic failure"" in all of these area. The characters were bland and generic. The story was bland and generic and felt like they mixed ""Arthur and the Minimoys"", ""Antz"" and ""Ferngully"" together, then filtered until nothing interesting was left.The humor didn't work either. As silly as the talking snowman in ""Frozen"" may look, he actually did work as a comic relief. His actions were funny, his words were funny and he complemented the heroes of the movie well. In ""Epic"", a snail and a slug served the very same purpose, only they were annoying as h***. Think Jar Jar Bing annoying and worse.The only thing that works in ""Epic"" are its visuals. If I just wanted to look at pretty pictures, both ""Frozen"" and ""Epic"" would be equally beautiful. The problem is that a movie is more than pretty pictures. A movie is entertainment and needs to entertain. While ""Frozen"" was much better than I expected, ""Epic"" was much worse.","['look', 'forward', 'see', 'epic', 'blue', 'sky', 'studio', 'frozen', 'disney', 'saw', 'weekend', 'main', 'character', 'epic', 'look', 'like', 'twin', 'main', 'character', 'frozen', 'also', 'one', 'movie', 'deal', 'cold', 'v', 'warm', 'deal', 'decay', 'v', 'growth', 'finally', 'movie', 'rely', 'lot', 'beautiful', 'nature', 'shot', 'reason', 'felt', 'review', 'together', 'frozen', 'much', 'well', 'expect', 'frozen', 'remind', 'lot', 'traditional', 'disney', 'classic', 'like', 'snow', 'white', 'dumbo', 'bambi', 'yes', 'sing', 'sing', 'surprisingly', 'traditional', 'without', 'sound', 'corny', 'outdated', 'unlike', 'cartoon', 'involve', 'sing', 'frozen', 'enhance', 'experience', 'rather', 'turn', 'frozen', 'also', 'rather', 'well', 'developed', 'story', 'traditional', 'good', 'v', 'evil', 'story', 'good', 'perfect', 'bad', 'get', 'single', 'redeem', 'quality', 'also', 'yet', 'another', 'generic', 'must', 'remain', 'fight', 'tradition', 'story', 'like', 'mulan', 'brave', 'many', 'others', 'character', 'felt', 'real', 'use', 'disney', 'flick', 'combine', 'humor', 'actually', 'work', 'make', 'frozen', 'one', 'entertain', 'animation', 'see', 'long', 'time', 'epic', 'epic', 'failure', 'area', 'character', 'bland', 'generic', 'story', 'bland', 'generic', 'felt', 'like', 'mixed', 'arthur', 'minimoys', 'antz', 'ferngully', 'together', 'filter', 'nothing', 'interest', 'left', 'humor', 'work', 'either', 'silly', 'talk', 'snowman', 'frozen', 'may', 'look', 'actually', 'work', 'comic', 'relief', 'action', 'funny', 'word', 'funny', 'complement', 'hero', 'movie', 'well', 'epic', 'snail', 'slug', 'serve', 'purpose', 'annoy', 'h', 'think', 'jar', 'jar', 'bing', 'annoy', 'bad', 'thing', 'work', 'epic', 'visuals', 'want', 'look', 'pretty', 'picture', 'frozen', 'epic', 'would', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'problem', 'movie', 'pretty', 'picture', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'need', 'entertain', 'frozen', 'much', 'well', 'expect', 'epic', 'much', 'bad']","[66, 571, 16, 566, 991, 1395, 311, 5, 2, 157, 2010, 119, 8, 566, 66, 9, 119, 8, 5, 27, 10, 1, 701, 366, 1330, 362, 701, 1330, 3074, 241, 1, 1299, 84, 93, 1094, 1103, 180, 155, 161, 332, 5, 31, 18, 131, 5, 1047, 84, 462, 2, 69, 9, 39, 365, 2222, 2040, 325, 63, 63, 1179, 462, 137, 259, 1737, 766, 314, 584, 63, 5, 3020, 334, 191, 113, 5, 27, 191, 18, 610, 12, 462, 17, 1330, 277, 12, 17, 175, 65, 19, 741, 1199, 283, 27, 182, 102, 969, 236, 1436, 816, 1071, 12, 9, 931, 335, 61, 247, 8, 155, 195, 158, 2, 805, 1096, 222, 103, 107, 14, 5, 10, 243, 21, 16, 169, 20, 566, 566, 1623, 1266, 8, 811, 969, 12, 811, 969, 155, 9, 1082, 4301, 4302, 332, 3565, 156, 122, 330, 222, 107, 353, 847, 178, 45, 5, 171, 66, 103, 107, 309, 297, 345, 85, 548, 85, 2715, 544, 1, 18, 566, 1173, 646, 238, 2051, 37, 1007, 1007, 238, 65, 43, 107, 566, 267, 59, 66, 136, 438, 5, 566, 26, 1169, 93, 198, 1, 136, 438, 1, 839, 99, 243, 5, 31, 18, 131, 566, 31, 65]"
175,6,"I Won't spoil anything but I'll make some points about what i liked and did not. First of all I cannot decide whether this is good or bad.I do not understand how this film got an 8/10 rating.It's not bad,in fact this movie has the most unique and magical princess(Or Queen) in Disney's History(At least for me) And they did not even give her enough screen time. OK lets cut to the chase.There was a lot of potential in this movie,mainly the ice princess concept was really interesting and Elsa was a really spectacular character and she is the only reason i gave it a 6. And it would have been a good tear jerking movie but instead they decided to do a comedy.

Visually it was spectacular.Hats off to the art team and Animators for their flawless character movements and the Incredible designs for the ice elements in the film.The main drawback is the story and some unnecessary characters.If you are planning to watch this film then do it without expecting much and surely it does not live up to the hype.

Though they do delve into their own type of humor a tad often, it doesn't distract from the light-hearted drama that makes it an interesting film. Then there is another distraction that does get a little heavy after a while, and that's the start of the songs. They have songs very often throughout the films, and the beginning of them just seem out of place and forced into the scene. Though they are rather catchy and decent songs, they really could have done without them. A lot of the antagonists could have used a little more characterization, seeming to just shout ""I AM A VILLAIN"" when you first see them, although there is the cloak and dagger effect that I rather liked. All in all, it was a solid film, just not one of Disney's better animated movies.

177,8,"Version I saw: UK cinema screening (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 9/10Photography/visual style: 9/10Music/score: 9/10Overall: 8/10Everyone I know who has been to see Disney's 'Frozen' came out raving about it, and rightly so. It blends classic old Disney, sassy new Disney, a clever subtext that delivers an important message, two strong female leads, stunning visuals, great songs and avalanches of charm.Inspired more by the style and context of Hans Christian Andersen's work than his particular story 'The Snow Queen', the stated inspiration for the film, Frozen follows Anna and Elsa, princesses in medievalish Arandelle. Elsa becomes a shut-in to hide her ice-controlling powers, then flees when she is unable to keep them concealed. The feisty Anna chases after her.It is hard to overstate how much love I have for Frozen. I love the two main characters. I love the authentic relationship between the sisters. I love the supporting cast, the clever script, the attention to detail throughout the design of environments. Somewhat to my surprise, I love the songs. I love the story, and the message.As with any story in which someone is rejected and cast out for being 'different', the plot of Frozen can be viewed as a metaphor for homosexuality. Like all the best allegories of this kind, the story does not depend on it at all. You can perfectly well view and enjoy Frozen as being purely about magical powers in a medievalish setting... but as a metaphor, it has several details that I find extremely commendable and refreshing, and it's very modern, very worthwhile, and presented with perfectly balanced subtlety: not too intrusive to interfere with the story, yet obvious enough to get through to the watching kids, for whom this lesson will be a very valuable one.It's the complete film experience: fulfilling, heart-warming, worthy, thought-provoking, visually stunning, intelligent and clever and visceral. Just go watch it, if you haven't already, and prepare to be delighted.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/frozen-2013.html","['version', 'saw', 'uk', 'cinema', 'screen', 'actor', 'plot', 'script', 'photography', 'visual', 'style', 'music', 'score', 'overall', 'everyone', 'know', 'see', 'disney', 'frozen', 'come', 'rave', 'rightly', 'blend', 'classic', 'old', 'disney', 'sassy', 'new', 'disney', 'clever', 'subtext', 'delivers', 'important', 'message', 'two', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'stun', 'visuals', 'great', 'song', 'avalanche', 'charm', 'inspire', 'style', 'context', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'work', 'particular', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'state', 'inspiration', 'film', 'frozen', 'follow', 'anna', 'elsa', 'princess', 'medievalish', 'arandelle', 'elsa', 'becomes', 'shut', 'hide', 'ice', 'control', 'power', 'flees', 'unable', 'keep', 'conceal', 'feisty', 'anna', 'chase', 'hard', 'overstate', 'much', 'love', 'frozen', 'love', 'two', 'main', 'character', 'love', 'authentic', 'relationship', 'sister', 'love', 'support', 'cast', 'clever', 'script', 'attention', 'detail', 'throughout', 'design', 'environment', 'somewhat', 'surprise', 'love', 'song', 'love', 'story', 'message', 'story', 'someone', 'reject', 'cast', 'different', 'plot', 'frozen', 'view', 'metaphor', 'homosexuality', 'like', 'best', 'allegory', 'kind', 'story', 'depend', 'perfectly', 'well', 'view', 'enjoy', 'frozen', 'purely', 'magical', 'power', 'medievalish', 'set', 'metaphor', 'several', 'detail', 'find', 'extremely', 'commendable', 'refresh', 'modern', 'worthwhile', 'present', 'perfectly', 'balance', 'subtlety', 'intrusive', 'interfere', 'story', 'yet', 'obvious', 'enough', 'get', 'watch', 'kid', 'lesson', 'valuable', 'one', 'complete', 'film', 'experience', 'fulfil', 'heart', 'warm', 'worthy', 'thought', 'provoke', 'visually', 'stun', 'intelligent', 'clever', 'visceral', 'go', 'watch', 'already', 'prepare', 'delighted', 'full', 'review', 'see', 'independent', 'film', 'blog', 'blogspot', 'cinema', 'inferno', 'http', 'cinemainferno', 'blog', 'blogspot', 'co', 'uk', 'frozen', 'html']","[435, 157, 2717, 543, 369, 518, 52, 395, 450, 355, 58, 223, 166, 109, 56, 16, 2, 5, 40, 2224, 2718, 1551, 69, 64, 2, 4306, 108, 2, 691, 2352, 1143, 289, 185, 42, 167, 237, 248, 315, 267, 25, 11, 235, 500, 355, 1470, 44, 245, 339, 107, 650, 12, 39, 49, 881, 1788, 3, 5, 378, 7, 4, 29, 4307, 2940, 4, 380, 686, 676, 33, 128, 24, 710, 1178, 154, 1232, 1651, 7, 2003, 307, 31, 6, 5, 6, 42, 119, 8, 6, 2225, 153, 15, 6, 740, 227, 691, 395, 541, 468, 296, 424, 1147, 572, 445, 6, 11, 6, 12, 185, 12, 304, 1836, 227, 140, 52, 5, 413, 1326, 2349, 9, 34, 3097, 193, 12, 2719, 456, 18, 413, 91, 5, 2115, 170, 24, 4307, 144, 1326, 608, 468, 71, 423, 3098, 1010, 324, 1907, 663, 456, 677, 2401, 12, 182, 595, 164, 19, 23, 60, 499, 1880, 10, 656, 3, 334, 2116, 80, 362, 790, 92, 1607, 585, 315, 2126, 691, 3345, 13, 23, 397, 3099, 3441, 246, 161, 16, 1058, 3, 1643, 3046, 543, 1666, 1643, 3046, 1263, 2717, 5, 2720]"
178,-,"With a smile on my face, I can say I finally sat through Frozen tonight. I turned off my phone and left aside any note-taking, just absorbed the film for entertainment and on that level, it succeeded on happily keeping me interested. Who doesn't love classic Disney animated musicals? With my short attention span, as I child I bounced from one film to the next singing along and rooting for the happy endings. Frozen hits the refresh button on the classic beat-bopping fairy tales. Pixar has defended the honor of animation for the past decade, but Frozen makes me thankful that children of this day-and-age will be able to have the same childhood memories I had. When the film began and the first song was belted among ice-workers, a feeling came over me and I thought, ""this is the Disney I know.""Frozen's iced snowy visuals sparkle with the beauty we expect every year from the Christmas season and the costumes are drawn with a cool-bite. Like any animated film you'll find, there are the occasional unavoidable gags that are intentionally written for laughs from the target audience.The melodious songs enchant the viewer and draw jumbles of enjoyment from the children in our hearts. The Oscar nominated song, ""Let It Go,"" blows its notes like wind from a hurricane. The characters are etched out with their wings spread, in particular the two central sisters and their relationship, with the voice working pitching the tones of the animations with ease. The characters are given distinct personalities, traits that are compatible with the modern era, and will hopefully separate them from future Disney characters. I had a bold, reoccurring thought during Frozen: this may be the most liberal, intelligent, and humanly-vast of any of the Disney musicals. The olden Disney musicals, bless them and all their brilliance, show love quite superficially compared to the execution Frozen puts out. A prince will not be perfect and love requires us to be accepting of flaws that are eventually revealed. Walt Disney Pictures have taken a commendable step in what they subconsciously teach their younger demographic about love and romance. Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora did not have adequate time to fall in love with their princes, so how did they know it was love? Frozen says with a firm statement the thing adults tell teenagers persistently (even though teens refuse to believe the wisdom), ""you don't know what love is."" Nothing is taken away from the romances those classic princesses, Frozen clarifies the modern definitions of love.Frozen sets certain examples that will hopefully sink into the mindsets of some of the future youth. The evolution of our society and feminism take even further steps in the adaptable emotion of love, the painful effects of isolation, and also refusal to accept of one's flaws. Frozen's modern depth and insights relieve me from dooming it a pleasurable animation.

It's a film about love, friendship and singing catchy tunes. This is the kind of film that, if you were planning an evening at the cinema with your family, you might want to let your husband and sons watch something else. They might enjoy it, but the odds are against it. Technically, the film is flawlessly animated and put together but without breaking any new ground in terms of visuals.

180,-,"Yep Frozen, the beloved animated movie of 2013 is very overrated. The story is okay at best, many clichés and just plain annoying characters really hurt this film for me. Okay i'll admit it, Frozen probably isn't targeted at my age group, but that still makes me wonder how it got all those amazing reviews when the film is clearly targeted at younger children. This doesn't mean Frozen is a bad movie(I gave it 6 stars) it's just very heavily aimed at children, so expect the annoying characters,jokes that just aren't humorous, and the predictable plot. The redeeming factor of Frozen is it's soundtrack: the soundtrack is something special every song on it is great! 'Let it Go' is naturally the stand out song but others like 'Do you want to build a Snowman' are also great.

182,7,"Went to see Frozen because I heard that it got some good reviews and it looked like it might be something enjoyable. As far as Disney movies go it looked great. This animation on was par with Tangled which I really thought was beautiful. The movie started well and the first musical number was good so I thought that it would just get better. But then something happened the story just started to fall flat. The story began getting less interesting and the music started to get really forgettable. In fact when I left the theater I couldn't remember a single melody, that's unfortunate. On a side note I agree with some who feel that the story was slanted too much toward the uninteresting sister Anna instead of Elsa who was the Snow Queen. It was like they were afraid to talk about her struggles and went down the happier, easier path of Anna, love and perkiness. This was a real missed opportunity for Disney to do something memorable for kids who through no fault of their own are different than others. They could have used Elsa's story more effectively and the music could have reflected her beauty and danger better. Too bad. I gave it a 7 for the animation mostly. It's not a classic but it's pretty to look at.","['go', 'see', 'frozen', 'heard', 'get', 'good', 'review', 'look', 'like', 'might', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'far', 'disney', 'movie', 'go', 'look', 'great', 'animation', 'par', 'tangle', 'really', 'thought', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'start', 'well', 'first', 'musical', 'number', 'good', 'thought', 'would', 'get', 'well', 'something', 'happen', 'story', 'start', 'fall', 'flat', 'story', 'begin', 'get', 'less', 'interest', 'music', 'start', 'get', 'really', 'forgettable', 'fact', 'left', 'theater', 'remember', 'single', 'melody', 'unfortunate', 'side', 'note', 'agree', 'feel', 'story', 'slant', 'much', 'toward', 'uninteresting', 'sister', 'anna', 'instead', 'elsa', 'snow', 'queen', 'like', 'afraid', 'talk', 'struggle', 'go', 'happier', 'easy', 'path', 'anna', 'love', 'perkiness', 'real', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'disney', 'something', 'memorable', 'kid', 'fault', 'different', 'others', 'could', 'use', 'elsa', 'story', 'effectively', 'music', 'could', 'reflect', 'beauty', 'danger', 'well', 'bad', 'give', 'animation', 'mostly', 'classic', 'pretty', 'look']","[13, 16, 5, 357, 19, 17, 161, 66, 9, 252, 89, 306, 142, 2, 1, 13, 66, 25, 21, 1028, 83, 22, 92, 93, 1, 120, 18, 36, 51, 184, 17, 92, 26, 19, 18, 89, 290, 12, 120, 186, 838, 12, 160, 19, 321, 122, 58, 120, 19, 22, 660, 201, 330, 312, 391, 741, 1186, 1555, 387, 625, 729, 53, 12, 31, 1791, 2730, 15, 7, 208, 4, 39, 49, 9, 558, 178, 639, 13, 3103, 454, 1347, 7, 6, 195, 271, 759, 2, 89, 268, 60, 1011, 140, 247, 54, 158, 4, 12, 1996, 58, 54, 1384, 149, 901, 18, 65, 57, 21, 567, 69, 136, 66]"

185,8,"For nearly twenty years now, Pixar has dominated the animated scene by making far superior films than the competition, including their mouse-eared partner's in-house efforts. Now that Pixar creator John Lasseter appears to be in charge of Disney's animated projects, it is clear that a changing of the guard is taking place. Old is colliding with new at Disney, and the culmination of this event takes place with the stunning ""Frozen"", a beautiful, touching film with better than average musical numbers, and an unfortunately bland title. If this is where new Disney begins, amazing cinematic experiences lie before us.The symbolic merging of old and new begins before the film itself in the form of a new film short starring, of course, Mickey Mouse and friends. What appears at first to be an old ""Steamboat Willie"" cartoon quickly comes to life, going from black and white to color and three-dimensional characters. The short is clearly representative of what has made the company great in the past, and what is expected to come. As a bonus, children today may be familiar with these old characters due to the popularity of the newer ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" show. Seeing them rendered in 3D isn't a shock to their system like it is for us; conversely, they may be shocked to see the 3D characters in black and white. This interesting amalgamation of technology and nostalgia not only gives us some laughs, but sets a specific tone for ""Frozen"".The film itself begins with a montage of melancholy. Young sisters (and princesses to boot) Anna and Elsa are playing in the palace, when younger Anna prods Elsa to 'use her powers'. It appears that Elsa can make and manipulate the cold from her fingertips, and in a freak accident, Elsa harms her sister to the point where Anna needs 'magical' treatment, and cannot remember the injury. These events lead to an understandable, if not shortsighted overreaction by the king and queen to isolate their 'dangerous' daughter until she can learn to 'control' her power.Unfortunately, they can't control turbulent seas, and they perish- leaving Elsa and Anna alone to mourn their parents and grow up separate from each other. The distance between them becomes exaggerated over time, until they barely know each other by the time Elsa becomes the queen. Perhaps the original story by Hans Christian Andersen tells us (I haven't read it), but there is no mention in the movie of a curse put on Elsa, or an evil witch, or some poisoned fruit she eats that causes her to have powers. It simply exists, meaning Elsa transfers all of the blame to herself. She's been isolated and riddled with so much guilt, self-doubt, and angst that you can't help but feel for her. Keeping that in mind, when her bubble bursts (and it does), it's frightening and gratifying all at once. She escapes the kingdom, retreating to the mountains to be alone. Her 'outburst' turns into one of the most magnificent animated spectacles you'll ever see; exquisitely beautiful, yet strikingly dangerous as it covers the kingdom in 'eternal winter' (it's called 'eternal', but how do we arrive at that conclusion? There is no explanation)Anna goes after her sister, meeting the rugged yet approachable Kristoff (an ice salesman) and his pal reindeer Sven along the way. Naturally, they join the search. These two have an interesting relationship as it pertains to animated films- Sven doesn't talk, but Kristoff holds a conversation with him nonetheless. As other critics have pointed out, a Disney movie of yore would've given Sven the ability to talk; shifting the way that it's presented gives the film a different, and dare I say better, dimension. Another character joins the fray on the way to confront Elsa- a snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad), who can talk. Olaf is a memorable character, in the same vein as Donkey from ""Shrek""- a silly yet endearing sidekick. The movie's biggest laughs come from him.The inevitable confrontation between Elsa, her sister, and the frightened citizens of the snow-covered kingdom resolves itself soon enough. The conclusion is satisfying, sure, but more important is the way in which it concludes. The heroines, one a queen and the other a princess, are allowed to persevere without first securing a 'Prince Charming', or tying their fates to the procurement of a love interest. I love that the filmmakers respect their audience, children and adults alike, enough to give their female leads a different solution. What results is far more powerful and satisfying.Again, we can see the changing of the guard clearly through the lenses of ""Frozen"". It's not a perfect film- in particular, I'd say some of the lyrics in the musical numbers are downright comical, and the title is particularly lame (why not just go with ""The Snow Queen""?). On the whole, however, ""Frozen"" strikes a near-perfect balance between emotion and comedy that brings traditional Disney storytelling into a new age. It's by far the best animated film of the year, and although it may not sit at the head table with other Disney heavy-hitters like ""The Lion King"", I think it's fair to say it's not far behind.","['nearly', 'twenty', 'year', 'pixar', 'dominate', 'animate', 'scene', 'make', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'competition', 'include', 'mouse', 'eared', 'partner', 'house', 'effort', 'pixar',

186,10,"Movies are a huge part of the American culture. Some movies however are not ""up to par"". There are three requirements that a movie must fulfill to be a great movie. These requirements include an inspiring plot, characters with an internal battle, and a fitting resolution to the conflict of the story. One great example of a movie that includes all of these requirements is Disney Pixar's Frozen. The storyline of Frozen is an inspiring story of two sisters, their journey of a lifetime, ""and the bonds of sisterhood""(USA Today). When the sisters are finally reunited after years of solitude and separation, they have a hard time seeing eye-to-eye. Anna and Elsa go through struggles and trials as Elsa tries to find herself and control her powers. These struggles fulfill the next requirement for a good movie.Another storyline in the movie is Anna's love life. After not seeing anyone for years, Anna immediately falls in love with prince Hans. Throughout the course of the story Anna begins to realize her feelings for Christof. Anna's love stories show young women that it is better to wait and learn more about a person, than it is to jump straight into a relationship. Anna love story with Christof, however, is not the main love story of the film. One of the main stories in the movie is about a sister helping her older sister overcome her fears. She is trying to convince her sister that even though she's different, she has worth and she's not a monster. Elsa runs away after accidentally revealing her powers and is labeled as evil by other characters in the movie. Anna, however, ""still believes in her sister, so she ventures into the cold and cruel world outside the gates of Arendelle in search of Elsa""(Chicago Sun-Times). Throughout the beginning of the movie Elsa is trying to hide who she truly is. This is relevant in today's society because people are afraid of what the world will think them. Anna is the inspiration the humanity needs to become more comfortable with itself. The final trait of a good movie is a good conflict resolution. Elsa could not control her powers until she realized that Anna's love was enough. Through her love Arendelle is saved and the kingdom is returned to Elsa's control. This shows that even when everything is out of control and one feels lost, someone's love can save them. This also shows that people should show love and kindness towards others because it will help people through their daily lives.Frozen is a great movie that shows passion, struggle, and triumph. It is an inspiring story with an internal battle within Elsa, and a love that resolves the conflict of the story. Overall Disney has made a great new princess story that will live on for years to come.","['movie', 'huge', 'part', 'american', 'culture', 'movie', 'however', 'par', 'three', 'requirement', 'movie', 'must', 'fulfill', 'great', 'movie', 'requirement', 'include', 'inspire', 'plot', 'character', 'internal', 'battle', 'fitting', 'resolution', 'conflict', 'story', 'one', 'great', 'example', 'movie', 'include', 'requirement', 'disney', 'pixar', 'frozen', 'storyline', 'frozen', 'inspire', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'journey', 'lifetime', 'bond', 'sisterhood', 'usa', 'today', 'sister', 'finally', 'reunite', 'year', 'solitude', 'separation', 'hard', 'time', 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'anna', 'elsa', 'go', 'struggle', 'trial', 'elsa', 'try', 'find', 'control', 'power', 'struggle', 'fulfill', 'next', 'requirement', 'good', 'movie', 'another', 'storyline', 'movie', 'anna', 'love', 'life', 'see', 'anyone', 'year', 'anna', 'immediately', 'fall', 'love', 'prince', 'han', 'throughout', 'course', 'story', 'anna', 'begin', 'realize', 'feeling', 'christof', 'anna', 'love', 'story', 'show', 'young', 'woman', 'well', 'wait', 'learn', 'person', 'jump', 'straight', 'relationship', 'anna', 'love', 'story', 'christof', 'however', 'main', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'one', 'main', 'story', 'movie', 'sister', 'help', 'old', 'sister', 'overcome', 'fear', 'try', 'convince', 'sister', 'even', 'though', 'different', 'worth', 'monster', 'elsa', 'run', 'away', 'accidentally', 'reveal', 'power', 'label', 'evil', 'character', 'movie', 'anna', 'however', 'still', 'believe', 'sister', 'venture', 'cold', 'cruel', 'world', 'outside', 'gate', 'arendelle', 'search', 'elsa', 'chicago', 'sun', 'time', 'throughout', 'begin', 'movie', 'elsa', 'try', 'hide', 'truly', 'relevant', 'today', 'society', 'people', 'afraid', 'world', 'think', 'anna', 'inspiration', 'humanity', 'need', 'become', 'comfortable', 'final', 'trait', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'elsa', 'could', 'control', 'power', 'realize', 'anna', 'love', 'enough', 'love', 'arendelle', 'save', 'kingdom', 'return', 'elsa', 'control', 'show', 'even', 'everything', 'control', 'one', 'feel', 'lose', 'someone', 'love', 'save', 'also', 'show', 'people', 'show', 'love', 'kindness', 'towards', 'others', 'help', 'people', 'daily', 'life', 'frozen', 'great', 'movie', 'show', 'passion', 'struggle', 'triumph', 'inspire', 'story', 'internal', 'battle', 'within', 'elsa', 'love', 'resolve', 'conflict', 'story', 'overall', 'disney', 'make', 'great', 'new', 'princess', 'story', 'live', 'year', 'come']","[1, 360, 94, 1413, 1034, 1, 110, 1028, 433, 2451, 1, 236, 3108, 25, 1, 2451, 349, 500, 52, 8, 1517, 1435, 1993, 1098, 552, 12, 10, 25, 396, 1, 349, 2451, 2, 194, 5, 295, 5, 500, 12, 42, 15, 337, 2324, 482, 861, 4329, 674, 15, 241, 1793, 47, 1440, 2196, 307, 20, 16, 336, 336, 7, 4, 13, 639, 3580, 4, 87, 71, 128, 24, 639, 3108, 418, 2451, 17, 1, 102, 295, 1, 7, 6, 79, 16, 299, 47, 7, 597, 186, 6, 82, 44, 296, 228, 12, 7, 160, 428, 680, 3109, 7, 6, 12, 78, 73, 251, 18, 415, 347, 441, 1439, 984, 153, 7, 6, 12, 3109, 110, 119, 6, 12, 3, 10, 119, 12, 1, 15, 135, 64, 15, 1009, 187, 87, 1444, 15, 28, 100, 140, 254, 495, 4, 233, 101, 300, 528, 24, 2233, 277, 8, 1, 7, 110, 68, 220, 15, 1991, 366, 2452, 126, 769, 964, 199, 793, 4, 2383, 20, 296, 160, 1, 4, 87, 676, 329, 1335, 674, 943, 46, 558, 126, 37, 7, 1788, 3110, 99, 179, 3581, 817, 1133, 17, 1, 17, 552, 1098, 4, 54, 128, 24, 428, 7, 6, 164, 6, 199, 111, 77, 385, 4, 128, 78, 28, 132, 128, 10, 53, 489, 304, 6, 111, 27, 78, 46, 78, 6, 2566, 538, 247, 135, 46, 79, 5, 25, 1, 78, 2415, 639, 989, 500, 12, 1517, 1435, 654, 4, 6, 1298, 552, 12, 166, 2, 14, 25, 108, 29, 12, 224, 47, 40]"
187,7,"I just finished watching Frozen and there were many positives. To start, the visuals are truly stunning. I was amazed at how the artists played with the medium of snow or ice, which could be flat and white and boring, but in this film is exciting and beautiful. The story unfortunately seems to have been an afterthought, with all efforts expended on the polished music and animation (by comparison the story is a rough draft, and you have to wonder what the writer or writers were thinking.)The film rushes through emotions and events and expects the viewer to manufacture the appropriate feelings. I found myself unable to enjoy the ride as I usually do. Done right, this film could have made viewers gasp and laugh and cry. For me it did none of those things, I felt like I was trying to keep up...love, conflict, fear, resolution...the script bounces from one to the next and it doesn't make much sense. Even children's stories (even the most basic fairy tales, the little mermaid or the nightingale) have more depth and development. Even in other Disney movies, like Aladdin, we understand where feelings of inadequacy and greed and friendship and love are coming from. This movie was all about the neat tricks but lacking in the kind of substance that makes kids fall in love with stories and maybe even learn a little about them. It was enjoyable to watch but when the credits began to roll I felt disappointed. The master storytellers--so present in other animated films--were absent here. Kids are smart, and when we fail to grasp that, we do them a disservice.","['finish', 'watch', 'frozen', 'many', 'positive', 'start', 'visuals', 'truly', 'stun', 'amaze', 'artist', 'played', 'medium', 'snow', 'ice', 'could', 'flat', 'white', 'boring', 'film', 'excite', 'beautiful', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'seem', 'afterthought', 'effort', 'expend', 'polished', 'music', 'animation', 'comparison', 'story', 'rough', 'draft', 'wonder', 'writer', 'writer', 'think', 'film', 'rush', 'emotion', 'event', 'expect', 'viewer', 'manufacture', 'appropriate', 'feeling', 'found', 'unable', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'usually', 'right', 'film', 'could', 'make', 'viewer', 'gasp', 'laugh', 'cry', 'none', 'thing', 'felt', 'like', 'try', 'keep', 'love', 'conflict', 'fear', 'resolution', 'script', 'bounce', 'one', 'next', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'even', 'child', 'story', 'even', 'basic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'little', 'mermaid', 'nightingale', 'depth', 'development', 'even', 'disney', 'movie', 'like', 'aladdin', 'understand', 'feeling', 'inadequacy', 'greed', 'friendship', 'love', 'come', 'movie', 'neat', 'trick', 'lack', 'kind', 'substance', 'make', 'kid', 'fall', 'love', 'story', 'maybe', 'even', 'learn', 'little', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'credit', 'begin', 'roll', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'master', 'storyteller', 'present', 'animate', 'film', 'absent', 'kid', 'smart', 'fail', 'grasp', 'disservice']","[855, 23, 5, 61, 503, 120, 267, 329, 315, 96, 1886, 507, 1294, 39, 33, 54, 838, 365, 370, 3, 447, 93, 12, 573, 75, 3111, 575, 3582, 58, 21, 1126, 12, 2057, 2023, 532, 605, 605, 37, 3, 525, 240, 618, 131, 479, 3583, 1742, 680, 231, 1178, 91, 1305, 460, 130, 3, 54, 14, 479, 3584, 190, 505, 679, 43, 155, 9, 87, 154, 6, 552, 187, 1098, 395, 1969, 10, 418, 14, 31, 217, 28, 70, 12, 28, 1088, 219, 114, 48, 422, 609, 356, 28, 2, 1, 9, 485, 216, 680, 3112, 1003, 6, 40, 1, 4330, 3113, 273, 193, 1722, 14, 60, 186, 6, 12, 232, 28, 347, 48, 306, 23, 662, 160, 985, 155, 476, 1837, 4331, 663, 38, 3, 3114, 60, 1001, 1166, 3585, 4038]"
188,3,"If your like me, then you can never truly be disappointment with an animation movie, they all tend to be good with the majority being some of the best films ever, however, this wasn't the case for frozen! This movie wasn't appealing at all, if you have even the slightest problems with watching movies that are musicals, then you should avoid this one, because it is one giant MUSICAL! Right from the very get go of the movie you're hammered with musical after musical, which is extremely annoying unless you happen to be a 9 year old girl. Your left hoping that the musicals will end, if it wasn't for my girlfriend insisting that we finish watching it, I would have shut it off less then half way through. 40% through the movie they finally give you a break and lay off the musicals and finally get into some real storyline.The storyline itself was a drag, nothing exciting, around half way through the movie it becomes somewhat tolerable to watch.In closing, the plot and animation lacked anything worthwhile, even if musicals isn't a problem for you, you will still be walking away from this film, with the sense that it wasn't that great, perhaps good, but definitely not great. A storyline based around 2 princess's might be better suited for a younger female audience, definitely not a good movie for the family.","['like', 'never', 'truly', 'disappointment', 'animation', 'movie', 'tend', 'good', 'majority', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'however', 'case', 'frozen', 'movie', 'appeal', 'even', 'slightest', 'problem', 'watch', 'movie', 'musical', 'avoid', 'one', 'one', 'giant', 'musical', 'right', 'get', 'go', 'movie', 'hammer', 'musical', 'musical', 'extremely', 'annoy', 'unless', 'happen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'left', 'hop', 'musical', 'end', 'girlfriend', 'insist', 'finish', 'watch', 'would', 'shut', 'less', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'finally', 'give', 'break', 'lay', 'musical', 'finally', 'get', 'real', 'storyline', 'storyline', 'drag', 'nothing', 'excite', 'around', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'becomes', 'somewhat', 'tolerable', 'watch', 'closing', 'plot', 'animation', 'lack', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'even', 'musical', 'problem', 'still', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'sense', 'great', 'perhaps', 'good', 'definitely', 'great', 'storyline', 'base', 'around', 'princess', 'might', 'well', 'suit', 'young', 'female', 'audience', 'definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'family']","[9, 88, 329, 1038, 21, 1, 1913, 17, 1163, 34, 3, 81, 110, 514, 5, 1, 484, 28, 4332, 198, 23, 1, 51, 863, 10, 10, 1171, 51, 130, 19, 13, 1, 51, 51, 423, 238, 959, 290, 47, 64, 76, 330, 840, 51, 41, 2735, 3586, 855, 23, 26, 686, 321, 346, 50, 1, 241, 57, 340, 2704, 51, 241, 19, 195, 295, 295, 1045, 156, 447, 200, 346, 50, 1, 380, 572, 1914, 23, 2143, 52, 21, 273, 212, 1907, 28, 51, 198, 68, 669, 101, 3, 217, 25, 578, 17, 174, 25, 295, 256, 200, 29, 252, 18, 1355, 73, 237, 159, 174, 17, 1, 72]"

The animated film surprisingly entertains everyone, and by everyone I mean everyone. I wasn't expecting much because recently Disney seems to be falling out of hand from the shows on the Disney Channel to the movies recently released (not saying Brave or Tangled wasn't good, it just didn't quite melt the heart like the classics do. Aladdin, Beauty and Beast, movies of that sort). I must admit I even shed a tear, that movie was just beautiful, just beautiful.

192,1,"Boring film, or may I say musical.. big disappointment from Disney, dull plot and characters (in my personal opinion always) 1. Overrated animation. Animation was good but it came out in 2013, not 1950. From such a high budget film it could be even better but that's not really the point. 9/10 but overrated by many 2. Dull plot. Mostly like a barbie film with two princesses and 100% NOT a Disney classic. 3/10 3. Too much song. As mentioned above, this is a musical, not a film. It becomes boring after the first 15 minutes and keeps coming many times for no reason. ""Let it go"" does not fit in the movie at all, it was probably even made separated from the film but it needed promotion so they tried to fit somewhere. Music is supposed to be unnoticeable and is there just help you enter the atmosphaire, which ""Let it go"" failed to do. 0/10 4. Characters are BORING. No comment here. Olaf's a bit funny but that's it 6/10 5. Gives young children wrong impressions. All in all 3/10 but I expected a lot more because of its promotion and the fact that its from Disney so 1/10. ""Best movie of the year"" what? Wreck it Ralph was 10 times better and it was ignored by everyone. Just by spending half of the budget to promote the film doesn't make it good at all. 1/10.

193,3,"I guess I liked this movie, but it could've been better. The song ""Let it go"" is probably one of the most obnoxious songs ever. My problem for this movie are the lessons taught in the movie.1) the parents lock their daughter Elsa away from the world is just terrible parenting. Like who in their right might would tell their kids that they can't ever do anything for their childhood and have to be locked in their room. Wouldn't it make more sense to have Elsa explain her problem to Anna instead of shutting her out all of the time. 2) Elsa just ruined Anna's engagement with Hans. I get how she tells her that she can't marry another man, but did you really need to ruin her love life? A simple ""just date him for a while and see if you still love him"" would have been reasonable. Then runs away from her freezing everything problem like she's proving a point. Yeah when I am in a predicament, I run away from home to try to solve everything. Hmmmm.... doesn't that remind you of someone? ARIEL?? Both are bratty teenagers thinking it's okay to run away from home. 3) I like how everyone forgets how much of a jerk Elsa is when she sings that obnoxious ""Let it go"" song. Then everyone falls instantly inlove with her. LIKE WHAT??? She is an inconsiderate little b...to her sister their whole lives. The only reason why Anna saved you is because you had to ruin everything back at home. You froze everything. Not to mention that Elsa almost killed Anna twice. If I was Anna I would have let Hans kill that brat. She was nothing but trouble since the day she was born. 4) The ending of the movie. Everyone is all lovey-dovey when Elsa returns back home. Are you kidding me? She froze everything. Probably almost killed everyone because of her. Yet everyone is going to accept this psychotic b... as their queen. In real life, the people probably would have beheaded their queen. Disney once again says that everyone has a happy ending. No one gets punished or dies but falls inlove at the end. Everyone forgets about the villain, and happy music plays at the end. ""And they lived happily ever after"". Ugh nothing about this movie was fun to me. I guess little kids like this movie because of that skank queen and Olaf. I personally thought that Anna was the most influential character because she was so nice and litterily sacrificed her life for Elsa. What did Elsa do huh? Almost killed her sister twice and froze everything. I think that Anna should be more popular than her dumb, self-centered skank of a sister.I guess I made my point. I guess you could still watch it if you haven't, but I just wanted to poke holes in this movie that everyone says is so awesome because of the lessons that they teach.","['guess', 'like', 'movie', 'could', 'well', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'probably', 'one', 'obnoxious', 'song', 'ever', 'problem', 'movie', 'lesson', 'taught', 'movie', 'parent', 'lock', 'daughter', 'elsa', 'away', 'world', 'terrible', 'parent', 'like', 'right', 'might', 'would', 'tell', 'kid', 'ever', 'anything', 'childhood', 'lock', 'room', 'make', 'sense', 'elsa', 'explain', 'problem', 'anna', 'instead', 'shut', 'time', 'elsa', 'ruin', 'anna', 'engagement', 'han', 'get', 'tell', 'marry', 'another', 'man', 'really', 'need', 'ruin', 'love', 'life', 'simple', 'date', 'see', 'still', 'love', 'would', 'reasonable', 'run', 'away', 'freeze', 'everything', 'problem', 'like', 'prove', 'point', 'yeah', 'predicament', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'try', 'solve', 'everything', 'hmmmm', 'remind', 'someone', 'ariel', 'bratty', 'teenager', 'think', 'okay', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'like', 'everyone', 'forgets', 'much', 'jerk', 'elsa', 'sings', 'obnoxious', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'everyone', 'fall', 'instantly', 'inlove', 'like', 'inconsiderate', 'little', 'b', 'sister', 'whole', 'life', 'reason', 'anna', 'save', 'ruin', 'everything', 'back', 'home', 'froze', 'everything', 'mention', 'elsa', 'almost', 'kill', 'anna', 'twice', 'anna', 'would', 'let', 'han', 'kill', 'brat', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'since', 'day', 'born', 'end', 'movie', 'everyone', 'lovey', 'dovey', 'elsa', 'return', 'back', 'home', 'kid', 'froze', 'everything', 'probably', 'almost', 'kill', 'everyone', 'yet', 'everyone', 'go', 'accept', 'psychotic', 'b', 'queen', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'probably', 'would', 'behead', 'queen', 'disney', 'say', 'everyone', 'happy', 'end', 'one', 'get', 'punish', 'dy', 'fall', 'inlove', 'end', 'everyone', 'forgets', 'villain', 'happy', 'music', 'play', 'end', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'ugh', 'nothing', 'movie', 'fun', 'guess', 'little', 'kid', 'like', 'movie', 'skank', 'queen', 'olaf', 'personally', 'thought', 'anna', 'influential', 'character', 'nice', 'litterily', 'sacrifice', 'life', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'huh', 'almost', 'kill', 'sister', 'twice', 'froze', 'everything', 'think', 'anna', 'popular', 'dumb', 'self', 'center', 'skank', 'sister', 'guess', 'make', 'point', 'guess', 'could', 'still', 'watch', 'want', 'poke', 'hole', 'movie', 'everyone', 'say', 'awesome', 'lesson', 'teach']","[388, 9, 1, 54, 18, 11, 30, 13, 210, 10, 1717, 11, 81, 198, 1, 499, 1372, 1, 118, 382, 389, 4, 101, 126, 432, 118, 9, 130, 252, 26, 143, 60, 81, 212, 466, 382, 506, 14, 217, 4, 400, 198, 7, 208, 686, 20, 4, 851, 7, 1965, 44, 19, 143, 390, 102, 145, 22, 99, 851, 6, 79, 516, 927, 16, 68, 6, 26, 2188, 233, 101, 282, 132, 198, 9, 799, 117, 830, 4338, 233, 101, 533, 87, 1684, 132, 1047, 304, 1915, 1155, 37, 420, 233, 101, 533, 9, 109, 3588, 31, 2335, 4, 794, 1717, 30, 13, 11, 109, 186, 1498, 4339, 9, 48, 1569, 15, 127, 79, 180, 7, 111, 851, 132, 74, 533, 1916, 132, 348, 4, 173, 286, 7, 1227, 7, 26, 30, 44, 286, 4340, 156, 1073, 98, 138, 589, 41, 1, 109, 4341, 4342, 4, 385, 74, 533, 60, 1916, 132, 210, 173, 286, 109, 182, 109, 13, 869, 1569, 49, 195, 79, 46, 210, 26, 4343, 49, 2, 35, 109, 301, 41, 10, 19, 2935, 3589, 186, 4339, 41, 109, 3588, 104, 301, 58, 204, 41, 224, 795, 81, 2334, 156, 1, 125, 388, 48, 60, 9, 1, 4344, 49, 32, 520, 92, 7, 4345, 8, 192, 635, 79, 4, 4, 2737, 173, 286, 15, 1227, 1916, 132, 37, 7, 559, 1157, 429, 649, 4344, 15, 388, 14, 117, 388, 54, 68, 23, 59, 1794, 697, 1, 109, 35, 338, 499, 621]"

198,10,"Many have been touting this as Disney's best movie since The Lion King, and brings Disney back to its Renaissance era. Frozen gives us not one, but two incredibly strong female characters, while still appealing to both genders.The animation is amazing, especially with how complex some of the ice and snow scenes were. This is one of the few movies this year that is truly worth giving 3D a try. The music is also worthy of note. While not every song was perfect (a few seemed unnecessary and just a way to fill up time)""Let it Go"" should definitely be considered for nomination.No movie is perfect, and Frozen's plot and character development are its weak points. It is unfortunate that Disney decided to skimp on Elsa, the movie's most fascinating character. She is also the one with the most personal development from beginning to end. It would have been nice to see a darker or more chaotic tone, but this is a Disney movie, so it is expected to be light. The tropes of magic and true love also seem to be heavy handed, forcing the outcome in a predictable manner.Despite this, Disney still manages to make the audience care for most of the characters, most of whom are nicely fleshed out by the first act. By the time the movie finishes, you may even care a little or the snow man.With all this I think Frozen could compete with, and possibly beat, The Lion King as Disney's best movie. That may sound like a bit much, but its worth seeing it in theaters, at least one.","['many', 'tout', 'disney', 'best', 'movie', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'brings', 'disney', 'back', 'renaissance', 'era', 'frozen', 'give', 'u', 'one', 'two', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'still', 'appeal', 'gender', 'animation', 'amaze', 'especially', 'complex', 'ice', 'snow', 'scene', 'one', 'movie', 'year', 'truly', 'worth', 'give', 'try', 'music', 'also', 'worthy', 'note', 'every', 'song', 'perfect', 'seem', 'unnecessary', 'way', 'fill', 'time', 'let', 'go', 'definitely', 'consider', 'nomination', 'movie', 'perfect', 'frozen', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'weak', 'point', 'unfortunate', 'disney', 'decide', 'skimp', 'elsa', 'movie', 'fascinate', 'character', 'also', 'one', 'personal', 'development', 'begin', 'end', 'would', 'nice', 'see', 'darker', 'chaotic', 'tone', 'disney', 'movie', 'expect', 'light', 'trope', 'magic', 'true', 'love', 'also', 'seem', 'heavy', 'hand', 'force', 'outcome', 'predictable', 'manner', 'despite', 'disney', 'still', 'manages', 'make', 'audience', 'care', 'character', 'nicely', 'flesh', 'first', 'act', 'time', 'movie', 'finish', 'may', 'even', 'care', 'little', 'snow', 'man', 'think', 'frozen', 'could', 'compete', 'possibly', 'beat', 'lion', 'king', 'disney', 'best', 'movie', 'may', 'sound', 'like', 'bit', 'much', 'worth', 'see', 'theater', 'least', 'one']","[61, 2, 34, 1, 98, 152, 97, 509, 2, 74, 465, 942, 5, 57, 177, 10, 42, 603, 167, 237, 8, 68, 484, 1288, 21, 96, 121, 771, 33, 39, 90, 10, 1, 47, 329, 254, 57, 87, 58, 27, 790, 625, 115, 11, 175, 75, 845, 50, 481, 20, 30, 13, 174, 421, 1469, 1, 175, 5, 52, 8, 356, 434, 117, 1555, 2, 491, 4347, 4, 1, 1140, 8, 27, 10, 537, 356, 160, 41, 26, 192, 16, 1240, 4348, 627, 2, 1, 131, 735, 1032, 150, 62, 6, 27, 75, 1376, 323, 272, 1682, 331, 1377, 313, 2, 68, 825, 14, 159, 293, 8, 1231, 1620, 36, 112, 20, 1, 855, 171, 28, 293, 48, 39, 145, 37, 5, 54, 2738, 842, 1167, 152, 97, 2, 34, 1, 171, 259, 9, 95, 31, 254, 16, 312, 250, 10]"
199,4,"Frozen, the 2013 Disney ultra-hit had been floating around my peripheries since it was released. I would hear the songs everywhere, my friends would talk about it, I would watch parts of it on various screens in various places. By the time I sat down to actually watch the thing from beginning to end, I had thought I knew what my opinion would be. Frozen seemed like a riff on the classic Disney princess formula, an upbeat fairy tale with colorful characters and great music. However, upon watching it closely for the first time, I quickly developed an overwhelmingly negative reaction.My dominating thought? Frozen should have been made using hand-drawn animation. Despite the movie's many strengths, I found this notion impossible to get past. Watching Frozen is a mildly enjoyable, but ultimately sterile experience. Against the memorable songs, the computer animation feels bland, uninspired, and, pardon the pun, cold.The story is indeed a riff on the Disney formula, with princesses and magical kingdoms and goofy sidekicks. It's formally efficient, not really much different in structure from any other Disney princess movie. Frozen leans towards some kind of girl empowerment message (which critics unsurprisingly blew out of proportion with transparent praise), but not in any way that Mulan or Princess and the Frog or Pocahontas didn't. And all three of those films are much better than Frozen. Why? Because they felt alive. The voice actors do their best to prop up the missing verve. Idina Menzel is a very good singer, she helps. Josh Gad has an amusing moment or two as Olaf. Kristen Bell, for her part, tries very hard, but her skittish modern girl act gets tiresome quick, and straight-up annoying the longer it goes.But it's not the story or the voice acting that makes Frozen feel dull. It's the animation. I have to preface my opinion by saying that I am open-minded about the strengths of CG animation. Obviously, it can be done tremendously well. It can work in tandem with the right story. Frozen is just not the right story. It is a classic Disney musical. It is crying out for classic Disney animation. It needs the warmth, personality, and texture of animation made by hand. Without that special touch, something feels ""off"". It is designed to look like an old-school cartoon, but it isn't one. The entire movie exists on an uneasy point between realism and idealism. Why try to awkwardly replicate an art style in the computer when the tools are there to do it for real?This is a topic that really winds me up. I don't think it's impossible to make a nostalgic Disney movie using CG animation. It can certainly be done (Frozen shows the difficulty inherent in trying, but nevertheless). What I stand passionately against, is the belief that CGI should replace an entire separate art form. There seems to be a common belief that hand-drawn animation or ""2D animation"" as some call it, is technically obsolete, like fax machines or paper maps. Or that it's too expensive, so it should be phased out of existence completely (The fact that Disney themselves have led this charge is doubly maddening). Traditional animation is an art form. Done well, it has the exact same appeal today as it did in 1937. The same way oil paintings can still be uniquely beautiful even after the invention of the photograph. But don't tell the animation studios this. They are content with throwing the entire medium in the trash, as if they simply cannot afford to scare audiences away with a ""dead"" technology. But would Frozen have been any less of a box-office hit if it were frame by frame the same movie, only drawn by hand? Absolutely not. In fact, it'd almost certainly be a better film. A film with more personality and charm, with more energy and life.I totally resent people's compulsion to simply declare Frozen's animation ""beautiful"" without any solid reasoning. What does ""beautiful"" really mean? That the snow looks like real snow? That the ice shoots across the whole screen in elaborate patterns? What does the increased complexity of computer animation really add if it forsakes the important charms hand-drawn animation provides? For a movie like Frozen, the answer is, nothing.You're making a fairy tale. You need an artistic reason to animate it with computers. It can't be the standard. Frozen has no reason. It is technically proficient. You've got a story, characters, and music that basically work, but animation that does not. Just because CG animation exists, doesn't mean hand-drawn animation has to retire. In fact, if Frozen proves anything, it's that even some modern stories deserve the timeless personal touch of pencil on paper.42/100","['frozen', 'disney', 'ultra', 'hit', 'float', 'around',

203,8,"I'd say Frozen is worth your time. There are a lot of clever ideas to be seen in this spectacular effort which threw Disney back on top of the animation hierarchy after a slowly coming back with the previously released ""Wreck-it Ralph"", ""Tangled"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"". I at first fell into the ""hate it""-camp, but decided to watch it anyway to form my own opinion. I was positively surprised. I think the musical score has a the most memorable numbers to come out of the Disney company since ""Tarzan"". ""Let It Go"" is a catchy tune and even though it has been played to death it certainly deserves credit. The scene in which it is played is simply astounding. ""For the First Time In Forever"" serves the movie well, because it moves the story forward just like ""Do You Wanna Build a Snow Man"". That is the purpose of songs in musicals. I wasn't very keen on Olaf's and the Tolls' songs to be honest. The Trolls' song felt out of place and Olaf's did not add very much to the story.It was pleasant to have Olaf as a more quiet comic relief instead of loudly yelling ones from movies like ""Treasure Planet"" and ""Bolt"". Olaf's relationship obsession with summer was funny and had a good and heartfelt pay-off in the end. The animation is along with the music the highlight of the movie. It was beautiful, nothing more to say. The movie also makes fun of earlier Disney clichés like falling in love with one you just met. That is clever, and I enjoyed it all the way through. Sounds like a flawless movie? Think again! The villain is not good. Even though he explained his motivations which were decently clever, it felt forced. It was one of those last-minute villains. I think overall the hype has killed a generally well done movie. I think Frozen is good, but not among the greatest Disney animated movies.","['say', 'frozen', 'worth', 'time', 'lot', 'clever', 'idea', 'see', 'spectacular', 'effort', 'threw', 'disney', 'back', 'top', 'animation', 'hierarchy', 'slowly', 'come', 'back', 'previously', 'release', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'tangle', 'princess', 'frog', 'first', 'fell', 'hate', 'camp', 'decide', 'watch', 'anyway', 'form', 'opinion', 'positively', 'surprised', 'think', 'musical', 'score', 'memorable', 'number', 'come', 'disney', 'company', 'since', 'tarzan', 'let', 'go', 'catchy', 'tune', 'even', 'though', 'played', 'death', 'certainly', 'deserves', 'credit', 'scene', 'played', 'simply', 'astound', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'serf', 'movie', 'well', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'like', 'wan', 'build', 'snow', 'man', 'purpose', 'song', 'musical', 'keen', 'olaf', 'toll', 'song', 'honest', 'troll', 'song', 'felt', 'place', 'olaf', 'add', 'much', 'story', 'pleasant', 'olaf', 'quiet', 'comic', 'relief', 'instead', 'loudly', 'yell', 'one', 'movie', 'like', 'treasure', 'planet', 'bolt', 'olaf', 'relationship', 'obsession', 'summer', 'funny', 'good', 'heartfelt', 'pay', 'end', 'animation', 'along', 'music', 'highlight', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'nothing', 'say', 'movie', 'also', 'make', 'fun', 'earlier', 'disney', 'clich', 'like', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'met', 'clever', 'enjoy', 'way', 'sound', 'like', 'flawless', 'movie', 'think', 'villain', 'good', 'even', 'though', 'explain', 'motivation', 'decently', 'clever', 'felt', 'force', 'one', 'last', 'minute', 'villain', 'think', 'overall', 'hype', 'kill', 'generally', 'well', 'movie', 'think', 'frozen', 'good', 'among', 'great', 'disney', 'animate', 'movie']","[35, 5, 254, 20, 84, 691, 281, 16, 671, 575, 2236, 2, 74, 239, 21, 4355, 2743, 40, 74, 1870, 288, 352, 379, 83, 29, 659, 36, 843, 333, 3600, 491, 23, 497, 427, 258, 2379, 703, 37, 51, 223, 268, 184, 40, 2, 789, 98, 975, 30, 13, 266, 804, 28, 100, 507, 517, 442, 592, 662, 90, 507, 341, 1847, 36, 20, 287, 1866, 1, 18, 242, 12, 571, 9, 779, 202, 39, 145, 646, 11, 51, 2744, 32, 11, 742, 123, 11, 155, 188, 32, 269, 31, 12, 978, 32, 2459, 309, 297, 208, 3365, 3122, 10, 1, 9, 3123, 2237, 1951, 32, 153, 3124, 205, 85, 17, 1402, 963, 41, 21, 172, 58, 1358, 1, 93, 156, 35, 1, 27, 14, 125, 846, 2, 274, 9, 186, 6, 10, 392, 691, 91, 50, 259, 9, 1132, 1, 37, 104, 17, 28, 100, 400, 2035, 3601, 691, 155, 272, 10, 197, 211, 104, 37, 166, 406, 286, 1004, 18, 1, 37, 5, 17, 471, 25, 2, 38, 1]"
204,-,"Frozen is not the best Disney or Pixar movie by far but it is a very good movie and one of the best of recent years, it definitely deserves an Oscar compared to some of the other recent animated movies that have come out.The film is an animated movie version of Han Christian Andersen's story ""The Snow Queen"", however little of the finished film seems to be related to this story, it is more of just a jumping off point for the story tellers.The story is about two sisters, one who eventually becomes queen and one who is her younger sister, a princess. The Queen has the magical ability to make it snow and to make things frozen. It is a dangerous power she can't control and she ends up having to go off into the woods to live alone because she could kill everyone otherwise. Her sister Elsa goes off to find her leaving a stranger in charge (for some strange reason, why would she do this?) and meeting her love interest.The effects are great and it is a very good story, especially for children, but there are some logic flaws and it is just not quite good enough to be an excellent movie.

205,8,If you accept it for what it is (an animated fairy tale musical) it's actually pretty good. Disney Animation Studios who struggled with computer animation in their first films has finally matched Pixar in animation quality: the snow/ice environments are gorgeously rendered and the character animation is just excellent. Disney drew inspiration from Austrian/Scandinavian countries for the look of Arendell. The story is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Snow Queen'. There's also a good mix of comedy and drama with a great voice cast. Turns out Kristen Bell is not only beautiful but also has a great singing voice. I'm fairly certain the 'best original song' Oscar will go to Frozen.

207,6,"The new Disney animation, "" Frozen"" , combines classic elements of the genre: princesses, prince, love , singing, adventure , humor and a great challenge .Inspired by the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen , "" The Snow Queen "" , the movie is about the story of two sisters , raised in the same house, but separate . Anna , youngest, lived in every corner of the palace. Elsa, is older and owns a huge freezing power, was isolated from an early age by parents following a critical incident with her sister, who almost died frozen. After years of imprisonment, and the death of parents, Elsa's coronation as queen marks both the reunion of the sisters, as the beginning of the conflict such as the lack of power of the new queen . As a solution, Elsa search again their isolation , although Anna depart to their rescue ."" Frozen"" is a visual spectacle of colors , designs and plans agreed. Some characterizations of environments and characters , even remember much "" Tangled "" (2010 ) . The soundtrack is very good , although there are exceptions to the singing of the characters in some scenes . The secondary characters as comic relief work very well and help the narrative . And the scene where Elsa builds his new refuge and assumes his powers is a flawless beauty , one of the most well done scenes of Disney animation , match making with the outcome of "" Beauty and the Beast "" (1991 ) .The story , with a strong premise and well-balanced secondary resources, however, is not so well told . Despite the pro-activity of breaking with commonplace such as "" courtly (idealized) love "" Anna , or the fact that they are two princesses , princess and the main narrative is the brunette one, not the blonde one. Direction does not equates to the enormous job of writers (screenplay) to transform the ""Snow Queen"", of the fairy tale, in one of the first multi-dimensional characters of Disney princesses . The absence of building a relationship and more dialogs between the protagonists, added the option for the focus on Anna and their two (2 ) love interests, makes the movie shallow. There isn't a strong link between the sisters, after they grew up, harmonizing the outcome of the plot, or the discovery of Elsa then. Though the movie presents something less expected on the issue of "" true love "" , its appearance sounds forced. I get the impression that we have more involvement with the outcome because our memories of family and brothers, instead something that appears in the movie.Finally, I refer again to the "" Beauty and the Beast "" for a parallel . Beast and Elsa are the counterpoint , the hero and anti-hero. But in the first case , we understand and engage with the changing monster prince, but the second , I was feeling : nice, OK , it's doable (believable).

208,8,"While Pixar's animated movies are becoming more of a chore to watch, Disney has been making some good stuffs, be it the lovely Tangled or brilliant Wreck It-Ralph. With Frozen, they have surpassed their recent works. Frozen is a story of two sisters, one of whom happens to be in the possession of magical power. As they grow up and it becomes more difficult for the elder sister to control her powers, their relationship drifts apart, that once had been affectionate and loving. Disney has always been known for strong female leads in their stories. And Frozen is primarily a female driven story where the males are but in supporting roles. And its allegories to female empowerment and their vital roles in the society are touched with subtlety. In fact, one may very well reason that it is not about female empowerment at all. It is about sibling love and the burden of genius that is not to be feared, but embraced. But I beg to think differently. For me, Frozen is about how the society entraps the inherent power of the women by making them fear their own potentials. But then let us not talk about the message of the movie. Let each one interpret his own. Coming to the less subjective parts of the movie, Frozen has some of the best music that a musical has to offer. The songs are great. They are funny, witty and touching all at the same time. The one that plays in the beginning is quite reminiscent of The Lion King's powerful and intense Circle of Life. Secondly, the dialogues are a lot of fun. The animation is, as usual, colourful where ever it can be! Disney may be following the same old age formula of kings and queens, princes and princesses, magic and love, but it still manages to bring a freshness to its proceedings. Frozen may be inherently ancient in its setting, but in its tone it is very contemporary. This modernity is set up in its exchange of dialogues between the characters that manages to pick up the vibes and attitudes of our young generation. Actually, for once I thought they were going to do a Twilight here (I mean it in the good sense, not like the crap that the Twilight movie was), but they didn't. After all, it is essentially a kiddie flick and they need to keep things simple. Alas! The screenplay is fluid, moving at a comfortable pace with lots of fun, adventure and wit except for one place where I thought a revelation was bit jarring as it didn't seem to fit with what happened earlier. Frozen, a testimony to Disney's adaptability without sacrificing the soul, is your typical Disney musical fare, but let that not make you judge it poorly, as it contains enough of fun and innovation to keep you thoroughly entertained and the story relevant. This sibling love story is going to remain 'frozen' in your hearts for a long time.","['pixar', 'animate', 'movie', 'become', 'chore', 'watch', 'disney', 'make', 'good', 'stuff', 'lovely', 'tangle', 'brilliant', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'frozen', 'surpass', 'recent', 'work', 'frozen', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'one', 'happens', 'possession', 'magical', 'power', 'grow', 'becomes', 'difficult', 'elder', 'sister', 'control', 'power', 'relationship', 'drift', 'apart', 'affectionate', 'love', 'disney', 'always', 'know', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'story', 'frozen', 'primarily', 'female', 'driven', 'story', 'male', 'support', 'role', 'allegory', 'female', 'empowerment', 'vital', 'role', 'society', 'touch', 'subtlety', 'fact', 'one', 'may', 'well', 'reason', 'female', 'empowerment', 'sibling', 'love', 'burden', 'genius', 'fear', 'embrace', 'beg', 'think', 'differently', 'frozen', 'society', 'entraps', 'inherent', 'power', 'woman', 'make', 'fear', 'potential', 'let', 'u', 'talk', 'message', 'movie', 'let', 'one', 'interpret', 'come', 'less', 'subjective', 'part', 'movie', 'frozen', 'best', 'music', 'musical', 'offer', 'song', 'great', 'funny', 'witty', 'touch', 'time', 'one', 'play', 'begin', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'lion', 'king', 'powerful', 'intense', 'circle', 'life', 'secondly', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'fun', 'animation', 'usual', 'colourful', 'ever', 'disney', 'may', 'follow', 'old', 'age', 'formula', 'king', 'queen', 'prince', 'princess', 'magic', 'love', 'still', 'manages', 'bring', 'freshness', 'proceeding', 'frozen', 'may', 'inherently', 'ancient', 'set', 'tone', 'contemporary', 'modernity', 'set', 'exchange', 'dialogue', 'character', 'manages', 'pick', 'vibe', 'attitude', 'young', 'generation', 'actually', 'thought', 'go', 'twilight', 'mean', 'good', 'sense', 'like', 'crap', 'twilight', 'movie', 'essentially', 'kiddie', 'flick', 'need', 'keep', 'thing', 'simple', 'ala', 'screenplay', 'fluid', 'move', 'comfortable', 'pace', 'lot', 'fun', 'adventure', 'wit', 'except', 'one', 'place', 'thought', 'revelation', 'bit', 'jarring', 'seem', 'fit', 'happen', 'earlier', 'frozen', 'testimony', 'disney', 'adaptability', 'without', 'sacrifice', 'soul', 'typical', 'disney', 'musical', 'fare', 'let', 'make', 'judge', 'poorly', 'contains', 'enough', 'fun', 'innovation', 'keep', 'thoroughly', 'entertain', 'story', 'relevant', 'sibling', 'love', 'story', 'go', 'remain', 'frozen', 'heart', 'long', 'time']","[194, 38, 1, 179, 4362, 23, 2, 14, 17, 698, 765, 83, 523, 352, 379, 5, 1445, 399, 107, 5, 12, 42, 15, 10, 591, 4158, 170, 24, 285, 380, 1113, 1139, 15, 128, 24, 153, 2395, 512, 3610, 6, 2, 163, 56, 167, 237, 248, 12, 5, 2013, 237, 3126, 12, 431, 740, 371, 3097, 237, 1917, 4363, 371, 943, 260, 2401, 201, 10, 171, 18, 180, 237, 1917, 409, 6, 3068, 2036, 187, 1221, 2211, 37, 2155, 5, 943, 3595, 24, 251, 14, 187, 685, 30, 177, 178, 185, 1, 30, 10, 3127, 40, 321, 3611, 94, 1, 5, 34, 58, 51, 705, 11, 25, 85, 1216, 260, 20, 10, 204, 160, 124, 2149, 152, 97, 439, 2747, 2154, 79, 2656, 719, 84, 125, 21, 562, 3016, 81, 2, 171, 378, 64, 139, 534, 97, 49, 82, 29, 150, 6, 68, 825, 221, 3612, 5, 171, 2557, 3358, 144, 627, 1685, 4364, 144, 2461, 719, 8, 825, 1293, 2240, 1536, 73, 616, 103, 92, 13, 3613, 218, 17, 217, 9, 1114, 3613, 1, 1668, 2748, 805, 99, 154, 43, 516, 2749, 1027, 3128, 242, 3581, 564, 84, 125, 326, 1455, 474, 10, 188, 92, 1833, 95, 2241, 75, 560, 290, 846, 5, 2, 137, 635, 1074, 376, 2, 51, 1591, 30, 14, 1592, 1125, 1054, 164, 125, 154, 1243, 243, 12, 1335, 409, 6, 12, 13, 1436, 5, 80, 169, 20]"

210,8,"Since the release of Tangled Disney Animation Studios have been having a mini-revival under John Lassister and Frozen sees Disney goes for a full return to fall musical princess story.In the kingdom of Arendelle Princess Elsa (Idina Menzel) is born with the ability to create ice and snow. But when her powers cause her younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell) to have an accident and have her memory erased. After that her parents shut Elsa away and try to teach her to use her powers. When the king and queen die at sea Elsa has to become the queen and ends up loosing control of her powers at her ball in her honour when Anna announces she is engaged to Prince Hans (Santino Fontana). Anna sets out to find Elsa convince her to winter.The heart of the relationship and interactions between the sisters. Menzel and Bell were excellent together, they had the best songs, strong chemistry and their singing voices complicate each other, Menzel's powerful voice, to Bell's more higher pitched voice. Their songs particularly felt like Disney had their eye on a stage show, with one little line where Anna says Arendelle is in deep, deep, deep snow had a stage quality to it.Menzel is best known for her lead role in Wicked and Elsa does share some similarities. Both characters are isolated who are struggling to control their powers. Even the songs Let it Go and No Good Deeds have a similar tone and style.Olaf the Snowman played by Josh Gad was heavily promoted in the trailers and he seemed like he was going to be an annoying creation. He turned out to be a charming little character who did offer most of the jokes and humour for the film and does at least have a kind heart and meaning to princesses. The other areas of humour came from Anna being crummy and her interactions with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff).As you would expect from a Disney Animated film the animation is of a top level, with excellent character designs, the scenery and art direction and camera angles, movements and placement. There are some solid action sequences to also liven events up.Frozen starts at a brisk place, having an introductory song and there are five songs in the first five thirty minutes. The songs slow down after 'Let it Go', but I personally would have like more songs, particularly from Menzel and a little more from Bell. They two worked so well together and Menzel only sings in three songs. I would have preferred it if the film was a bit more like the Les Miserables film where there was constantly singing or at they be more songs during the running time.As a musical Frozen is strong, but at a plot it a typical Disney film and the plot points can seen coming from a mile off, especially in the final act.Frozen is an enjoyable film that fans of Disney animated films will enjoy and shows there is plenty of life in the Disney Princess genre and animated musicals.","['since', 'release', 'tangle', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'mini', 'revival', 'john', 'lassister', 'frozen', 'see', 'disney', 'go', 'full', 'return', 'fall', 'musical', 'princess', 'story', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'princess', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'born', 'ability', 'create', 'ice', 'snow', 'power', 'cause', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'accident', 'memory', 'erase', 'parent', 'shut', 'elsa', 'away', 'try', 'teach', 'use', 'power', 'king', 'queen', 'die', 'sea', 'elsa', 'become', 'queen', 'end', 'loose', 'control', 'power', 'ball', 'honour', 'anna', 'announces', 'engage', 'prince', 'han', 'santino', 'fontana', 'anna', 'set', 'find', 'elsa', 'convince', 'winter', 'heart', 'relationship', 'interaction', 'sister', 'menzel', 'bell', 'excellent', 'together', 'best', 'song', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'sing', 'voice', 'complicate', 'menzel', 'powerful', 'voice', 'bell', 'high', 'pitch', 'voice', 'song', 'particularly', 'felt', 'like', 'disney', 'eye', 'stage', 'show', 'one', 'little', 'line', 'anna', 'say', 'arendelle', 'deep', 'deep', 'deep', 'snow', 'stage', 'quality', 'menzel', 'best', 'know', 'lead', 'role', 'wicked', 'elsa', 'share', 'similarity', 'character', 'isolated', 'struggle', 'control', 'power', 'even', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'good', 'deed', 'similar', 'tone', 'style', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'played', 'josh', 'gad', 'heavily', 'promote', 'trailer', 'seem', 'like', 'go', 'annoy', 'creation', 'turn', 'charm', 'little', 'character', 'offer', 'joke', 'humour', 'film', 'least', 'kind', 'heart', 'meaning', 'princess', 'area', 'humour', 'come', 'anna', 'crummy', 'interaction', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'would', 'expect', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'animation', 'top', 'level', 'excellent', 'character', 'design', 'scenery', 'art', 'direction', 'camera', 'angle', 'movement', 'placement', 'solid', 'action', 'sequence', 'also', 'liven', 'event', 'frozen', 'start', 'brisk', 'place', 'introductory', 'song', 'five', 'song', 'first', 'five', 'thirty', 'minute', 'song', 'slow', 'let', 'go', 'personally', 'would', 'like', 'song', 'particularly', 'menzel', 'little', 'bell', 'two', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'menzel', 'sings', 'three', 'song', 'would', 'prefer', 'film', 'bit', 'like', 'le', 'miserables', 'film', 'constantly', 'sing', 'song', 'run', 'time', 'musical', 'frozen', 'strong', 'plot', 'typical', 'disney', 'film', 'plot', 'point', 'see', 'come', 'mile', 'especially', 'final', 'act', 'frozen', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'fan', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'enjoy', 'show', 'plenty', 'life', 'disney', 'princess', 'genre', 'animate', 'musical']","[98, 288, 83, 2, 21, 311, 2707, 2581, 1205, 5, 16, 2, 13, 246, 385, 186, 51, 29, 12, 77, 199, 29, 4, 141, 116, 589, 367, 134, 33, 39, 24, 328, 73, 15, 7, 162, 146, 480, 412, 972, 118, 686, 4, 101, 87, 621, 158, 24, 97, 49, 368, 1002, 4, 179, 49, 41, 937, 128, 24, 2243, 3129, 7, 2462, 619, 82, 44, 688, 665, 7, 144, 71, 4, 1444, 105, 80, 153, 1064, 15, 116, 146, 298, 332, 34, 11, 167, 1005, 63, 86, 979, 116, 439, 86, 146, 206, 2024, 86, 11, 536, 155, 9, 2, 336, 1115, 78, 10, 48, 213, 7, 35, 199, 574, 574, 574, 39, 1115, 283, 116, 34, 56, 248, 371, 678, 4, 781, 1736, 8, 782, 639, 128, 24, 28, 11, 30, 13, 17, 3614, 446, 627, 355, 32, 45, 507, 275, 257, 2053, 1829, 394, 75, 9, 13, 238, 1075, 113, 235, 48, 8, 705, 451, 732, 3, 250, 193, 80, 672, 29, 1266, 732, 40, 7, 1064, 67, 455, 377, 26, 131, 2, 38, 3, 21, 239, 440, 298, 8, 424, 1217, 749, 754, 3130, 2065, 886, 2694, 664, 345, 502, 27, 618, 5, 120, 3131, 188, 4366, 11, 731, 11, 36, 731, 4367, 211, 11, 1065, 30, 13, 520, 26, 9, 11, 536, 116, 48, 146, 42, 107, 18, 332, 116, 794, 433, 11, 26, 957, 3, 95, 9, 2066, 4368, 3, 1176, 63, 11, 233, 20, 51, 5, 167, 52, 376, 2, 3, 52, 117, 16, 40, 1784, 121, 817, 112, 5, 306, 3, 176, 2, 38, 3, 91, 78, 727, 79, 2, 29, 768, 38, 51]"
211,8,"I love Disney animated movies. My favorite being Beauty and the Beast. And when I saw the line in the Frozen trailer calling it the best movie since The Lion King, I was skeptical. And adding the fact it was starting to look a whole lot like Tangled, I was worried this movie wasn't going to be good. Now, I don't know about it being the best since The Lion King, but I really enjoyed and loved this movie.The movie is loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson story, ""The Snow Queen"". I never read it, so I can't compare the two, but I just thought I mention it. So, moving on from that. The plot was good. The first half was pretty standard. Exactly what you would expect from a Disney movie. The second half was what really made the movie. The plot twist I never saw coming. Especially, from a Disney movie. There was only two things I didn't really like about the plot. One being the ending felt rushed. And the second was that there was a few things that felt like they were just tossed into the movie. Some worked. Some didn't.The Music was great. It had a very Broadway feel to it. Do You Want to Build a Snowman? in the beginning gave you the back story of the main characters, Elsa and Anna, in a quick ad fun manner. Let It Go was by far the best and most memorable song in the movie. And there wasn't a song in the movie that didn't serve a purpose.And now to the characters. Frozen is about two princesses, Elsa and Anna. Elsa, the older of the two, is pretty much what you would think a princess would be. Minus the icy powers of course. Add in that secret and you get a great complicated character that I would've liked to dig deeper into. Anna, on the other hand, is more spunky, stubborn, and hot headed. I liked her a lot, also, just not as much as her sister. As for male characters, there's the Prince Has and the ice salesman, Kristoff. They were characters that fit what they were and they were fine. And they got better as the movie went on. Other characters were the reindeer, Sven, and the snowman who wants to live in summer, Olaf. They were more comedy relief than anything.Overall, I loved it. It was fun, enjoyable, and heartwarming. It even made me laugh at times. It wasn't perfect but what is? And plus, it fits the time of year. So what do I say? I say go and see this movie.","['love', 'disney', 'animate', 'movie', 'favorite', 'beauty', 'beast', 'saw', 'line', 'frozen', 'trailer', 'call', 'best', 'movie', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'skeptical', 'add', 'fact', 'start', 'look', 'whole', 'lot', 'like', 'tangle', 'worried', 'movie', 'go', 'good', 'know', 'best', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'really', 'enjoy', 'love', 'movie', 'movie', 'loosely', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'never', 'read', 'compare', 'two', 'thought', 'mention', 'move', 'plot', 'good', 'first', 'half', 'pretty', 'standard', 'exactly', 'would', 'expect', 'disney', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'plot', 'twist', 'never', 'saw', 'come', 'especially', 'disney', 'movie', 'two', 'thing', 'really', 'like', 'plot', 'one', 'end', 'felt', 'rush', 'second', 'thing', 'felt', 'like', 'toss', 'movie', 'work', 'music', 'great', 'broadway', 'feel', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'begin', 'give', 'back', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'elsa', 'anna', 'quick', 'ad', 'fun', 'manner', 'let', 'go', 'far', 'best', 'memorable', 'song', 'movie', 'song', 'movie', 'serve', 'purpose', 'character', 'frozen', 'two', 'princess', 'elsa', 'anna', 'elsa', 'old', 'two', 'pretty', 'much', 'would', 'think', 'princess', 'would', 'minus', 'icy', 'power', 'course', 'add', 'secret', 'get', 'great', 'complicate', 'character', 'would', 'like', 'dig', 'deeper', 'anna', 'hand', 'spunky', 'stubborn', 'hot', 'head', 'like', 'lot', 'also', 'much', 'sister', 'male', 'character', 'prince', 'ice', 'salesman', 'kristoff', 'character', 'fit', 'fine', 'get', 'well', 'movie', 'go', 'character', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'snowman', 'want', 'live', 'summer', 'olaf', 'comedy', 'relief', 'anything', 'overall', 'love', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'heartwarming', 'even', 'make', 'laugh', 'time', 'perfect', 'plus', 'fit', 'time', 'year', 'say', 'say', 'go', 'see', 'movie']","[6, 2, 38, 1, 189, 149, 203, 157, 213, 5, 394, 308, 34, 1, 98, 152, 97, 2750, 269, 201, 120, 66, 127, 84, 9, 83, 1800, 1, 13, 17, 56, 34, 98, 152, 97, 22, 91, 6, 1, 1, 696, 256, 44, 245, 467, 12, 39, 49, 88, 547, 350, 42, 92, 348, 242, 52, 17, 36, 346, 136, 633, 522, 26, 131, 2, 1, 319, 346, 22, 14, 1, 52, 129, 88, 157, 40, 121, 2, 1, 42, 43, 22, 9, 52, 10, 41, 155, 525, 319, 43, 155, 9, 3132, 1, 107, 58, 25, 411, 53, 59, 202, 45, 160, 57, 74, 12, 119, 8, 4, 7, 1191, 2463, 125, 1377, 30, 13, 142, 34, 268, 11, 1, 11, 1, 1173, 646, 8, 5, 42, 29, 4, 7, 4, 64, 42, 136, 31, 26, 37, 29, 26, 3070, 453, 24, 228, 269, 508, 19, 25, 979, 8, 26, 9, 1615, 1354, 7, 323, 1909, 2751, 1667, 317, 9, 84, 27, 31, 15, 431, 8, 82, 33, 1443, 67, 8, 560, 470, 19, 18, 1, 13, 8, 151, 181, 45, 59, 224, 205, 32, 279, 297, 212, 166, 6, 125, 306, 803, 28, 14, 190, 20, 175, 569, 560, 20, 47, 35, 35, 13, 16, 1]"
212,8,"There was a time not too long ago when it looked like Disney had lost its place as the premier animation studio in the world. The renowned Mouse House was churning out lacklustre, forgettable films that sank at the box office, just as Pixar was creating movie magic with films that were not just brilliantly animated but also boasted stories, characters and ideas that spoke more directly to audiences. In recent years, however, Disney has begun to regain its footing. Frozen can proudly join the ranks of The Princess & The Frog, Tangled, and Wreck-It Ralph as one of the most delightful animated movies in recent memory.In the markedly Scandinavian kingdom of Arendelle live two young princesses. Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel), the elder of the two, has powers over ice and snow. Anna (Kristen Bell) has no such magic, but is a sunny, cheerful child who adores her sister. Things go awry when Elsa accidentally knocks Anna out with a blast of wintry ice. Thereafter, Elsa resolves to put herself in cold storage (sorry) to protect those around her. Over the years and through the death of their parents, the two sisters become strangers. When Elsa loses control of her powers on the day she is due to be crowned queen, she flees to the mountains, and Anna must set out to bring her sister home again.Anyone hoping to see an accurate interpretation of Hans Christian Andersen's original fairy tale The Snow Queen should be forewarned. This is a Disney movie, after all, and so the malevolence of the titular Snow Queen has been scrubbed clean and replaced with Elsa's conflicted misery over powers that seem to be beyond her control. There are comedy trolls, sidekick snowmen, anthropomorphic reindeer and rugged mountain men – oh, and did we mention they all sing too? This is a Disney vehicle through and through.Crucially, however, this is a Disney vehicle with a bright, modern soul. On the surface, it looks like a disappointingly typical tale of swooning romantic love. Anna croons a jaunty song – Love Is An Open Door - with charming Prince Hans (Santino Fontana), and resolves immediately to marry him. She then spends much of the film in the company of forthright ice delivery dude Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer buddy Sven, both of whom risk life and limb to help her get to Elsa. Her dilemma is, of course, which handsome man will bring her everlasting happiness right?Dig a little deeper, though, and it's clear that Frozen is really about the far more empowering themes of family and self-acceptance. The real emotional pay-off in the film comes in the efforts made by both sisters to find their way back to each other, after years of tension and frost (of the metaphorical and literal variety). Many a Disney princess before Elsa and Anna have laboured under the notion that finding the right man will bring them their happy endings. Here, the twist on that old narrative chestnut is simple but results in a far more effective message for young girls: the right man, should you find him, will allow you to be who you want and ought to be. Even then, it's your job and your right to find your own happy ending.The magic and delight of Frozen is not confined solely to its more progressive message. It's also teeming with great characters. Anna is a spunky, determined chatterbox, brought to particularly enchanting life by Bell's quirky, more improvised moments in the recording studio. Elsa, too, is given enough scope to grow and shine in the role of the fiercely protective elder sister. Olaf the summer-obsessed snowman (Josh Gad), who came across as worryingly unfunny in the trailer, is a great deal more charming within the context of the entire film. The troop of trolls might feel somewhat like a narrative afterthought, but are adorable and crowd-pleasing nonetheless.It's heartening, too, to see Disney properly return to the musical format that made classics out of The Little Mermaid and Beauty & The Beast. The songs featured in Frozen – written by the song-writing team behind zeitgeist-y musicals Avenue Q and The Book Of Mormon – range from the blithely comic to the stirringly heartfelt. The decision to cast actors better known for their vocal prowess than their Hollywood celebrity pays off handsomely. Menzel tears into her confessional ballad Let It Go with her signature theatrical aplomb. Bell acquits herself wonderfully well too, especially in Anna's heartbreaking plea to a stonily unresponsive Elsa: Do You Want To Build A Snowman?. All in all, Frozen is a joy. There are moments when the film drags a little, and some character beats don't ring quite as true as others. But these are easy enough to forgive. In the larger scheme of things, Frozen looks absolutely gorgeous - witness Elsa's breathtaking construction of her ice palace in the mountains – and also brims over with heart and emotion. It's proof positive that Disney is back and, quite happily, better than ever.","['time', 'long', 'ago', 'look', 'like', 'disney', 'lose', 'place', 'premier', 'animation', 'studio', 'world',

216,1,"Let me start with the fairytale the book is based on. The movie is said to be loosely based on the book ""The Snow Queen"" from Hans Christian Andersen. Now everybody who has ever heard that story will agree that the movie has NOTHING in common with that story except the snow. The inspiration was probably the combination of snow and queen, thus the movie tells the story about snow and a queen, but that's it. Not even the names have been adopted. To be fair, the Snow Queen is probably one of the stories not really fit to be turned into a Disney movie, because the story is highly complex and deals with a lot of themes and topics. Disney should have just left it untouched! I know since a few years Disney made a habit about changing the original story a lot (see The Princess and the Frog/ dt. Küss den Forsch and Tangeled/ dt. Rapunzel) because these stories, too, would have probably not made a good Disney movie in their original form. However the characters were so charming and the music so amazing (in both German and English) that I was able to overlook it. However Frozen bring none of that to the table. I was highly disappointed for the story is badly written, or better there is hardly a real story there. There is a little bit of that a little bit of this and but no personal growth of the characters, no development of events. The storyline rushes from one thing to the other, no background is explained and suddenly the movie is over. What's even worse, the characters are superficial and lack any charm.

220,8,"Hey,I'll try to be as brief and informative as I can be, i'll start by recommending this movie, it's worth the watch and has a lot to offer: the visuals are fun and creative (you probably know by now that the effects on the ice are absolutely gorgeous), it has a number of fairly funny moments, and the first few minutes; i thought were very moving and well done. It addresses important aspects of human relations in a very smart way, while still being enjoyable for kids. Obviously one of the things the movie gets almost perfectly are the musical segments, every single song (except maybe the troll song, which wasn't by any means a ""bad"" song) were very well done, and succeeded in conveying the right emotions at the right time. (This is coming from someone who absolutely hates musicals and musical segments in movies). You might have heard that this movie has a feminist moral or something along these lines, be sure to ignore these comments and see for yourself, Disney simply did a very good job of writing a strong and attaching female character, I am very skeptical of any political agenda here. It's just a very fun and well made movie.It is also worth noting that Disney did take a risk by poking fun at some of their past material (i'd rather not explain in detail to avoid any kind of spoiling even minor) which explains some of the negative reviews it got from the hardcore traditional princess Disney fan base. With all this said here are a few minor complaints I have: I would say that the most legitimate criticism you could make would be the lack of depth in Elsa's character. Don't get me wrong though we do see her evolve at the beginning, but you simply don't feel like you know much about her by the end. Also she looked a little weird to me, something about the makeup they gave her, but that's a nitpick. It also has an obvious short, old, no redeeming quality, wig wearing villain which the movie could have done without in my opinion.Overall it does it's job very well with beautiful music, visuals and a very clever ending. It is most definitely worth your time.","['hey', 'try', 'brief', 'informative', 'start', 'recommend', 'movie', 'worth', 'watch', 'lot', 'offer', 'visuals', 'fun', 'creative', 'probably', 'know', 'effect', 'ice', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'number', 'fairly', 'funny', 'moment', 'first', 'minute', 'thought', 'move', 'well', 'address', 'important', 'aspect', 'human', 'relation', 'smart', 'way', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'kid', 'obviously', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'get', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'musical', 'segment', 'every', 'single', 'song', 'except', 'maybe', 'troll', 'song', 'mean', 'bad', 'song', 'well', 'succeed', 'convey', 'right', 'emotion', 'right', 'time', 'come', 'someone', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'musical', 'musical', 'segment', 'movie', 'might', 'heard', 'movie', 'feminist', 'moral', 'something', 'along', 'line', 'sure', 'ignore', 'comment', 'see', 'disney', 'simply', 'good', 'job', 'write', 'strong', 'attach', 'female', 'character', 'skeptical', 'political', 'agenda', 'fun', 'well', 'make', 'movie', 'also', 'worth', 'note', 'disney', 'take', 'risk', 'poke', 'fun', 'past', 'material', 'rather', 'explain', 'detail', 'avoid', 'kind', 'spoil', 'even', 'minor', 'explains', 'negative', 'review', 'get', 'hardcore', 'traditional', 'princess', 'disney', 'fan', 'base', 'say', 'minor', 'complaint', 'would', 'say', 'legitimate', 'criticism', 'could', 'make', 'would', 'lack', 'depth', 'elsa', 'character', 'get', 'wrong', 'though', 'see', 'evolve', 'begin', 'simply', 'feel', 'like', 'know', 'much', 'end', 'also', 'look', 'little', 'weird', 'something', 'makeup', 'give', 'nitpick', 'also', 'obvious', 'short', 'old', 'redeem', 'quality', 'wig', 'wear', 'villain', 'movie', 'could', 'without', 'opinion', 'overall', 'job', 'well', 'beautiful', 'music', 'visuals', 'clever', 'end', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time']","[1346, 87, 1661, 120, 262, 1, 254, 23, 84, 705, 267, 125, 1014, 210, 56, 278, 33, 292, 444, 184, 890, 85, 133, 36, 211, 92, 242, 18, 1595, 289, 443, 515, 1635, 1001, 50, 68, 306, 60, 613, 10, 43, 1, 19, 173, 456, 51, 3433, 115, 741, 11, 474, 232, 123, 11, 218, 65, 11, 18, 1101, 2190, 130, 240, 130, 20, 40, 304, 292, 333, 51, 51, 3433, 1, 252, 357, 1, 720, 551, 89, 172, 213, 207, 1079, 916, 16, 2, 341, 17, 373, 165, 167, 1764, 237, 8, 2750, 2142, 3080, 125, 18, 14, 1, 27, 254, 625, 2, 55, 1386, 1794, 125, 276, 1080, 191, 400, 468, 863, 193, 1056, 28, 670, 1497, 761, 161, 19, 4385, 462, 29, 2, 176, 256, 35, 670, 897, 26, 35, 4386, 1091, 54, 14, 26, 273, 609, 4, 8, 19, 280, 100, 16, 3623, 160, 341, 53, 9, 56, 31, 41, 27, 66, 48, 1063, 89, 4387, 57, 2320, 27, 595, 263, 64, 1199, 283, 4388, 1494, 104, 1, 54, 137, 258, 166, 373, 18, 93, 58, 267, 691, 41, 174, 254, 20]"

224,9,"""Frozen"" is a fantastic story about two sisters and the power of the love between them. It is about letting go, being yourself, and having faith in someone even though they don't have faith in themselves. All great messages for people to live by. The themes and moral are handled well through the film and not once does it become preachy or grating.The film is superbly directed with great attention to the script and character development. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee keep us on our toes by slipping in some smart humor and just as intelligently placed moments of true emotions. The film is paced pretty well, but in certain key moments, particularly the ending, it tends to rush through it. However, it's not rushed in a jarring way, but I did wish the film would slow down at certain points. A sharp script gives us well rounded characters and themes that we can all learn from. The two leads are given equal attention to and their relationship is handled incredibly well, especially in the intro of the film. The beginning of the film does a great job of introducing the characters and setting up their relationship. I was literally tearing up because of how real and honest the bond between the sisters were in the beginning and throughout the rest of the movie.Characters are great in this film. Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, is one of the two leads. She's probably the most awkward and quirky Disney princess we've ever had. She's a bit of a spazz, always tripping or bumping into things and fumbling over her words when she's nervous. It's quite cute and a joy to watch such an honest and real character. A lot of her flightiness comes from her being sheltered in a castle for such a long time with little interaction with other people. However, she's also determined and very open to meeting new people and helping her friends. Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel, the other lead is the complete opposite of Anna. She's more reserved and her actions are always calculated to a tee. She has magical powers, but due to an incident that happened when she was younger, she fears that people will loath her for her gift. She doesn't talk as much and usually prefers to be alone. The relationship between the two is really the highlight and it is heart breaking to see them rift away. One last character that I want to mention is Olaf. This character is probably the most worrisome part about the film for most people as Disney can sometimes be hit or miss with their side characters. However, here we have a huge hit with Olaf. He's a bit oblivious, but he's also incredibly likable and sweet. He gets some of the best lines in the movie and he's just a joy to watch because he doesn't try to steal the spot light from what's actually important. The rest of the characters are great and defined very well.The animation in the film is gorgeous. The characters move fluidly and the expressions on their faces are where some of the most intense emotions of the film come from. Elsa's magical powers are used well and there is both beauty and danger to it. The colors are vibrant and the use of blues and other colder colors really makes us feel the chills of the eternal winter.Like many classic Disney movies, this one is also a musical and a great one at that. The musical numbers are some of the best since the 90s films. Robert and Kristen Lopez did an amazing job with the soundtrack. The songs range from ballads to showstoppers to sincere to fun, but not one song feels out of place or stops the movies progression. My two favorite songs are ""For the First Time In Forever"" and ""Let It Go,"" both are powerful ballads that really give us a sense of what the characters are like and what they want. ""For the First Time In Forever"" is a duet between Anna and Elsa. I enjoy the contrasting lyrics as Anna is excited and Elsa is more afraid of her inauguration. ""Let It Go"" is the big show-stopping ballad about Elsa, finally liberating herself from her frustrations. Idina Menzels's voice is so powerful that I had goosebumps by the end of it. The rest of the songs are great as well and quite memorable with strong lyrics and powerful accompanying music. I bet you'll be humming and singing the songs long after watching the film.Overall, ""Frozen"" is a magnificent film filled with gorgeous animation, relatable and well-defined characters, toe tapping music, and a story that will melt even the coldest of hearts. Some people might be upset that their isn't a strong central villain in this film, but I think it is a plus because then we can focus on the struggles and strains between Anna and Elsa. It is easily the best animated film of 2013 and a future classic that we'll all watch over and over again. I give it 4.5/5, beautiful movie from start to finish.","['frozen', 'fantastic', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'power', 'love', 'let', 'go', 'faith', 'someone', 'even', 'though', 'faith', 'great',

226,-,"Most likely from my summary line, you have guessed that I wasn't thrilled by this Disney animated film. I hadn't watched one of Disney's (new) animated movies for a number of years, since I started to find them formulaic and repeating the same elements over and over. I only broke down and watched this one after hearing so much hype and praise for it for so long. And after watching it, I'm glad that I didn't shell out any money to see it (I got the Blu-ray from my local library.) I admit that it's not completely awful - the movie does LOOK good, with first rate animation as well as bright and vibrant colors. But the scripting leaves a lot to be desired. It's a pretty predictable (and very Disney) script, with plot developments and character actions that you'll likely see coming a mile away. And the comedy relief is bland at its best, and downright annoying at its worst. As for the songs, they all pretty much sounded the same, made worse by the constant forced rhymes and other clunky lyrical elements; even the Oscar-winning ""Let It Go"" is a disappointment. Any animated movie produced by Walt Disney during his lifetime is much better than this one (even ""The Sword in the Stone"" was better than this!) Incidentally, I heard that they are making a sequel to this movie. Oh boy, I can hardly wait.","['likely', 'summary', 'line', 'guess', 'thrill', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'watch', 'one', 'disney', 'new', 'animate', 'movie', 'number', 'year', 'since', 'start', 'find', 'formulaic', 'repeat', 'element', 'broke', 'watch', 'one', 'hearing', 'much', 'hype', 'praise', 'long', 'watch', 'glad', 'shell', 'money', 'see', 'get', 'blu', 'ray', 'local', 'library', 'admit', 'completely', 'awful', 'movie', 'look', 'good', 'first', 'rate', 'animation', 'well', 'bright', 'vibrant', 'color', 'script', 'leaf', 'lot', 'desire', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'disney', 'script', 'plot', 'development', 'character', 'action', 'likely', 'see', 'come', 'mile', 'away', 'comedy', 'relief', 'bland', 'best', 'downright', 'annoy', 'bad', 'song', 'pretty', 'much', 'sound', 'make', 'bad', 'constant', 'force', 'rhyme', 'clunky', 'lyrical', 'element', 'even', 'oscar', 'win', 'let', 'go', 'disappointment', 'animate', 'movie', 'produce', 'walt', 'disney', 'lifetime', 'much', 'well', 'one', 'even', 'sword', 'stone', 'well', 'incidentally', 'heard', 'make', 'sequel', 'movie', 'oh', 'boy', 'hardly', 'wait']","[1016, 1432, 213, 388, 1019, 2, 38, 3, 23, 10, 2, 108, 38, 1, 184, 47, 98, 120, 71, 2394, 1431, 401, 1802, 23, 10, 995, 31, 406, 535, 169, 23, 818, 2760, 661, 16, 19, 1081, 1030, 2761, 2366, 637, 291, 874, 1, 66, 17, 36, 694, 21, 18, 1425, 1596, 651, 395, 586, 84, 1070, 136, 331, 2, 395, 52, 356, 8, 345, 1016, 16, 40, 1784, 101, 279, 297, 811, 34, 1830, 238, 65, 11, 136, 31, 259, 14, 65, 2371, 272, 2762, 3628, 4397, 401, 28, 302, 374, 30, 13, 1038, 38, 1, 587, 410, 2, 2324, 31, 18, 10, 28, 1277, 2763, 18, 4398, 357, 14, 561, 1, 425, 408, 976, 415]"
227,1,"Frozen was without a doubt the most overrated movie over our millennium. The entire movie lacks tremendously. But why is it so overrated? Because general audiences and stupid kids don't need any kind of structure or bar for comedy and story. The formula for this movie was: Cliché princess story + pointless side characters + other pointless side character only made for unfunny quips and merchandise ÷ impressionable children and brainwashed parents = $$$$$$$$$. I cant stand Frozen, its everywhere to, after all these years I still see Frozen Socks, and Underwear. UNDERWEAR, why buy quality undergarments when you can buy a made in China piece of sackcloth with Olaf's face on it. The movie was bland and its only purpose was to make a quick paycheck to repay George Lucas for buying STAR WARS. Also, that wretched song ""Let it Go"" is the most overused ANNOYING song in cinema history, that's all I hear from kids these days, JUST SHUT THE HECK UP ALREADY. Its not even a good song. I especially hate Frozen because it has infiltrated every aspect of my life, I can go five seconds without seeing some brat carrying around an iPhone 7s with a Olaf phone case, or some little girl whining that she wants some stupid Elsa puzzle or a pair of socks with Anna's face plastered on. Disney saw big dollar signs and the demonic focus groups at Disney Animation Studios had no problem exploiting their primary demographic to the fullest extent possible and BEYOND. But the most disgusting abomination this movie has caused is the way it is being shoved into the general media.

229,8,"Walt Disney's ""Frozen"" takes us back to a time when animated films were literally royal affairs, overflowing with handsome princes and beautiful princesses, magic spells and comical sidekicks, Broadway-style songs and happily-ever-after endings. In this case, it's the Princesses who take center stage, and they're pretty resourceful and feisty, as befits the modern era.The story, based on ""The Snow Queen"" by Hans Christian Anderson, features Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) as royal sisters, the former of whom has magical powers, the latter of whom does not. The problem is that Elsa's use of her power is erratic, to put it mildly, and in an attempt to protect Anna from any possible fallout, Elsa has hidden that power from her little sister for most of their lives. On the day she is crowned Queen of Arendelle, Elsa inadvertently casts a spell on the world, plunging it into eternal winter. It becomes the job of Anna, with the help of some colorful assistants, to get Elsa to un-cast the spell and return normalcy to the world.With screenplay by Jennifer Lee and direction by Lee and Chris Buck, ""Frozen"" isn't the most cutting-edge of animated features, particularly in contrast to many of PIXAR better-known offerings, but it has an elegant, classical appeal that makes ""old-fashioned"" seem cool again. The score by Christophe Beck isn't instantly memorable but it at least it's more snappy than sappy, and the shimmering visuals compensate for a touch of spottiness in the storytelling.","['walt', 'disney', 'frozen', 'take', 'u', 'back', 'time', 'animate', 'film', 'literally', 'royal', 'affair', 'overflow', 'handsome', 'prince', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'magic', 'spell', 'comical', 'sidekick', 'broadway', 'style', 'song', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'case', 'princess', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'pretty', 'resourceful', 'feisty', 'befits', 'modern', 'era', 'story', 'base', 'snow', 'queen', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'feature', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'royal', 'sister', 'former', 'magical', 'power', 'latter', 'problem', 'elsa', 'use', 'power', 'erratic', 'put', 'mildly', 'attempt', 'protect', 'anna', 'possible', 'fallout', 'elsa', 'hidden', 'power', 'little', 'sister', 'life', 'day', 'crown', 'queen', 'arendelle', 'elsa', 'inadvertently', 'cast', 'spell', 'world', 'plunge', 'eternal', 'winter', 'becomes', 'job', 'anna', 'help', 'colorful', 'assistant', 'get', 'elsa', 'un', 'cast', 'spell', 'return', 'normalcy', 'world', 'screenplay', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'direction', 'lee', 'chris', 'buck', 'frozen', 'cut', 'edge', 'animate', 'feature', 'particularly', 'contrast', 'many', 'pixar', 'well', 'know', 'offering', 'elegant', 'classical', 'appeal', 'make', 'old', 'fashion', 'seem', 'cool', 'score', 'christophe', 'beck', 'instantly', 'memorable', 'least', 'snappy', 'sappy', 'shimmer', 'visuals', 'compensate', 'touch', 'spottiness', 'storytelling']","[410, 2, 5, 55, 177, 74, 20, 38, 3, 643, 870, 2765, 4404, 739, 82, 93, 29, 150, 858, 1785, 436, 411, 355, 11, 795, 81, 2441, 514, 29, 55, 649, 1115, 136, 1651, 324, 942, 12, 256, 39, 49, 44, 245, 467, 229, 4, 141, 116, 7, 162, 146, 870, 15, 1662, 170, 24, 955, 198, 4, 158, 24, 4405, 196, 1630, 448, 513, 7, 673, 4, 994, 24, 48, 15, 79, 138, 722, 49, 199, 4, 1274, 227, 858, 126, 2372, 310, 105, 380, 373, 7, 135, 1427, 4406, 19, 4, 2766, 227, 858, 385, 126, 1027, 464, 416, 754, 416, 526, 490, 5, 723, 1068, 38, 229, 536, 956, 61, 194, 18, 56, 1611, 2471, 1803, 484, 14, 64, 974, 75, 556, 223, 1357, 1307, 1498, 268, 250, 4407, 2175, 4408, 267, 3140, 260, 689]"

But how on earth is this so popular with adults? I thought maybe I don't get it because I've turned 30 or because I'm a man. But turns out my 26-year-old girlfriend hated it even more than I did. The story was so poorly built. There were so many plot holes and confusion, and it was sorely lacking in background and character development. And it seems instead of fixing that, they decided to put in a bunch of mediocre songs. Half the movie was just singing.The worst part was that Idina Menzel, playing Anna, completely botched the one scene that could have been epic. Her voice is so strained and forced at the high notes it actually sounds painful, not at all what I've come to expect from Disney actors. It was difficult to listen to and ruined the scenes. How she got this part is beyond me; she doesn't have the range to sing these songs, and she's not even a famous name.This is NOT in the same league as the old Disney classics. In fact, it is one of the worst Disney movies I've seen: bad story, bad actor (just Idina Menzel), and the dullest songs I've ever heard in a musical.","['baffle', 'sure', 'kid', 'like', 'particular', 'movie', 'pretty', 'magical', 'compromise', 'give', 'five', 'earth', 'popular', 'adult', 'thought', 'maybe', 'get', 'turn', 'man', 'turn', 'year', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'hat', 'even', 'story', 'poorly', 'built', 'many', 'plot', 'hole', 'confusion', 'sorely', 'lack', 'background', 'character', 'development', 'seem', 'instead', 'fix', 'decide', 'put', 'bunch', 'mediocre', 'song', 'half', 'movie', 'sing', 'bad', 'part', 'idina', 'menzel', 'play', 'anna', 'completely', 'botch', 'one', 'scene', 'could', 'epic', 'voice', 'strain', 'force', 'high', 'note', 'actually', 'sound', 'painful', 'come', 'expect', 'disney', 'actor', 'difficult', 'listen', 'ruin', 'scene', 'get', 'part', 'beyond', 'range', 'sing', 'song', 'even', 'famous', 'name', 'league', 'old', 'disney', 'classic', 'fact', 'one', 'bad', 'disney', 'movie', 'see', 'bad', 'story', 'bad', 'actor', 'idina', 'menzel', 'dullest', 'song', 'ever', 'heard', 'musical']","[2610, 207, 60, 9, 650, 1, 136, 170, 3141, 57, 731, 1776, 559, 147, 92, 232, 19, 113, 145, 113, 47, 64, 2735, 606, 28, 12, 1125, 787, 61, 52, 697, 2767, 4249, 273, 617, 8, 356, 75, 208, 1012, 491, 196, 1211, 752, 11, 346, 1, 63, 65, 94, 141, 116, 204, 7, 291, 10, 90, 54, 566, 86, 2033, 272, 206, 625, 103, 259, 2018, 40, 131, 2, 518, 1113, 531, 851, 90, 19, 94, 614, 958, 63, 11, 28, 903, 183, 2592, 64, 2, 69, 201, 10, 65, 2, 1, 16, 65, 12, 65, 518, 141, 116, 11, 81, 357, 51]"

244,7,"Perhaps the biggest flaw of Disney's new musical, Frozen, is the music. More specifically, it's the songs. None of them are memorable, at least not in the same manner as those from films like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. The characters sing to cheesy percussion in songs that sound prepared more for the Disney Channel than a Disney movie. In one instance, a main character looks directly into the audience as she belts out her big tune. That was the moment that I realized the musical numbers were individual music videos tacked onto an otherwise fine film.And, really, there isn't a whole lot to complain about with Frozen. The animation is absolutely gorgeous. rivaling last year's Pixar offering, Brave, for the award for Best Animated Landscapes. It also goes a long way to distance itself from other animated films featuring a bored or discontent heroine who wants to be independent. In fact, the lessons of Frozen all involve selflessness and sacrifice, a welcome change after the narcissistic Brave. The story is a Disney retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen,"" in which we find protective older sister Princess Elsa (Idina Menzel), who was born with the special power to conjure ice, distancing herself from younger sister Princess Anna (Kristen Bell) after a childhood accident forced their parents to hide Elsa's secret.Elsa's secret eventually comes to life when she is crowned queen, and in an attempt to isolate herself, she inadvertently covers the kingdom in perpetual winter. At that point, it is up to Anna, her fiancé Prince Hans, and hunky mountain man Kristoff to save the day.Frozen is brimming with excellent supporting characters, from a goofy Scandinavian sauna proprietor to the lovable living snowman Olaf (expertly voiced by Josh Gad). Olaf is easily the most enjoyable animated character since Dory in Finding Nemo, and like that character, the filmmakers use his comic relief only enough to balance out some of the drama. That is to say, Olaf never becomes Jar Jar Binks. They could have devoted the whole film to him and I would be a repeat viewer.Still, Disney's latest offering is far from perfect. Things wrap up far too easily after too much exposition at the beginning. Characters are introduced and barely heard from again (a magic group of trolls comes to mind). I have the feeling that without the radio-ready pop songs, more time could have been spent on fleshing out the margins of the story and providing an even more unique vision within the Disney universe. Menzel and Bell are perfectly pleasant in their voice work, but their huge duets spiral down into ""Dueling Vibratos."" It's good that Disney is tearing down its own ""princess"" stereotypes of late, and Frozen strikes the right balance of not making its heroines dependent upon anyone but each other. If only it could have found a way to reconcile its great characters with its mostly awful tunes, we may have held Frozen as one for the ages.","['perhaps', 'big', 'flaw', 'disney', 'new', 'musical', 'frozen', 'music', 'specifically', 'song', 'none', 'memorable', 'least', 'manner', 'film', 'like', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'character', 'sing', 'cheesy', 'percussion', 'song', 'sound', 'prepared', 'disney', 'channel', 'disney', 'movie', 'one', 'instance', 'main', 'character', 'look', 'directly', 'audience', 'belt', 'big', 'tune', 'moment', 'realize', 'musical', 'number', 'individual', 'music', 'video', 'tacked', 'onto', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'film', 'really', 'whole', 'lot', 'complain', 'frozen', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'rival', 'last', 'year', 'pixar', 'offering', 'brave', 'award', 'best', 'animate', 'landscape', 'also', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'distance', 'animate', 'film', 'feature', 'bore', 'discontent', 'heroine', 'want', 'independent', 'fact', 'lesson', 'frozen', 'involve', 'selflessness', 'sacrifice', 'welcome', 'change', 'narcissistic', 'brave', 'story', 'disney', 'retell', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'find', 'protective', 'old', 'sister', 'princess', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'born', 'special', 'power', 'conjure', 'ice', 'distance', 'young', 'sister', 'princess', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'childhood', 'accident', 'force', 'parent', 'hide', 'elsa', 'secret', 'elsa', 'secret', 'eventually', 'come', 'life', 'crown', 'queen', 'attempt', 'isolate', 'inadvertently', 'cover', 'kingdom', 'perpetual', 'winter', 'point', 'anna', 'fianc', 'prince', 'han', 'hunky', 'mountain', 'man', 'kristoff', 'save', 'day', 'frozen', 'brimming', 'excellent', 'support', 'character', 'goofy', 'scandinavian', 'sauna', 'proprietor', 'lovable', 'living', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'expertly', 'voiced', 'josh', 'gad', 'olaf', 'easily', 'enjoyable', 'animate', 'character', 'since', 'dory', 'find', 'nemo', 'like', 'character', 'filmmaker', 'use', 'comic', 'relief', 'enough', 'balance', 'drama', 'say', 'olaf', 'never', 'becomes', 'jar', 'jar', 'binks', 'could', 'devote', 'whole', 'film', 'would', 'repeat', 'viewer', 'still', 'disney', 'late', 'offering', 'far', 'perfect', 'thing', 'wrap', 'far', 'easily', 'much', 'exposition', 'begin', 'character', 'introduce', 'barely', 'heard', 'magic', 'group', 'troll', 'come', 'mind', 'feel', 'without', 'radio', 'ready', 'pop', 'song', 'time', 'could', 'spent', 'flesh', 'margin', 'story', 'provide', 'even', 'unique', 'vision', 'within', 'disney', 'universe', 'menzel', 'bell', 'perfectly', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'work', 'huge', 'duet', 'spiral', 'duel', 'vibrato', 'good', 'disney', 'tear', 'princess', 'stereotype', 'late', 'frozen', 'strike', 'right', 'balance', 'make', 'heroine', 'dependent', 'upon', 'anyone', 'could', 'found', 'way', 'reconcile', 'great', 'character', 'mostly', 'awful', 'tune', 'may', 'held', 'frozen', 'one', 'age']","[578, 106, 386, 2, 108, 51, 5, 58, 1828, 11, 679, 268, 250, 1377, 3, 9, 149, 203, 152, 97, 8, 63, 922, 11, 259, 1964, 2, 2613, 2, 1, 10, 1758, 119, 8, 66, 2210, 159, 1276, 106, 804, 133, 428, 51, 184, 1921, 58, 970, 2584, 1922, 827, 470, 3, 22, 127, 84, 1460, 5, 21, 292, 444, 1487, 197, 47, 194, 1611, 335, 469, 34, 38, 889, 27, 13, 169, 50, 1486, 38, 3, 229, 604, 565, 59, 1058, 201, 499, 5, 584, 635, 1108, 209, 335, 12, 2, 2250, 44, 245, 339, 39, 49, 71, 2757, 64, 15, 29, 4, 141, 116, 589, 316, 24, 2156, 33, 1486, 73, 15, 29, 7, 162, 146, 466, 480, 272, 118, 676, 4, 508, 4, 508, 652, 40, 79, 722, 49, 448, 1438, 1274, 712, 77, 1437, 105, 117, 7, 1331, 82, 44, 3147, 214, 145, 67, 111, 138, 5, 298, 740, 8, 961, 1089, 726, 704, 45, 32, 3638, 521, 275, 257, 32, 403, 306, 38, 8, 98, 4417, 71, 1411, 9, 8, 2403, 158, 309, 297, 164, 677, 745, 35, 32, 88, 380, 1007, 1007, 1887, 54, 2774, 127, 3, 26, 1431, 479, 68, 2, 530, 1611, 142, 175, 43, 1735, 142, 403, 31, 1739, 160, 8, 736, 944, 357, 150, 849, 123, 40, 320, 53, 137, 2421, 1289, 658, 11, 20, 54, 992, 1620, 12, 458, 28, 414, 2775, 654, 2, 2474, 116, 146, 456, 978, 86, 107, 360, 1513, 2435, 4161, 17, 2, 748, 29, 2001, 530, 5, 1193, 130, 677, 14, 565, 2776, 554, 299, 54, 231, 50, 1923, 25, 8, 567, 874, 804, 171, 1512, 5, 10, 139]"
245,7,"Frozen, which launched in theaters on November 29, 2013 and brought in an estimated $67 million during its opening weekend, has certainly been a hit with both kids and parents. The driving theme in Frozen is the relationship between sisters. While a love story is woven into the mix, the movie is ultimately about the love of sisters, Elsa and Anna. This Disney princess movie debunks the myth that love can be found overnight. The naïve young Anna accepts a marriage proposal from a man she met earlier that day. Anna's sister Elsa, a newly crowned queen, will not bless the marriage. In her rage, Elsa exposes her winter powers that have kept the sisters locked away in a castle for so many years. Elsa's powers make her appear unfit to be queen of Arendelle and the people believe her to be a dangerous sorcerer, and Elsa flees the castle to avoid hurting anyone. Searching for the answer to her sister's strange outburst and solitary childhood, Ana journeys to find her sister and bring her back to Arendelle. Along the way, she befriends a man who helps her through the icy climate to find Elsa and end the eternal winter. Frozen was not a stereotypical Disney Princess movie. While, romance is a part of this movie, the most notable relationship is the relationship between Elsa and Anna. Their sisterhood is set up at the opening, and it continues to pull at the heartstrings of the audience throughout the film. The characters in Frozen are distinct from one another, which makes the relationships more interesting. Elsa is the independent older sister who has hidden herself away for most of her life to protect her sister for most of her life. Anna is childlike even as an adult character but strong and capable. The artistry in this animation is also notable. It was shown in both 2D and 3D. Frozen had crisp graphics, and the backdrops appeared more life-like than animated. The characters looked like they were walking through a realistic set. There were two characters that did not fully fit in this movie: Olaf, the happy-go-lucky snowman, and the Duke of Weselton, a power hungry trader that wants to portray the queen as a monster. Olaf's character was visually out of place with the rest of the characters. It was a good idea to bring the sisters together with the snowman from their childhood, but this character did not work visually. Besides Olaf the snowman, the characters in Frozen were animated beautifully and looked good with the realistic set however Olaf appeared as something out of a typical Saturday morning cartoon, not a major motion picture. The Duke of Weselton was only in the movie for a few brief parts, and he made the audience think that he was the bad guy. But in the end he the audience finds that he has no real importance to the plot. Frozen shows a definite change in Disney princess movies. We got a first glimpse of this transition in the animated Disney princess movie, Brave. Disney seems to be shifting the values of its princess movies from forbidden young love to family love. Frozen had two Academy Award nominations for best animated film and best original song, a Golden Globe for best animated feature film, and ten Annie Award nominations. Frozen is another Disney Princess instant classic, and is something both kids and adults can enjoy. However, it would be just as pleasing and cheaper to wait until it comes out on video to watch. Even for a little girl who loves princesses, the six year old that I took to this movie had forgotten about it a few days later.","['frozen', 'launch', 'theater', 'november', 'brought', 'estimate', 'million', 'opening', 'weekend', 'certainly', 'hit', 'kid', 'parent', 'drive', 'theme', 'frozen', 'relationship', 'sister', 'love', 'story', 'woven', 'mix', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'love', 'sister', 'elsa', 'anna', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'debunks', 'myth', 'love', 'found', 'overnight', 'na', 'young', 'anna', 'accepts', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'man', 'met', 'earlier', 'day', 'anna', 'sister', 'elsa', 'newly', 'crown', 'queen', 'bless', 'marriage', 'rage', 'elsa', 'expose', 'winter', 'power', 'kept', 'sister', 'lock', 'away', 'castle', 'many', 'year', 'elsa', 'power', 'make', 'appear', 'unfit', 'queen', 'arendelle', 'people', 'believe', 'dangerous', 'sorcerer', 'elsa', 'flees', 'castle', 'avoid', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'search', 'answer', 'sister', 'strange', 'outburst', 'solitary', 'childhood', 'ana', 'journey', 'find', 'sister', 'bring', 'back', 'arendelle', 'along', 'way', 'befriends', 'man', 'help', 'icy', 'climate', 'find', 'elsa', 'end', 'eternal', 'winter', 'frozen', 'stereotypical', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'romance', 'part', 'movie', 'notable', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'elsa', 'anna', 'sisterhood', 'set', 'opening', 'continue', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'audience', 'throughout', 'film', 'character', 'frozen', 'distinct', 'one', 'another', 'make', 'relationship', 'interest', 'elsa', 'independent', 'old', 'sister', 'hidden', 'away', 'life', 'protect', 'sister', 'life', 'anna', 'childlike', 'even', 'adult', 'character', 'strong', 'capable', 'artistry', 'animation', 'also', 'notable', 'show', 'frozen', 'crisp', 'graphic', 'backdrop', 'appear', 'life', 'like', 'animate', 'character', 'look', 'like', 'walk', 'realistic', 'set', 'two', 'character', 'fully', 'fit', 'movie', 'olaf', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'snowman', 'duke', 'weselton', 'power', 'hungry', 'trader', 'want', 'portray', 'queen', 'monster', 'olaf', 'character', 'visually', 'place', 'rest', 'character', 'good', 'idea', 'bring', 'sister', 'together', 'snowman', 'childhood', 'character', 'work', 'visually', 'besides', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'character', 'frozen', 'animate', 'beautifully', 'look', 'good', 'realistic', 'set', 'however', 'olaf', 'appear', 'something', 'typical', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'duke', 'weselton', 'movie', 'brief', 'part', 'make', 'audience', 'think', 'bad', 'guy', 'end', 'audience', 'find', 'real', 'importance', 'plot', 'frozen', 'show', 'definite', 'change', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'get', 'first', 'glimpse', 'transition', 'animate', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'brave', 'disney', 'seem', 'shift', 'value', 'princess', 'movie', 'forbidden', 'young', 'love', 'family', 'love', 'frozen', 'two', 'academy', 'award', 'nomination', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'best', 'original', 'song', 'golden', 'globe', 'best', 'animate', 'feature', 'film', 'ten', 'annie', 'award', 'nomination', 'frozen', 'another', 'disney', 'princess', 'instant', 'classic', 'something', 'kid', 'adult', 'enjoy', 'however', 'would', 'please', 'cheaper', 'wait', 'come', 'video', 'watch', 'even', 'little', 'girl', 'love', 'princess', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'take', 'movie', 'forgotten', 'day', 'later']","[5, 3639, 312, 1581, 599, 965, 631, 2010, 442, 234, 60, 118, 1192, 226, 5, 153, 15, 6, 12, 3148, 1119, 1, 941, 6, 15, 4, 7, 2, 29, 1, 4418, 6, 231, 4419, 2777, 73, 7, 2173, 1057, 3149, 145, 392, 846, 138, 7, 15, 4, 1587, 722, 49, 2423, 1057, 2069, 4, 1318, 105, 24, 498, 15, 382, 101, 168, 61, 47, 4, 24, 14, 582, 49, 199, 46, 220, 702, 3640, 4, 710, 168, 863, 305, 299, 793, 1145, 15, 980, 2449, 2778, 466, 929, 337, 71, 15, 221, 74, 199, 172, 50, 3426, 145, 135, 453, 2475, 71, 4, 41, 310, 105, 5, 1567, 2, 29, 1, 363, 94, 1, 1805, 153, 153, 4, 7, 861, 144, 631, 647, 695, 159, 296, 3, 8, 5, 3570, 10, 102, 14, 153, 122, 4, 1058, 64, 15, 994, 101, 79, 513, 15, 79, 7, 3150, 28, 147, 8, 167, 1924, 2630, 21, 27, 1805, 78, 5, 3641, 714, 1821, 582, 79, 9, 38, 8, 66, 9, 669, 640, 144, 42, 8, 822, 560, 1, 32, 301, 13, 1598, 45, 762, 1233, 24, 2687, 1756, 59, 1018, 49, 495, 32, 8, 585, 188, 303, 8, 17, 281, 221, 15, 332, 45, 466, 8, 107, 585, 877, 32, 45, 8, 5, 38, 529, 66, 17, 640, 144, 110, 32, 582, 89, 376, 2779, 2476, 314, 823, 1507, 438, 762, 1233, 1, 1661, 94, 14, 159, 37, 65, 148, 41, 159, 71, 195, 1259, 52, 5, 78, 2131, 209, 2, 29, 1, 19, 36, 2558, 1740, 38, 2, 29, 1, 335, 2, 75, 1967, 728, 29, 1, 3151, 73, 6, 72, 6, 5, 42, 856, 469, 1469, 34, 38, 3, 34, 230, 11, 796, 1521, 34, 38, 229, 3, 829, 469, 1469, 5, 102, 2, 29, 982, 69, 89, 60, 147, 91, 110, 26, 576, 415, 40, 970, 23, 28, 48, 76, 6, 29, 1879, 47, 64, 55, 1, 1017, 138, 358]"
246,-,"Quite possibly one of Disney's best, esp. considering that it's been a long time in the making, this adaptation of 'The snow queen' is a nice little throwback, that 'Tangled' and 'The princess and the frog' set out to achieve earlier without (much, esp. of the rousing kind) success. Well-etched characters, a good screenplay, retaining tried- and-tested formulae without making it seem like re-treads, this one's a keeper (and oh, I'm choosing to ignore a couple of plot-holes along the way). Loved the tracks 'Let it go' (the movie-sequence one more than the version rendered during the end-credits), 'Do you want to build a snowman', and 'In summer'.Missed the post-credits sequence (was not aware there was gonna be one), so others reading this can wait and listen to Demi Lovato render 'Let it go' (and compare it with Idina Menzel's own) before it comes on (the Marvel takeover seems to have 'influenced' Disney for these kinda sequences, huh?).(On my 2nd viewing, I waited all the way until all the credits were done, just to have the projectionist in PVR Bengaluru Audi 9 switch it off, leaving the video on, so that our imagination could fill in the gaps)Got to watch it on 3D with Dolby Atmos, so there was that. Might end up watching it once again, since I'm traveling next week. Btw, this one needs 3D viewing, and the excess ticket fare IS justified, so go for it.FYI, the BW Mickey Mouse sequence (pre-title), though not laugh-out-loud hilarious, is cute, and seems to portend a new direction for Mickey and gang (including Big Bad Pete, though a vvvv imp character is missed). Developments awaited...

Those magical powers could be harmfull to others because she can't completely control them. That's all I'm gonna say about the story...The story is simple but well written and it doesn't feel like it's been done a million times before. The characters are interesting and lovable and the animations is beautiful.Almost forgot to say: this movie is a musical, but it works, they girls sing their feelings to each other and it just simply works. The songs are all at least more then decent and performed well.The only two things I'd like to comment on are these: the movie is too beautiful, the animation is just too smooth, the princesses are too pretty and the potential love interests off the two are too handsome. It feels too fake and it would've benefit the movie if it felt more real. Yes, even an animated movie benefits from some down-to-earth-ness. Second, it could've been a little funnier. Especially the opening where the story and characters are introduced was a bit boring. After that it got better and better. One of the few Disney movies where the ending was good and didn't feel completely predictable either.","['wan', 'short', 'story', 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'basically', 'two', 'sister', 'princess', 'one', 'magical', 'power', 'magical', 'power', 'could', 'harmfull', 'others', 'completely', 'control', 'gon', 'say', 'story', 'story', 'simple', 'well', 'write', 'feel', 'like', 'million', 'time', 'character', 'interest', 'lovable', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'forgot', 'say', 'movie', 'musical', 'work', 'girl', 'sing', 'feeling', 'simply', 'work', 'song', 'least', 'decent', 'perform', 'well', 'two', 'thing', 'like', 'comment', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'smooth', 'princess', 'pretty', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'two', 'handsome', 'feel', 'fake', 'would', 'benefit', 'movie', 'felt', 'real', 'yes', 'even', 'animate', 'movie', 'benefit', 'earth', 'ness', 'second', 'could', 'little', 'funnier', 'especially', 'opening', 'story', 'character', 'introduce', 'bit', 'boring', 'get', 'well', 'well', 'one', 'disney', 'movie', 'end', 'good', 'feel', 'completely', 'predictable', 'either']","[779, 263, 12, 59, 1056, 212, 570, 42, 15, 29, 10, 170, 24, 170, 24, 54, 247, 291, 128, 1360, 35, 12, 12, 516, 18, 165, 53, 9, 965, 20, 8, 122, 726, 21, 93, 173, 1557, 35, 1, 51, 107, 76, 63, 680, 341, 107, 11, 250, 546, 1332, 18, 42, 43, 9, 916, 1, 93, 21, 1878, 29, 136, 685, 6, 122, 42, 739, 53, 1537, 26, 1711, 1, 155, 195, 325, 28, 38, 1, 1711, 1776, 2782, 319, 54, 48, 1850, 121, 631, 12, 8, 736, 95, 370, 19, 18, 18, 10, 2, 1, 41, 17, 53, 291, 331, 353]"

249,-,"Frozen (2013) *** (out of 4) The latest Disney outing has a few flaws but there's still enough magic here to make it worth sitting through. Princess Anna goes searching for her sister, the Queen, who has special powers, which accidentally freeze their village. Anna hopes to bring her sister back home but there's a villain who has other ideas. FROZEN is such a visual beauty that one can really overlook the flaws and just sit back and enjoy the film. I'll start off with the flaws, which are the songs. It's not like we just get one, two or three songs but it really feels as if five-minutes doesn't go by before we get yet another. There are a couple stand out musical numbers but I just really felt that there were way too many and it ended up taking away from the story and the characters. Speaking of the characters, each of them were simply marvelous and they certainly helped draw you into the film and make you care about what's going on with them. The Anna character was one of the most charming in recent years. The sister, the hero and the snowman and reindeer were just flawless characters that added to the romance as well as the comedy. The constantly back and forth between the snowman and the reindeer was priceless and the two certainly could use their own movie. The one weak character turned out to be the villain who was someone we've just seen way too many times in these type of animation films. The visuals in the film were just amazing to see on a big screen and especially the beautiful snow-covered valley. I really thought the effects were wonderfully done and I especially liked a sequence early on where the Queen rushes across some water with the ice sparkling as she touches it. FROZEN isn't a complete masterpiece but it's another charming winner from the studio.","['frozen', 'late', 'disney', 'flaw', 'still', 'enough', 'magic', 'make', 'worth', 'sit', 'princess', 'anna', 'go', 'search', 'sister', 'queen', 'special', 'power', 'accidentally', 'freeze', 'village', 'anna', 'hope', 'bring', 'sister', 'back', 'home', 'villain', 'idea', 'frozen', 'visual', 'beauty', 'one', 'really', 'overlook', 'flaw', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'film', 'start', 'flaw', 'song', 'like', 'get', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'song', 'really', 'feel', 'five', 'minute', 'go', 'get', 'yet', 'another', 'couple', 'stand', 'musical', 'number', 'really', 'felt', 'way', 'many', 'end', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'character', 'speak', 'character', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'certainly', 'help', 'draw', 'film', 'make', 'care', 'go', 'anna', 'character', 'one', 'charm', 'recent', 'year', 'sister', 'hero', 'snowman', 'reindeer', 'flawless', 'character', 'add', 'romance', 'well', 'comedy', 'constantly', 'back', 'forth', 'snowman', 'reindeer', 'priceless', 'two', 'certainly', 'could', 'use', 'movie', 'one', 'weak', 'character', 'turn', 'villain', 'someone', 'see', 'way', 'many', 'time', 'type', 'animation', 'film', 'visuals', 'film', 'amaze', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'snow', 'cover', 'valley', 'really', 'thought', 'effect', 'wonderfully', 'especially', 'like', 'sequence', 'early', 'queen', 'rush', 'across', 'water', 'ice', 'sparkle', 'touch', 'frozen', 'complete', 'masterpiece', 'another', 'charm', 'winner', 'studio']","[5, 530, 2, 386, 68, 164, 150, 14, 254, 708, 29, 7, 13, 793, 15, 49, 316, 24, 300, 282, 2477, 7, 384, 221, 15, 74, 533, 104, 281, 5, 450, 149, 10, 22, 2247, 386, 708, 74, 91, 3, 120, 386, 11, 9, 19, 10, 42, 433, 11, 22, 53, 731, 211, 13, 19, 182, 102, 398, 361, 51, 184, 22, 155, 50, 61, 41, 55, 101, 12, 8, 641, 8, 341, 1957, 442, 135, 1128, 3, 14, 293, 13, 7, 8, 10, 235, 399, 47, 15, 544, 45, 151, 1132, 8, 269, 363, 18, 279, 1176, 74, 1761, 45, 151, 2783, 42, 442, 54, 158, 1, 10, 434, 8, 113, 104, 304, 16, 50, 61, 20, 524, 21, 3, 267, 3, 96, 16, 106, 369, 121, 93, 39, 712, 3562, 22, 92, 278, 1261, 121, 9, 502, 594, 49, 525, 1168, 1013, 33, 2226, 260, 5, 656, 461, 102, 235, 1419, 311]"

Much like Tangled, Disney managed to return to its old roots by recapturing the long lost Disney classic magic that enthralled the hearts of young and old.The story's main focus is on sisterhood love compared to romantic ones in the past. However, it does redefine the meaning of true love and and provides a clear moral message to the current younger generation: know the person you fall in love with, not just based on looks and appearances.The animation is top notch and stunning to watch. The soundtrack for the film is fantastic: the lovely songs ""Let It Go"", ""For the first time in forever"", ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"", ""Love is an Open Door""...are all good in its own right.Both princesses in the film are unique, independent, strong, brave young women which can serve good inspirations for many young girls out there. Young Elsa and Anna were so cute and adorable. Elsa is a very interesting character, it's quite rare for Disney to create a female character who is both complex and sympathetic at the same time. Sees herself as only a force of destruction, feeling that she doesn't belong in the Kingdom of Arendelle, it's actually quite heartbreaking to see Elsa forced to suppress her powers, withdraw all her emotions and tragically isolated from the outside world at a very young age just to protect her family and people.Come to think of it, it's actually quite a shame that she's not paired with a partner who truly love and understand her other than her sister (Although the current plot is not bad, it's just that it would be better if Elsa have a loving partner and her sister as well. She deserves it.).Overall, this film is definitely a worthy entry to the long line of Disney's greatest animated musical classics for the years to come. Finally, Disney returned to its former glory. Highly recommended to any family or Disney fans who loved the classics.Animated short film - ""Get a horse"": Although it blends in the classic black and white look and modern 3D animation of Mickey, Minnie, and Pete, but nothing spectacular or worth mentioning here compared to Pixar's thoughtful animated shorts.Rating: 8.5/10","['frozen', 'late', 'successful', 'animate', 'musical', 'entry', 'disney', 'tangle', 'story', 'heartwarming', 'emotionally', 'engage', 'unpretentious', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'time', 'also', 'provide', 'good', 'plot', 'twist', 'climax', 'much', 'like', 'tangle', 'disney', 'manage', 'return', 'old', 'root', 'recapture', 'long', 'lose', 'disney', 'classic', 'magic', 'enthral', 'heart', 'young', 'old', 'story', 'main', 'focus', 'sisterhood', 'love', 'compare', 'romantic', 'one', 'past', 'however', 'redefine', 'meaning', 'true', 'love', 'provide', 'clear', 'moral', 'message', 'current', 'young', 'generation', 'know', 'person', 'fall', 'love', 'base', 'look', 'appearance', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'stun', 'watch', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'fantastic', 'lovely', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'good', 'right', 'princess', 'film', 'unique', 'independent', 'strong', 'brave', 'young', 'woman', 'serve', 'good', 'inspiration', 'many', 'young', 'girl', 'young', 'elsa', 'anna', 'cute', 'adorable', 'elsa', 'interest', 'character', 'quite', 'rare', 'disney', 'create', 'female', 'character', 'complex', 'sympathetic', 'time', 'see', 'force', 'destruction', 'feel', 'belong', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'actually', 'quite', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'elsa', 'force', 'suppress', 'power', 'withdraw', 'emotion', 'tragically', 'isolated', 'outside', 'world', 'young', 'age', 'protect', 'family', 'people', 'come', 'think', 'actually', 'quite', 'shame', 'pair', 'partner', 'truly', 'love', 'understand', 'sister', 'although', 'current', 'plot', 'bad', 'would', 'well', 'elsa', 'love', 'partner', 'sister', 'well', 'deserves', 'overall', 'film', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'entry', 'long', 'line', 'disney', 'great', 'animate', 'musical', 'classic', 'year', 'come', 'finally', 'disney', 'return', 'former', 'glory', 'highly', 'recommend', 'family', 'disney', 'fan', 'love', 'classic', 'animate', 'short', 'film', 'get', 'horse', 'although', 'blend', 'classic', 'black', 'white', 'look', 'modern', 'animation', 'mickey', 'minnie', 'pete', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'worth', 'mention', 'compare', 'pixar', 'thoughtful', 'animate', 'short', 'rating']","[5, 530, 814, 38, 51, 1889, 2, 83, 12, 803, 910, 619, 2298, 306, 23, 20, 27, 458, 17, 52, 129, 792, 31, 9, 83, 2, 857, 385, 64, 885, 2919, 169, 489, 2, 69, 150, 2189, 80, 73, 64, 12, 119, 261, 861, 6, 350, 393, 10, 276, 110, 4424, 672, 62, 6, 458, 871, 551, 185, 1481, 73, 616, 56, 441, 186, 6, 256, 66, 1225, 21, 239, 1129, 315, 23, 225, 3, 253, 765, 11, 30, 13, 36, 20, 287, 59, 202, 45, 6, 318, 478, 17, 130, 29, 3, 414, 1058, 167, 335, 73, 251, 1173, 17, 1788, 61, 73, 76, 73, 4, 7, 265, 687, 4, 122, 8, 124, 1308, 2, 134, 237, 8, 771, 1616, 20, 16, 272, 3156, 53, 2784, 77, 199, 103, 124, 2171, 16, 4, 272, 1885, 24, 240, 3157, 782, 769, 126, 73, 139, 513, 72, 46, 40, 37, 103, 124, 1403, 1441, 2446, 329, 6, 216, 15, 255, 1481, 52, 65, 26, 18, 4, 6, 2446, 15, 18, 592, 166, 3, 174, 790, 1889, 169, 213, 2, 25, 38, 51, 69, 47, 40, 241, 2, 385, 1662, 1619, 472, 262, 72, 2, 176, 6, 69, 38, 263, 3, 19, 1015, 255, 1551, 69, 1172, 365, 66, 324, 21, 850, 3158, 3155, 156, 671, 254, 348, 350, 194, 3644, 38, 263, 437]"

Some very realistic and beautiful images of outdoor scenery. Some fantastical designs. (I did not see the 3-D version)Secondly, the voicings of the characters were excellent. I was already a fan of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff and Alan Tudyk. But I did not realize that Kristen Bell has such a beautiful singing voice. The story is a drama that centers around two sisters, one of whom has a trait that might be considered a curse. As in all Disney films, there is plenty of humor to offset the drama.

253,8,"Frozen is yet another Disney animated movie, but unlike many in the past few years, this one really works! To start off, it's a strong story, one that is based on the fairy tale ""The Snow Queen,"" by Hans Christian Andersen. It tells the tale of two sisters of royalty in what is a kingdom of a fantasy world, but very much feels like Scandinavia. The older sister, Elsa has a magic power that everything she touches turns to ice. This is both a power and a curse as she finds out with her family. Her younger sister, Anna does not know about this power of her sister's but eventually comes to learn about it. From there, the story takes us on an adventure of Anna looking to find Elsa who leaves the kingdom unexpectedly.It is an exciting story and is filled with other tremendous characters that add great life to the film including Kristoff, who is a Viking-type that loves the cold and has a reindeer named Sven. There is also a snowman named Olaf who wants nothing other than to know what the summer is like. Their personalities not only add much humor, but also a lot of heart to the plot.Another great quality of the film is the animation. And I will say it is great! It may be some of the best I have ever seen, beautifully showing the winter and the settings around the kingdom. It was a joy just watching the landscape shots unfold here.The other surprising aspect to it was the songs. Yes, it's a musical, so anyone who doesn't like them, it may not be their cup of tea. The songs though are very strong, giving not only some great messages in them, but also some beats that will keep sticking in your head after it's over.With all these aspects, the film pans out to a fun, adventurous and sweet tale that people of all ages will love. It's one of the best Disney films that I can remember in quite some time!

259,7,"Strangely, of the two theatrical Frozen films, I'm more familiar with the sequel than this one. That said, Frozen will probably be - for the foreseeable future - THE film that I think of when I think of Disney.This may be an unpopular opinion, but this film stands head and shoulders above the films (that I've seen) which are referred to as ""Disney Classics."" I understand that some of the misdirection of certain character tropes is a bit on-the-nose most of the time, and the story maybe isn't the most airtight ever imagined, but what this film lacks in certain areas of writing, it makes up for in the characters and the soundtrack.The characters are extremely likable in their own way. I remember many reviews of this film when this was new saying that Olaf either had the potential to be annoying or was annoying, but I found him to be fine. His voice acting makes him to be a more unique character as far as side characters in these types of films go and I think it was well executed.The humor in this film is quite good. I didn't laugh at all of the jokes but the ones I did I thought were genuinely funny. The strongest joke in this film, for me, (not to give away any spoilers) has to do with a sled.The soundtrack for Frozen is superb. A lot of the same motifs are brought back again, and again, but every time that happens, it's recontextualized by the imagery in the film and does not feel repetitive as a result. The songs are like listening to an album where every song is Top 10 material while also being substantial in their own individual ways. The first 35 minutes or so of this film are hit after hit and it just keeps going. I cannot compliment the quality of this film's soundtrack enough, and this aspect alone is what sets in apart as superior to the vast majority of the classic Disney films.As someone virtually untouched by the insane popularity Frozen received in the year after its release, I'm able to experience this film from a fairly neutral perspective and as a result, I can say that this film raises the bar for what makes a modern Disney classic. I think this will stand the test of time and I reckon those who experienced this film as children will probably have the same attachment to Frozen as older generations did with films like Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast.I can't recommend it enough.","['strangely', 'two', 'theatrical', 'frozen', 'film', 'familiar', 'sequel', 'one', 'say', 'frozen', 'probably', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'film', 'think', 'think', 'disney', 'may', 'unpopular', 'opinion', 'film', 'stand', 'head', 'shoulder', 'film', 'see', 'refer', 'disney', 'classic', 'understand', 'misdirection', 'certain', 'character', 'trope', 'bit', 'nose', 'time', 'story', 'maybe', 'airtight', 'ever', 'imagine', 'film', 'lack', 'certain', 'area', 'write', 'make', 'character', 'soundtrack', 'character', 'extremely', 'likable', 'way', 'remember', 'many', 'review', 'film', 'new', 'say', 'olaf', 'either', 'potential', 'annoy', 'annoy', 'found', 'fine', 'voice', 'act', 'make', 'unique', 'character', 'far', 'side', 'character', 'type', 'film', 'go', 'think', 'well', 'execute', 'humor', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'laugh', 'joke', 'one', 'thought', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'strong', 'joke', 'film', 'give', 'away', 'spoiler', 'sled', 'soundtrack', 'frozen', 'superb', 'lot', 'motif', 'brought', 'back', 'every', 'time', 'happens', 'recontextualized', 'imagery', 'film', 'feel', 'repetitive', 'result', 'song', 'like', 'listen', 'album', 'every', 'song', 'top', 'material', 'also', 'substantial', 'individual', 'way', 'first', 'minute', 'film', 'hit', 'hit', 'keep', 'go', 'compliment', 'quality', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'enough', 'aspect', 'alone', 'set', 'apart', 'superior', 'vast', 'majority', 'classic', 'disney', 'film', 'someone', 'virtually', 'untouched', 'insane', 'popularity', 'frozen', 'receive', 'year', 'release', 'able', 'experience', 'film', 'fairly', 'neutral', 'perspective', 'result', 'say', 'film', 'raise', 'bar', 'make', 'modern', 'disney', 'classic', 'think', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'reckon', 'experienced', 'film', 'child', 'probably', 'attachment', 'frozen', 'old', 'generation', 'film', 'like', 'cinderella', 'beauty', 'beast', 'recommend', 'enough']","[3066, 42, 2389, 5, 3, 1077, 561, 10, 35, 5, 210, 607, 3, 37, 37, 2, 171, 2597, 258, 3, 361, 317, 3649, 3, 16, 2064, 2, 69, 216, 4431, 563, 8, 1032, 95, 971, 20, 12, 232, 81, 1137, 3, 273, 563, 1266, 165, 14, 8, 225, 8, 423, 402, 50, 391, 61, 161, 3, 108, 35, 32, 353, 685, 238, 238, 231, 470, 86, 112, 14, 414, 8, 142, 387, 8, 524, 3, 13, 37, 18, 1450, 222, 3, 124, 17, 190, 451, 10, 92, 1882, 85, 167, 451, 3, 57, 101, 419, 2398, 225, 5, 904, 84, 1896, 599, 74, 115, 20, 591, 2253, 3, 53, 1982, 648, 11, 9, 531, 2254, 115, 11, 239, 1080, 27, 2574, 1921, 50, 36, 211, 3, 234, 234, 154, 13, 2044, 283, 3, 225, 164, 443, 344, 144, 512, 1185, 2726, 1163, 69, 2, 3, 304, 2607, 3622, 2316, 1872, 5, 852, 47, 288, 294, 334, 3, 890, 4432, 1141, 648, 35, 3, 760, 1477, 14, 324, 2, 69, 37, 361, 1279, 20, 1451, 3, 70, 210, 5, 64, 616, 3, 9, 854, 149, 203, 262, 164]"

272,10,"What I Loved Best The story-line The Characters The Music Some Things That I Wish To Change I would like to see more of Elsa in the movieFrozen is a movie made by Disney. I think it is the best movie ever. It is about two sister living in a castle. When one sister was young she had magical powers and hurt her sister by accident. Her parents took her to she trolls that can help her sister recover. her parents kept her away from everyone and locked up the castle so she can keep her powers safe but when she has to become queen she runs away and turns the village in a ever lasting snow storm. Her sister has to stop her and stop the everlasting snow storm.Frozen is a amazing movie. When a girl accidentally starts an everlasting snowstorm her sister has to try and stop it. There are lots of characters in the movie. Elsa the girl with ice powers, Anna the sister of Elsa a fun loving girl who is looking for a friend, Christoph a man raised by trolls, Spen a reindeer that's friends with Christoph and Olaf a snowman that came alive by Elsa and love the idea of summer.Some of the best parts of the movie is when Elsa runs away and sings my favorite song of the movie let it go. Another fun part in this movie is when Anna and Christoph meets Olaf. This movie is fun and amazing. The play list for all the songs in the movies has been one of the top play list when it came out. I think this is a amazing movie and is fun to watch. There are hidden fun thing in this film you would have never have seen if you didn't have known.Frozen is one of my favorite movies. I think Frozen has cool songs and I never get tired of watching it.

Likewise the characters. There were some funny moments but no laugh out loud moments like Disney movies often deliver. The token comic character (the snowman) was terribly cliché. A lot of fuss was made over the movie portraying a strong female character. To be honest I think Brave did a far better job of that. Rather than the giggling girl gushing over a handsome prince we got in Frozen, Brave gave us a strong young women who was completely capable and independent. Brave also didn't have female leads who looked like Bratz dolls. A lot of fuss was also made about the Let It Go song. Again I thought it was a decent song but nothing terribly catchy or memorable. Certainly not up to the standard of songs from The Lion King or The Little Mermaid. Overall I found this movie to be pretty mediocre. Fun viewing but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.

It features a pair of princesses from the fictional country of Arrendale who are, rather expectedly, as different as night and day: Coolly reserved and classically beautiful, Elsa (Idina Menzel, Broadway stalwart and occasional ""Glee"" guest star) is born with the seemingly limitless gift of being able to manipulate ice and snow, able to produce it with a wave of her hand, while her little sister Anna (Kristen Bell) is ordinary but naturally vivacious and plucky.A childhood accident that leaves Anna aesthetically scarred with a lock of blond hair in her auburn locks convinces Elsa that her powers must be hidden in order to prevent further harm. Yet the more the truth is concealed, the less control she has. Elsa withdraws both emotionally and physically, alienating Anna and creating in her both a strong independence and a yearning for love and attention. Things take a turn for the worse with their parents' passing. On the day of Elsa's coronation, an argument with Anna – who is insistent on marrying Hans (Santino Fontana), a prince she met merely moments ago – agitates her to the point where she reveals her long-concealed powers to the entire city and visitors. Terrified, Elsa flees into a distant mountain, letting loose the full extent of her talent in the construction of a new ice palace to retreat into. Meanwhile, guilt-ridden and left with a country languishing in eternal winter, Anna travels into the cold to make peace with her sister, enlisting the help of a woodsman in the unfortunate business of selling snow, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), together with his highly intuitive but non-speaking reindeer Sven and the adorable snowman Olaf (Josh Gad). In the middle of it, Anna gets iced in the heart, a fatal injury that can only be resolved by (what else?) an act of true love but what does that look like, and is it what everyone imagines it to be?The digital effects are top-notch, and this isn't just in reference to the characters' hair. Donning the 3D glasses in a typical cinema (that is, non-IMAX) gives an experience that is nearly IMAX quality. Snowflakes almost seem to fall out of the screen; the wintry landscapes seem to reduce the temperatures palpably by a few degrees Celsius. It's a highly immersive experience, but what could pull you back during the show is when the characters breaks into song. When done well, it's seamless; otherwise, you feel almost immediately removed. There aren't showstopping numbers that could even think of standing alongside classics like Aladdin's ""A Whole New World""; the songs are mostly enjoyable, almost Broadway-friendly, such as the duet between the sisters entitled ""The First Time in Forever"" and Olaf's entertaining but bittersweet ""In Summer"". But disappointingly, the love song ""Love is an Open Door"" is highly mediocre.With the exception of ""Mulan"" and arguably ""Brave"", this animation features the most powerful and independent lead female characters from Disney in recent times. It's a refreshing change from past fare, with the studio recognising that making a kiss from a prince a do-or-die thing could use some updating and inspiration from other young adult role models, like Katniss from ""The Hunger Games"". Elsa, in particular, is admirably talented and perhaps overly powerful, hindered only by a lack of confidence and overwhelming fear of rejection. One can feel her self-actualisation unfolding when Menzel belts out the moving epic solo ""Let It Go"". Anna's determination shines through despite her neediness and immaturity. There is some element of dependence on the men in the film – Kristoff was essential out in the wilds – but when it comes down to it, both sisters relied on their own courage and wit to overcome the odds.Bell leverages on her sprightly voice as Anna, who never lets the energy or pace flag and Groff is an impressive singer, but both are clearly outclassed by the solid prowess of Menzel, who is by far the best of the lot and ups the musical ante.While not especially funny or romantic, the clever plot turns and the eventual twist at the end rounds up this wintry tale with a polished finish.","['walt', 'disney', 'picture', 'celebrate', 'reputation', 'often', 'entwine', 'impressive', 'history', 'animate', 'musical', 'mention', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king',

The problems are that instead of focusing more on Elsa using her cool powers, they make her 'misunderstood' and focus on utter randomness with comedy and messages that men are either gross or evil. The characters are dull. Hans looks like he was ripped straight from one of those ""Barbie: The Royal Queen!"" direct to DVD films! EXTREMELY overrated. If it wasn't a musical with it's 'amazing songs', it would have been nowhere as successful. The songs are boring and annoying. Important plot detail? Sure, just after this song! I could make an album of better songs using dust, a block of wood and rotton toe nails. A child would have a better time watching Evil Dead, for goodness sakes! PASS THIS MOVIE!

283,9,"Disney's 50th classic, Tangled (2010), marked the beginning where 3D Disney animated features aimed for the warmth and feel of Disney's first renaissance (The Little Mermaid (1989) up to Tarzan (1999)). The decade following this renaissance would become a watershed period (2000-8) of poorly received films, and suffering losses at the box office. Pixar would essentially be the dominating force in a new 3D world, and Disney's attempt with Chicken Little (2005) (poorly received, but OK at the box office) and Meet the Robinsons (2007) could not live up to the beasts produced at Pixar. The year 2009 with the return of the star director of John Musker and John Clements of the first renaissance era, critics have coined that Disney might be in a second renaissance. The idea was that they would return to traditional hand drawn 2D animation to recapture the feel and warmth which the first renaissance Disney films were associated with. Musker/Clements' The Princess and the Frog (2009) was essentially a welcoming sight for many fans, however, it still just performed a quarter of what The Lion King (1994) grossed with around roughly 250$ USD. Then Oscar winning animated short Paperman (2012) happened which was a beautiful mixture of 2D style in a 3D environment, and during the production of Tangled (2010), the aim was exactly this: a 3D animated feature with the same warmth and feel as the 2D. It generated nearly 600 million USD in profit, and the following Frozen (2014) generated over 1,1 billion USD on a budget of 150 million. Frozen (2014) is the first film in 20 years to gross more than Lion King (1994) which was up to 2010 the animated feature king at the box office when Pixar's Toy Story 3 (2010) was the new crown at the box office. From a financial stand-point, box office performance is what ""decides what is a good movie"" which is a sad thing to say, but that's the reality of the industry, but Frozen's success is not purely rooted in a money making formula.It is the return of the renaissance Disney with modern themes and less bound to conventions found in the older Disney classics. It is loosely based on the Danish fairytale author H. C. Andersen's The Snow Queen, where the title character has bee changed into a deuteragonist (second most important character which can be both with or against the protagonist, in this case both). Elsa, our Snow Queen, is a one of the most relatable character created by Disney which deals with the strife of family, and the conflict of holding back yourself from hurting your beloved ones. The second most notable change is the relationships between boys and girls, Frozen is not necessarily a feminist film, but it is certainly proto-feminist. Elsa and Anna are the driving force of the film, and without spoiling anything, are also the ones who resolve the conflict.Women have for a long history in film been secondary to male plot-driven characters. Women were something to look at, and rarely contribute to the plot. If the Hunger Games (2011) marked the beginning of box office giants with leading female roles, Disney's Frozen marks the beginning where driving forces of female characters can generate animated films of 1 billion USD, and possibly a second renaissance.","['disney', 'th', 'classic', 'tangle', 'marked', 'begin', 'disney', 'animate', 'feature', 'aim', 'warmth', 'feel', 'disney', 'first', 'renaissance', 'little', 'mermaid', 'tarzan', 'decade', 'follow', 'renaissance', 'would', 'become', 'watershed', 'period', 'poorly', 'receive', 'film', 'suffer', 'loss', 'box', 'office', 'pixar', 'would', 'essentially', 'dominate', 'force', 'new', 'world', 'disney', 'attempt', 'chicken', 'little', 'poorly', 'receive', 'ok', 'box', 'office', 'meet', 'robinson', 'could', 'live', 'beast', 'produce', 'pixar', 'year', 'return', 'star', 'director', 'john', 'musker', 'john', 'clements', 'first', 'renaissance', 'era', 'critic', 'coin', 'disney', 'might', 'second', 'renaissance', 'idea', 'would', 'return', 'traditional', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'recapture', 'feel', 'warmth', 'first', 'renaissance', 'disney', 'film', 'associate', 'musker', 'clements', 'princess', 'frog', 'essentially', 'welcome', 'sight', 'many', 'fan', 'however', 'still', 'perform', 'quarter', 'lion', 'king', 'gross', 'around', 'roughly', 'usd', 'oscar', 'win', 'animate', 'short', 'paperman', 'happen', 'beautiful', 'mixture', 'style', 'environment', 'production', 'tangle', 'aim', 'exactly', 'animate', 'feature', 'warmth', 'feel', 'generate', 'nearly', 'million', 'usd', 'profit', 'follow', 'frozen', 'generate', 'billion', 'usd', 'budget', 'million', 'frozen', 'first', 'film', 'year', 'gross', 'lion', 'king', 'animate', 'feature', 'king', 'box', 'office', 'pixar', 'toy', 'story', 'new', 'crown', 'box', 'office', 'financial', 'stand', 'point', 'box', 'office', 'performance', 'decides', 'good', 'movie', 'sad', 'thing', 'say', 'reality', 'industry', 'frozen', 'success', 'purely', 'root', 'money', 'make', 'formula', 'return', 'renaissance', 'disney', 'modern', 'theme', 'less', 'bound', 'convention', 'found', 'old', 'disney', 'classic', 'loosely', 'base', 'danish', 'fairytale', 'author', 'h', 'c', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'title', 'character', 'bee', 'change', 'deuteragonist', 'second', 'important', 'character', 'protagonist', 'case', 'elsa', 'snow', 'queen', 'one', 'relatable', 'character', 'create', 'disney', 'deal', 'strife', 'family', 'conflict', 'hold', 'back', 'hurt', 'beloved', 'one', 'second', 'notable', 'change', 'relationship', 'boy', 'girl', 'frozen', 'necessarily', 'feminist', 'film', 'certainly', 'proto', 'feminist', 'elsa', 'anna', 'drive', 'force', 'film', 'without', 'spoil', 'anything', 'also', 'one', 'resolve', 'conflict', 'woman', 'long', 'history', 'film', 'secondary', 'male', 'plot', 'driven', 'character', 'woman', 'something', 'look', 'rarely', 'contribute', 'plot', 'hunger', 'game', 'marked', 'begin', 'box', 'office', 'giant', 'lead', 'female', 'role', 'disney', 'frozen', 'mark', 'begin', 'drive', 'force', 'female', 'character', 'generate', 'animate', 'film', 'billion', 'usd', 'possibly', 'second', 'renaissance']","[2, 1210, 69, 83, 3456, 160, 2, 38, 229, 859, 1324, 53, 2, 36, 465, 48, 422, 975, 492, 378, 465, 26, 179, 1295, 1125, 852, 3, 888, 1927, 598, 717, 194, 26, 1668, 2731, 272, 108, 126, 2, 448, 2405, 48, 1125, 852, 477, 598, 717, 244, 2301, 54, 224, 203, 587, 194, 47, 385, 249, 770, 1205, 4458, 1205, 4459, 36, 465, 942, 730, 2, 252, 319, 465, 281, 26, 385, 462, 323, 747, 21, 2919, 53, 1324, 36, 465, 2, 3, 2793, 4458, 4459, 29, 659, 1668, 1108, 675, 61, 176, 110, 68, 1332, 3663, 152, 97, 783, 200, 3036, 2485, 302, 374, 38, 263, 3664, 290, 93, 1804, 355, 1147, 700, 83, 859, 522, 38, 229, 1324, 53, 1286, 501, 965, 2485, 2486, 378, 5, 1286, 1159, 2485, 1351, 965, 5, 36, 3, 47, 783, 152, 97, 38, 229, 97, 598, 717, 194, 463, 12, 108, 722, 598, 717, 361, 117, 598, 717, 493, 996, 17, 1, 579, 43, 35, 940, 2959, 5, 577, 2115, 885, 661, 14, 534, 385, 465, 2, 324, 226, 321, 2050, 2259, 231, 64, 2, 69, 696, 256, 2487, 756, 2322, 2051, 1781, 339, 39, 49, 590, 8, 4460, 209, 3166, 319, 289, 8, 354, 514, 4, 39, 49, 10, 884, 8, 134, 2, 701, 72, 552, 655, 74, 305, 1280, 10, 319, 1805, 209, 153, 408, 76, 5, 1284, 720, 3, 442, 720, 4, 7, 1192, 272, 3, 137, 1056, 212, 27, 10, 1298, 552, 251, 169, 636, 3, 1665, 431, 52, 3126, 8, 251, 89, 66, 1691, 3416, 52, 3165, 925, 3456, 160, 598, 717, 1171, 248, 237, 371, 2, 5, 820, 160, 1192, 272, 237, 8, 1286, 38, 3, 1159, 2485, 842, 319, 465]"

285,7,"Seeing this near opening day, I had no idea Frozen would explode to be the #1 highest grossing animated film of all time. Like others, I was left disappointed by the trailers, and had ""cold"" expectations.Turns out, it was a pretty good movie. Not the best animated film of all time, but I have no issue with its popularity.In a sense, it is yet another deconstruction of the ""princess"" movie, like ""The Princess and the Frog"", ""Tangled"" and ""Brave"" before it. I'd complain, but the princess Disney films were always the worst ones. More importantly, the film also focuses on sibling relationships, Elsa's powers symbolic for severe introversion. The characters are cute, likable, and more complex than the typical 3D fare. The animation was among the best of 2013, especially for me, who finds something romantic about nighttime snowscapes.There are problems, but most of it can be chalked up to the fact it is a family film. The characters could have been deeper and the musical numbers better, but they're not meant for an adult audience. Even the snowman, while unnecessary, was tolerable, and made my theater explode in giggles. And who am I to argue against the laughter of children? :PDisney had a weak decade in the 00s, with giant bombs that sealed western traditional animation's fate and forgettable 3D titles. If it weren't for Pixar, they'd be worse than Dreamworks. But their latest works have been steps in the right direction. Frozen will likely go down as much of an animated classic as The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. But whenever or not we entered the next Disney Renaissance remains to be seen.P.S. - ""Let it Go"" and the scene that accompanies it are amazing~","['see', 'near', 'opening', 'day', 'idea', 'frozen', 'would', 'explode', 'high', 'gross', 'animate', 'film', 'time', 'like', 'others', 'left', 'disappointed', 'trailer', 'cold', 'expectation', 'turn', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'time', 'issue', 'popularity', 'sense', 'yet', 'another', 'deconstruction', 'princess', 'movie', 'like', 'princess', 'frog', 'tangle', 'brave', 'complain', 'princess', 'disney', 'film', 'always', 'bad', 'one', 'importantly', 'film', 'also', 'focus', 'sibling', 'relationship', 'elsa', 'power', 'symbolic', 'severe', 'introversion', 'character', 'cute', 'likable', 'complex', 'typical', 'fare', 'animation', 'among', 'best', 'especially', 'find', 'something', 'romantic', 'nighttime', 'snowscapes', 'problem', 'chalked', 'fact', 'family', 'film', 'character', 'could', 'deeper', 'musical', 'number', 'well', 'meant', 'adult', 'audience', 'even', 'snowman', 'unnecessary', 'tolerable', 'make', 'theater', 'explode', 'giggle', 'argue', 'laughter', 'child', 'pdisney', 'weak', 'decade', 'giant', 'bomb', 'seal', 'western', 'traditional', 'animation', 'fate', 'forgettable', 'title', 'pixar', 'bad', 'dreamworks', 'late', 'work', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'frozen', 'likely', 'go', 'much', 'animate', 'classic', 'lion', 'king', 'beauty', 'beast', 'whenever', 'enter', 'next', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'remains', 'see', 'p', 'let', 'go', 'scene', 'accompanies', 'amaze']","[16, 449, 631, 138, 281, 5, 26, 2794, 206, 783, 38, 3, 20, 9, 247, 330, 476, 394, 366, 452, 113, 136, 17, 1, 34, 38, 3, 20, 519, 1872, 217, 182, 102, 4461, 29, 1, 9, 29, 659, 83, 335, 1460, 29, 2, 3, 163, 65, 10, 1398, 3, 27, 261, 409, 153, 4, 24, 3574, 3665, 4462, 8, 265, 402, 771, 376, 1591, 21, 471, 34, 121, 71, 89, 393, 198, 201, 72, 3, 8, 54, 1354, 51, 184, 18, 868, 147, 159, 28, 45, 845, 1914, 14, 312, 2794, 1388, 1247, 1679, 70, 434, 492, 1171, 2710, 2768, 3666, 462, 21, 1648, 660, 590, 194, 65, 1035, 530, 107, 668, 130, 754, 5, 1016, 13, 31, 38, 69, 152, 97, 149, 203, 1267, 1683, 418, 2, 465, 1550, 16, 1500, 30, 13, 90, 3667, 96]"

287,5,"Review: This animation spectacular is made extremely well and the various characters were a great choice by the directors, but it's more for the kiddies than the adults. It's corny songs and the Cinderella type storyline is typical from Disney, but you do end up getting caught up in the magical world. The little snow man with the carrot nose, made me laugh, but personally, I was expecting more from this Billion dollar movie. This is what always happens when you hear so much hype about a movie before you watch it. Anyway, the kids will be singing along and enjoying the amazing colours, but for an adult, it's not as good as Despicable Me or The Croods. Enjoyable!Round-Up: It's weird how the movies which you expect to be major blockbusters, it about break even and that classic movies that are made for the whole family always smash the box office. No matter what anyone says, Disney have got the magical touch when it comes to entertaining the little ones, and now that they have Pixar in the camp, they are untouchable. I'm not too sure if they are the best people to have bought Marvel, but we are yet to see the outcome. Anyway, none of the voices in this movie are recognisable, which keeps the characters fresh and original. The bonus cartoon on the DVD was fun, which has some of the old Disney favourites, so it's definitely worth a purchase.Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $1.1billion (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there Disney, Cinderella type movies which brings you into a magical world with love and deceit. 5/10","['review', 'animation', 'spectacular', 'make', 'extremely', 'well', 'various', 'character', 'great', 'choice', 'director', 'kiddy', 'adult', 'corny', 'song', 'cinderella', 'type', 'storyline', 'typical', 'disney', 'end', 'get', 'caught', 'magical', 'world', 'little', 'snow', 'man', 'carrot', 'nose', 'make', 'laugh', 'personally', 'expect', 'billion', 'dollar', 'movie', 'always', 'happens', 'hear', 'much', 'hype', 'movie', 'watch', 'anyway', 'kid', 'sing', 'along', 'enjoy', 'amaze', 'colour', 'adult', 'good', 'despicable', 'croods', 'enjoyable', 'round', 'weird', 'movie', 'expect', 'major', 'blockbuster', 'break', 'even', 'classic', 'movie', 'make', 'whole', 'family', 'always', 'smash', 'box', 'office', 'matter', 'anyone', 'say', 'disney', 'get', 'magical', 'touch', 'come', 'entertain', 'little', 'one', 'pixar', 'camp', 'untouchable', 'sure', 'best', 'people', 'bought', 'marvel', 'yet', 'see', 'outcome', 'anyway', 'none', 'voice', 'movie', 'recognisable', 'keep', 'character', 'fresh', 'original', 'bonus', 'cartoon', 'dvd', 'fun', 'old', 'disney', 'favourite', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchase', 'budget', 'million', 'worldwide', 'gross', 'billion', 'wow', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'disney', 'cinderella', 'type', 'movie', 'brings', 'magical', 'world', 'love', 'deceit']","[161, 21, 671, 14, 423, 18, 1131, 8, 25, 862, 770, 4263, 147, 1737, 11, 854, 524, 295, 376, 2, 41, 19, 1707, 170, 126, 48, 39, 145, 1146, 971, 14, 190, 520, 131, 1159, 1446, 1, 163, 591, 568, 31, 406, 1, 23, 497, 60, 63, 172, 91, 96, 1452, 147, 17, 1158, 1625, 306, 911, 1063, 1, 131, 823, 1875, 340, 28, 69, 1, 14, 127, 72, 163, 2160, 598, 717, 375, 299, 35, 2, 19, 170, 260, 40, 243, 48, 10, 194, 3600, 207, 34, 46, 1863, 1448, 182, 16, 1682, 497, 679, 86, 1, 154, 8, 819, 230, 2055, 314, 540, 125, 64, 2, 622, 174, 254, 1973, 1351, 965, 1953, 783, 1159, 926, 262, 1, 46, 2, 854, 524, 1, 509, 170, 126, 6]"
288,9,"Walt Disney Animation made some of the best movies of all time during the 1990's (Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast). During the previous decade, they tried to change their movies, tried to remove the musical aspect they were well known for in order to make them seemingly fit the changing tastes of the crowd of the new century. The movies they produced (Chicken Little, Meet the Robinson's, etc.) were good at best, but none of them became all-time classics in a manner similar to their aptly named Big Four. This movie, this brilliant, evocative masterpiece is a welcome return to their previously lost glory.Despite their return to tradition, Frozen is not your everyday fairytale love story. A bond between sisters isn't usually the stuff of fairytale legend. However, the folks of Disney have worked their magic and woven a plot which showcases the power and purity of the same bond in a beautiful manner. While its true that the story was inspired from The Snow Queen by Hans Christian Anderson, the movie is still pure Disney magic. Part of this magic is represented by the musical score of the movie. Movies such as Aladdin and The Lion King gave us some of the most memorable songs of our childhood (speaking to 1990-borns like me of course). It would not be a stretch to say that this movie's soundtrack equals in quality, if not surpasses, compared to those of the previously mentioned movies. The song Let It Go was a particularly enchanting track, and watching Queen Elsa perform it during the movie never fails to make me smile. The plot and soundtrack have been supplemented by some amazing animation. This is showcased in the portrayal of emotions of the two sisters, Elsa and Anna. Despite looking so similar (hair not- withstanding), they portray the same emotions differently based on their character differences. This presents great strides in the animation quality of Disney movies. Of course, as you can see by my 9/10 star rating, the movie does have its faults. I felt that some of the characters did not make much of an effect on the movie, such as the snowman Olaf. Elsa and Hans should also have been given more screen time, particularly Elsa who's story required some more closure. Also, the twist at the end regarding the villain was rather melodramatic and clichéd.These faults however, pale in comparison to the pros and all in all, Frozen is one of the best musical animated masterpieces made and will be remembered as a Disney classic.

289,9,"THE GOOD. After seeing this movie a second time, I like it even more. It's just a glorious masterpiece of animation! But lets go into the details: the main characters, Anna and Elsa are very well written and well developed characters, especially compared to previous Disney princesses (who they take a jab at occasionally). Anna is an incredibly fun princess and Elsa is quite tragic but still very relatable. The other characters are great, even Olaf the snowman, the character that everyone thought they would hate turned out to be very funny! The story is very well thought out and nothing is said or done that isn't revisited. There is two twists at the end that are very unexpected and fit the story perfectly, nothing like the story I thought I'd see. A big staple of Disney has always been the music, and Frozen's soundtrack, orchestral and songs, surpass the standard. ""Let it Go"", ""First Time in Forever"", ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman"", all the songs are fantastic and memorable. The songs here give Beauty and the Beast a run for its money! And as usual from Disney, the animation is beautiful. The environments seem very Skyrim-esque, the graphics of the ice is flawless.THE BAD. I don't have much to complain about but there are a couple of things that distract me. Even though the animation is amazing some of the textures they use for characters and various things seem a little low- res. ""Fixer-Upper"" is quite a pointless song, as fun as it is. And the film seems to take quite a few queues from the X-Men films, from the basic setup to some of the shots the film uses.THE BOTTOM LINE People say this is up there with Beauty and The Beast and The Little Mermaid, and well... they're right. It's gorgeously animated, fantastic music, memorable characters and great story. Frozen will surely stand the test of time as one of Disney's greatest.","['good', 'see', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'like', 'even', 'glorious', 'masterpiece', 'animation', 'let', 'go', 'detail', 'main', 'character', 'anna', 'elsa', 'well', 'write', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'especially', 'compare', 'previous', 'disney', 'princess', 'take', 'jab', 'occasionally', 'anna', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'princess', 'elsa', 'quite', 'tragic', 'still', 'relatable', 'character', 'great', 'even', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'character', 'everyone', 'thought', 'would', 'hate', 'turn', 'funny', 'story', 'well', 'thought', 'nothing', 'say', 'revisit', 'two', 'twist', 'end', 'unexpected', 'fit', 'story', 'perfectly', 'nothing', 'like', 'story', 'thought', 'see', 'big', 'staple', 'disney', 'always', 'music', 'frozen', 'soundtrack', 'orchestral', 'song', 'surpass', 'standard', 'let', 'go', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'wan', 'build', 'snowman', 'song', 'fantastic', 'memorable', 'song', 'give', 'beauty', 'beast', 'run', 'money', 'usual', 'disney', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'environment', 'seem', 'skyrim', 'esque', 'graphic', 'ice', 'flawless', 'bad', 'much', 'complain', 'couple', 'thing', 'distract', 'even', 'though', 'animation', 'amaze', 'texture', 'use', 'character', 'various', 'thing', 'seem', 'little', 'low', 'fixer', 'upper', 'quite', 'pointless', 'song', 'fun', 'film', 'seem', 'take', 'quite', 'queue', 'x', 'men', 'film', 'basic', 'setup', 'shot', 'film', 'us', 'bottom', 'line', 'people', 'say', 'beauty', 'beast', 'little', 'mermaid', 'well', 'right', 'gorgeously', 'animate', 'fantastic', 'music', 'memorable', 'character', 'great', 'story', 'frozen', 'surely', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'one', 'disney', 'great']","[17, 16, 1, 319, 20, 9, 28, 1483, 461, 21, 30, 13, 468, 119, 8, 7, 4, 18, 165, 18, 610, 8, 121, 350, 763, 2, 29, 55, 2676, 7, 603, 125, 29, 4, 124, 1493, 68, 884, 8, 25, 28, 32, 45, 8, 109, 92, 26, 333, 113, 85, 12, 18, 92, 156, 35, 2714, 42, 129, 41, 894, 560, 12, 456, 156, 9, 12, 92, 16, 106, 1704, 2, 163, 58, 5, 225, 4465, 11, 1445, 633, 30, 13, 36, 20, 287, 779, 202, 45, 11, 253, 268, 11, 57, 149, 203, 233, 661, 562, 2, 21, 93, 1147, 75, 1906, 714, 33, 1132, 65, 31, 1460, 398, 43, 1787, 28, 100, 21, 96, 1148, 158, 8, 1131, 43, 75, 48, 1023, 772, 737, 124, 898, 11, 125, 3, 75, 55, 124, 4466, 1365, 459, 3, 1088, 3000, 1103, 3, 919, 2469, 213, 46, 35, 149, 203, 48, 422, 18, 130, 3602, 38, 253, 58, 268, 8, 25, 12, 5, 960, 361, 1279, 20, 10, 2, 25]"

291,9,"It seems that Frozen, much like Disney's other more modern animations, is one of those films that you either fall head over heels for, or you find it a bit unremarkable. Personally I loved this film and found it to be a great addition to the long line of classic Disney animations. I would even say that Frozen could be the best Disney film since the Renaissance in the 1990s (The Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast etc.) and is much better than Tangled, which many people have been comparing to this.Beautiful animation, fantastic character design (if you exclude of Olaf) and a great soundtrack make this a must see.My only problem is that the plot seems fairly rushed and weaker than other Disney films, The main villain's motives didn't seem developed enough as other Disney villains (or as scary for that reason, and Elsa didn't have enough screen time for my liking.One of Disney's darker films with breath-taking songs make this absolutely magnificent.","['seem', 'frozen', 'much', 'like', 'disney', 'modern', 'animation', 'one', 'film', 'either', 'fall', 'head', 'heel', 'find', 'bit', 'unremarkable', 'personally', 'love', 'film', 'found', 'great', 'addition', 'long', 'line', 'classic', 'disney', 'animation', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'frozen', 'could', 'best', 'disney', 'film', 'since', 'renaissance', 'lion', 'king', 'aladdin', 'mulan', 'beauty', 'beast', 'etc', 'much', 'well', 'tangle', 'many', 'people', 'compare', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'character', 'design', 'exclude', 'olaf', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'must', 'see', 'problem', 'plot', 'seem', 'fairly', 'rush', 'weaker', 'disney', 'film', 'main', 'villain', 'motif', 'seem', 'developed', 'enough', 'disney', 'villain', 'scary', 'reason', 'elsa', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'like', 'one', 'disney', 'darker', 'film', 'breath', 'take', 'song', 'make', 'absolutely', 'magnificent']","[75, 5, 31, 9, 2, 324, 21, 10, 3, 353, 186, 317, 2796, 71, 95, 2303, 520, 6, 3, 231, 25, 1000, 169, 213, 69, 2, 21, 26, 28, 35, 5, 54, 34, 2, 3, 98, 465, 152, 97, 485, 931, 149, 203, 430, 31, 18, 83, 61, 46, 350, 93, 21, 253, 8, 424, 2954, 32, 25, 225, 14, 236, 16, 198, 52, 75, 890, 525, 2413, 2, 3, 119, 104, 1896, 75, 610, 164, 2, 104, 1634, 180, 4, 164, 369, 20, 9, 10, 2, 1240, 3, 990, 55, 11, 14, 292, 935]"
292,8,"A very liberal take on the Hans Christian Andersen ""Snow Queen"", has Walt Disney animation forcefully returning back to its roots, whilst learning heaps from their fruitful cooperation with Pixar. With top-notch animation directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee instill heart into proceedings, but reimplanting the musical magic of the pre-1960s classic cartoons. Princess Else (Idina Menzel) was born with a tremendous gift, able to create beautiful icy structures out of nothing. However her power is so immense, creating a risk to her loved ones. Despite the loving care of her parents she becomes afraid of her rampaging powers, especially after she accidentally injures her sister Anna (Kristen Bell). Else locks herself away, becoming a recluse detached from her beloved Anna, who slowly grows up full of joy of life and explosive happiness, untouched even by the death of her parents.When Else turns 18 she is to become queen of the kingdom, but fear causes her to cast a spell of eternal winter to encapsulate the land. As Else runs away into the high-rise mountains, Anna goes after her in an attempt to save the kingdom. She is soon joined by the ice seller Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusted reindeer dog Sven, as well as by the magical snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) in a touching adventure fraught with trials and tribulations...""Frozen"" possesses a musical zest, which hasn't featured in Pixar movies, but once was a hallmark of Disney animations. These traditions are effortlessly immersed into the beautifully told epic journey of friendship and timeless love. The amount of singing and dancing, especially in the opening half of the movie, comes somewhat as a surprise, but even more unexpectedly it never seems out-of-place as if coming from a bygone era of filmmaking. Seamlessly capturing the inner child, ""Frozen"" adds some spectacular imagery in ice, making it a magical journey for both kids and adults. Rife with some witty humour as well as the odd bout of slapstick, this is almost the perfect mix. Even the ending is sung in the perfect note, despite my misgivings of a trite well-worn route. That said Disney's newest feature is hardly adventurous, rather treading a easily anticipated dramatic path, which settles to deliver the expected in a fabulously enticing manner with beautiful surrounding, exquisite costumes or endearing characters (with the heat-loving snowman and the dog-deer Sven a special treat).Of special note is the lack of a defined villain, as the story is built around the concepts of human frailty, lack of internal confidence and mistakes that lead to terrible consequences. The antagonist is a tragic character of old, not by definition or nature, but by fate.Some quibbles should be made about script logic, especially the character and contradictory actions of Hans (Santino Fontana) raising an eyebrow or two.","['liberal', 'take', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'walt', 'disney', 'animation', 'forcefully', 'return', 'back', 'root', 'whilst', 'learn', 'heap', 'fruitful', 'cooperation', 'pixar', 'top', 'notch', 'animation', 'director', 'chris', 'buck', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'instill', 'heart', 'proceeding', 'reimplanting', 'musical', 'magic', 'pre', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'princess', 'else', 'idina', 'menzel', 'born', 'tremendous', 'gift', 'able', 'create', 'beautiful', 'icy', 'structure', 'nothing', 'however', 'power', 'immense', 'create', 'risk', 'love', 'one', 'despite', 'love', 'care', 'parent', 'becomes', 'afraid', 'rampage', 'power', 'especially', 'accidentally', 'injures', 'sister', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'else', 'lock', 'away', 'become', 'recluse', 'detach', 'beloved', 'anna', 'slowly', 'grows', 'full', 'joy', 'life', 'explosive', 'happiness', 'untouched', 'even', 'death', 'parent', 'else', 'turn', 'become', 'queen', 'kingdom', 'fear', 'cause', 'cast', 'spell', 'eternal', 'winter', 'encapsulate', 'land', 'else', 'run', 'away', 'high', 'rise', 'mountain', 'anna', 'go', 'attempt', 'save', 'kingdom', 'soon', 'join', 'ice', 'seller', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'trust', 'reindeer', 'dog', 'sven', 'well', 'magical', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'josh', 'gad', 'touch', 'adventure', 'fraught', 'trial', 'tribulation', 'frozen', 'posse', 'musical', 'zest', 'feature', 'pixar', 'movie', 'hallmark', 'disney', 'animation', 'tradition', 'effortlessly', 'immerse', 'beautifully', 'told', 'epic', 'journey', 'friendship', 'timeless', 'love', 'amount', 'sing', 'dance', 'especially', 'opening', 'half', 'movie', 'come', 'somewhat', 'surprise', 'even', 'unexpectedly', 'never', 'seem', 'place', 'come', 'bygone', 'era', 'filmmaking', 'seamlessly', 'capture', 'inner', 'child', 'frozen', 'add', 'spectacular', 'imagery', 'ice', 'make', 'magical', 'journey', 'kid', 'adult', 'rife', 'witty', 'humour', 'well', 'odd', 'bout', 'slapstick', 'almost', 'perfect', 'mix', 'even', 'end', 'sung', 'perfect', 'note', 'despite', 'misgiving', 'trite', 'well', 'worn', 'route', 'say', 'disney', 'new', 'feature', 'hardly', 'adventurous', 'rather', 'tread', 'easily', 'anticipate', 'dramatic', 'path', 'settle', 'deliver', 'expect', 'fabulously', 'entice', 'manner', 'beautiful', 'surround', 'exquisite', 'costume', 'endear', 'character', 'heat', 'love', 'snowman', 'dog', 'deer', 'sven', 'special', 'treat', 'special', 'note', 'lack', 'define', 'villain', 'story', 'built', 'around', 'concept', 'human', 'frailty', 'lack', 'internal', 'confidence', 'mistake', 'lead', 'terrible', 'consequence', 'antagonist', 'tragic', 'character', 'old', 'definition', 'nature', 'fate', 'quibble', 'make', 'script', 'logic', 'especially', 'character', 'contradictory', 'action', 'han', 'santino', 'fontana', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'two']","[4310, 55, 44, 245, 339, 39, 49, 410, 2, 21, 4467, 385, 74, 885, 1130, 347, 194, 239, 1129, 21, 770, 526, 490, 464, 416, 80, 3612, 51, 150, 1394, 69, 314, 29, 270, 141, 116, 589, 1869, 832, 294, 134, 93, 453, 1795, 156, 110, 24, 3042, 134, 1386, 6, 10, 313, 6, 293, 118, 380, 558, 24, 121, 300, 1928, 15, 7, 162, 146, 270, 382, 101, 179, 2588, 3670, 1280, 7, 2743, 1291, 246, 738, 79, 1501, 3622, 28, 517, 118, 270, 113, 179, 49, 77, 187, 328, 227, 858, 310, 105, 4277, 757, 270, 233, 101, 206, 880, 214, 7, 13, 448, 111, 77, 580, 813, 33, 2199, 67, 455, 377, 836, 151, 1095, 181, 18, 170, 45, 32, 275, 257, 260, 326, 3580, 5, 1215, 51, 229, 194, 1, 2337, 2, 21, 1071, 2488, 3014, 529, 511, 566, 337, 1003, 1566, 6, 624, 63, 1067, 121, 631, 346, 1, 40, 572, 445, 28, 3159, 88, 75, 188, 40, 942, 3671, 4068, 611, 1154, 70, 5, 269, 671, 2253, 33, 14, 170, 337, 60, 147, 1216, 732, 18, 1258, 4468, 1751, 173, 175, 1119, 28, 41, 684, 175, 625, 313, 2144, 18, 3480, 1650, 35, 2, 108, 229, 976, 1710, 191, 2780, 403, 2075, 1213, 1347, 2037, 1050, 131, 3672, 1377, 93, 1353, 2181, 1336, 1478, 8, 1601, 6, 45, 1095, 1905, 181, 316, 682, 316, 625, 273, 1206, 104, 12, 787, 200, 693, 515, 4469, 273, 1517, 2077, 967, 248, 432, 1560, 634, 1493, 8, 64, 1585, 1094, 1648, 14, 395, 1464, 121, 8, 4470, 345, 44, 688, 665, 760, 4471, 42]"

Beautiful cinematography and art direction, but above all incredible imagination.The soundtrack is definitely the best this year, the opening vocals themselves set the mood for a very melodious adventure. Hope Disney can keep following up with such exquisite features.This is definitely a film for all ages.A pleasant surprise was the short in the beginning with our beloved Mickey and gang, with sharp displays and contrasts between yesteryear 2D animation and the new 3D Technicolor animation.

294,1,"Last Disney animated movie I have watched was already a long time ago. But always had good memories of Disney magical and musical worlds that they created.There was so much hype around Frozen and with the fact that they won 2 oscars with this, I finally put myself to watch it.Oh how I regretted my decision. The precious memory I had of Disney's magic was totally gone in an instant. Has Disney quality story telling really come down to this? Disappointed. Really don't know what the hype was about. It was a mess of a story with too many potholes. The Kingdom is portrayed as static as your typical Disney theme park. It had no soul, no atmosphere.The narrative of the story was rushed, you don't get any background explanation why Elsa was born with her powers and why others did not. The trolls saved Ana once, why couldn't they do it again, yes they said it was her heart this time not her head, which is a lame excuse, but okay. Besides, they misled her that she needed a true love kiss, which spun the story into confusion. If an adult finds it confusing, imagine how kids feel watching this?Talking about kids, the message of the story is not a good one for the kids. Ana was getting head over heels with the first man she meets (Hans), and then loving another man she meets even shorter of a time span than the first one. Crazy thing is she didn't knew she loved Christoph until her life needed to be saved. But turn out she doesn't need a mans true love to save her life in the first place. That was some crazy stuff happening right there, and it will send a wrong message to kids that fooling around with love is apparently okay according in this Disney movie....as if Disney says doesnt matter who you fool around with, as long as you find true love...Apart from the catchy song ""Let it go"" the queen Elsa really was not a memorable character. She was not coherent in her ways, indecisive and at times borderline evil and mental. Not a likable character. She was able to control her powers for all these years, and suddenly losing control over it doesn't make sense. Why doesn't Elsa push forward Ana to be queen, if Elsa was so afraid of letting people know her secret powers?And then the not so convincing silly plot twist where Prince Hans turn out to be this scheming evil person. Where it yet again send kids into confusing why this Prince charming seemingly turn into a bad person overnight. That is some lazy screenplay writing right there. Mess of a story, enough said. One star given for the effort, that's it.","['last', 'disney', 'animate', 'movie', 'watch', 'already', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'always', 'good', 'memory', 'disney', 'magical', 'musical', 'world', 'create', 'much', 'hype', 'around', 'frozen', 'fact', 'oscar', 'finally', 'put', 'watch', 'oh', 'regret', 'decision', 'precious', 'memory', 'disney', 'magic', 'totally', 'go', 'instant', 'disney', 'quality', 'story', 'tell', 'really', 'come', 'disappointed', 'really', 'know', 'hype', 'mess', 'story', 'many', 'pothole', 'kingdom', 'portrayed', 'static', 'typical', 'disney', 'theme', 'park', 'soul', 'atmosphere', 'narrative', 'story', 'rush', 'get', 'background', 'explanation', 'elsa', 'born', 'power', 'others', 'troll', 'save', 'ana', 'yes', 'say', 'heart', 'time', 'head', 'lame', 'excuse', 'okay', 'besides', 'mislead', 'need', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'spun', 'story', 'confusion', 'adult', 'find', 'confuse', 'imagine', 'kid', 'feel', 'watch', 'talk', 'kid', 'message', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'kid', 'ana', 'get', 'head', 'heel', 'first', 'man', 'meet', 'han', 'love', 'another', 'man', 'meet', 'even', 'shorter', 'time', 'span', 'first', 'one', 'crazy', 'thing', 'knew', 'love', 'christoph', 'life', 'need', 'save', 'turn', 'need', 'man', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'life', 'first', 'place', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'happen', 'right', 'send', 'wrong', 'message', 'kid', 'fooling', 'around', 'love', 'apparently', 'okay', 'accord', 'disney', 'movie', 'disney', 'say', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'fool', 'around', 'long', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'apart', 'catchy', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'queen', 'elsa', 'really', 'memorable', 'character', 'coherent', 'way', 'indecisive', 'time', 'borderline', 'evil', 'mental', 'likable', 'character', 'able', 'control', 'power', 'year', 'suddenly', 'lose', 'control', 'make', 'sense', 'elsa', 'push', 'forward', 'ana', 'queen', 'elsa', 'afraid', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'secret', 'power', 'convincing', 'silly', 'plot', 'twist', 'prince', 'han', 'turn', 'scheme', 'evil', 'person', 'yet', 'send', 'kid', 'confuse', 'prince', 'charm', 'seemingly', 'turn', 'bad', 'person', 'overnight', 'lazy', 'screenplay', 'write', 'right', 'mess', 'story', 'enough', 'say', 'one', 'star', 'give', 'effort']","[197, 2, 38, 1, 23, 397, 169, 20, 683, 163, 17, 412, 2, 170, 51, 126, 134, 31, 406, 200, 5, 201, 302, 241, 196, 23, 425, 1900, 758, 2489, 412, 2, 150, 557, 13, 982, 2, 283, 12, 143, 22, 40, 476, 22, 56, 406, 1025, 12, 61, 77, 918, 376, 2, 226, 2336, 1074, 1380, 802, 12, 525, 19, 617, 806, 4, 589, 24, 247, 123, 111, 929, 325, 35, 80, 20, 317, 1344, 1229, 420, 877, 4473, 99, 62, 6, 372, 4474, 12, 2767, 147, 71, 875, 1137, 60, 53, 23, 178, 60, 185, 12, 17, 10, 60, 929, 19, 317, 2796, 36, 145, 244, 44, 6, 102, 145, 244, 28, 4475, 20, 1789, 36, 10, 1008, 43, 488, 6, 1808, 79, 99, 111, 113, 99, 145, 62, 6, 111, 79, 36, 188, 1008, 698, 290, 130, 1968, 280, 185, 60, 200, 6, 755, 420, 2368, 2, 1, 2, 35, 375, 1959, 200, 169, 71, 62, 6, 512, 266, 11, 30, 13, 49, 4, 22, 268, 8, 3500, 50, 20, 277, 2132, 402, 8, 294, 128, 24, 47, 1033, 489, 128, 14, 217, 4, 809, 571, 929, 49, 4, 558, 30, 46, 56, 508, 24, 2032, 847, 52, 129, 82, 44, 113, 1467, 277, 441, 182, 1968, 60, 875, 82, 235, 1161, 113, 65, 441, 4419, 1373, 1027, 165, 130, 1025, 12, 164, 35, 10, 249, 57, 575]"

300,6,"After all the hype I heard about this film, I had to get myself to watch it. Very loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson's The Snow Queen, Frozen is about newly crowned Queen Elsa, who has magical powers that can turn objects into ice. Under duress, she accidentally freezes her hometown and turns the season into infinite winter. Meanwhile, her sister, Anna, teams up with mountain man Kristoff and little snowman Olaf to find Elsa and convince her to bring summer back to the town.After watching it, I thought the film wasn't too bad. It has a somewhat intriguing intro that shows Elsa accidentally hitting Anna unconscious with a blast of ice from her powers, making her shutting herself out of the real world so she could protect Anna. This all leads to the intriguing parts where Elsa grows up to be Queen and looses control of her powers, turning the town into snow and all the residents against her. Finally, it all leads to a somewhat exciting mission by Anna and company to find Elsa.The plot itself has some exciting and thrilling sequences, but it is consumed by many moments when the characters tried to insert comic relief. It seemed that whenever there is an opportunity, the characters attempt to be funny, doing away with any moments that are supposed to be suspenseful or serious. This is especially true with the Olaf character (I frankly thought he was annoying).Most of the characters were OK, but didn't stand out as too memorable or had qualities that blew me away like characters in the movies Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King did. They acted like everyday people who tried to be hip or funny. Only the serious and powerful, yet vulnerable Elsa had any redeeming qualities.The songs in the film weren't bad and were quite catchy; the song ""Let It Go"" that I hear kids belt out everywhere wasn't as cringe worthy that I thought it might be.Lastly, I thought the animation work was OK. I have a partial liking to hand drawn animation, as I believe it looks more lively, colorful and vibrant. The CGI makes it as if I was watching a Pixar-made movie.Overall, it's a pretty average Disney film. It has its exciting moments, but does not have that special ""Disney touch"" that makes earlier animated movies in the 1990s and earlier iconic.Grade C+","['hype', 'heard', 'film', 'get', 'watch', 'loosely', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'frozen', 'newly', 'crown', 'queen', 'elsa', 'magical', 'power', 'turn', 'object', 'ice', 'duress', 'accidentally', 'freeze', 'hometown', 'turn', 'season', 'infinite', 'winter', 'meanwhile', 'sister', 'anna', 'team', 'mountain', 'man', 'kristoff', 'little', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'find', 'elsa', 'convince', 'bring', 'summer', 'back', 'town', 'watch', 'thought', 'film', 'bad', 'somewhat', 'intrigue', 'intro', 'show', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'anna', 'unconscious', 'blast', 'ice', 'power', 'make', 'shut', 'real', 'world', 'could', 'protect', 'anna', 'lead', 'intrigue', 'part', 'elsa', 'grows', 'queen', 'loos', 'control', 'power', 'turn', 'town', 'snow', 'resident', 'finally', 'lead', 'somewhat', 'excite', 'mission', 'anna', 'company', 'find', 'elsa', 'plot', 'excite', 'thrill', 'sequence', 'consume', 'many', 'moment', 'character', 'try', 'insert', 'comic', 'relief', 'seem', 'whenever', 'opportunity', 'character', 'attempt', 'funny', 'away', 'moment', 'suppose', 'suspenseful', 'serious', 'especially', 'true', 'olaf', 'character', 'frankly', 'thought', 'annoy', 'character', 'ok', 'stand', 'memorable', 'quality', 'blew', 'away', 'like', 'character', 'movie', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'act', 'like', 'everyday', 'people', 'try', 'hip', 'funny', 'serious', 'powerful', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'elsa', 'redeem', 'quality', 'song', 'film', 'bad', 'quite', 'catchy', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'hear', 'kid', 'belt', 'everywhere', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'thought', 'might', 'lastly', 'thought', 'animation', 'work', 'ok', 'partial', 'like', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'believe', 'look', 'lively', 'colorful', 'vibrant', 'cgi', 'make', 'watch', 'pixar', 'make', 'movie', 'overall', 'pretty', 'average', 'disney', 'film', 'excite', 'moment', 'special', 'disney', 'touch', 'make', 'earlier', 'animate', 'movie', 'earlier', 'iconic', 'grade', 'c']","[406, 357, 3, 19, 23, 696, 256, 44, 245, 467, 39, 49, 5, 1587, 722, 49, 4, 170, 24, 113, 1491, 33, 4476, 300, 282, 4208, 113, 1040, 2425, 105, 1104, 15, 7, 486, 214, 145, 67, 48, 45, 32, 71, 4, 1444, 221, 205, 74, 602, 23, 92, 3, 65, 572, 1723, 3625, 78, 4, 300, 234, 7, 2490, 1712, 33, 24, 14, 686, 195, 126, 54, 513, 7, 248, 1723, 94, 4, 1291, 49, 3673, 128, 24, 113, 602, 39, 241, 248, 572, 447, 3674, 7, 789, 71, 4, 52, 447, 1019, 502, 3172, 61, 133, 8, 87, 3071, 309, 297, 75, 1267, 759, 8, 448, 85, 101, 133, 473, 2797, 835, 121, 62, 32, 8, 1547, 92, 238, 8, 477, 361, 268, 283, 2061, 101, 9, 8, 1, 149, 203, 152, 97, 112, 9, 2021, 46, 87, 2943, 85, 835, 439, 182, 2491, 4, 1199, 283, 11, 3, 65, 124, 266, 11, 30, 13, 568, 60, 1276, 879, 1929, 790, 92, 252, 2260, 92, 21, 107, 477, 3675, 9, 323, 747, 21, 220, 66, 1559, 1427, 1596, 555, 14, 23, 194, 14, 1, 166, 136, 921, 2, 3, 447, 133, 316, 2, 260, 14, 846, 38, 1, 846, 1807, 1552, 1781]"
301,-,"It was late in 2013 when Frozen came out and it was a year later when I finally got to watch it, although it did not feel like it was a film that had come out so long ago because it does seem to be everywhere: endless DVDs of it in homes with children, songs on CD in cars for children, sing-along versions released into cinemas for this Christmas, and many other things that make it feel very recent and relevant. This success is hard to put to one side, but I did, and I did not go into Frozen expecting it to be the film that so many fans claim it is; which is the right way to go because this is not the perfect film some claim, even if it is really quite good in many areas.The plot is one of them. The film starts a little awkwardly as we are introduced to two sisters, one of whom has magic ice powers, the other does not – we are asked to go with this and the events that follow because they set up the plot. Once over these rushed establishing scenes, the film settles down to be a story of two sisters; the romantic threads involving men are of course a big part of the story, but mostly it is about these two female characters – they are the leads and the story revolves around them rather than who they may or may not love. I like this as a theme and I also liked that it wasn't done as a overreaction – with male characters or any romantic subplot rejected, just that the writing was balanced and felt natural.The story plays out well. I was surprised that the comedy was lighter than I had expected, with fewer laughs throughout the film, mostly from Olaf. As a musical I could see why the songs and the setpieces have been so popular, but also why they didn't work for me so well. There is a real sense of Glee (the show, not the emotion) in all the songs and performances, with several of the bigger numbers reminding me of the type of things you see on America's Got Talent and shows of that ilk. This makes for big showy numbers, but also feels a tad over the top for my taste; catchy and ""big"" for sure, but very specific to what they are doing. They worked though, and I didn't feel they were out of place in the film, just had to admit that they were not really to my preference. In the end it stands as an enjoyable film, with a good blend of story, musical numbers, action, and comedy. Is it as good as the popularity since release suggests? Probably not, but for the limitations of what it does, it does still work.","['late', 'frozen', 'come', 'year', 'later', 'finally', 'get', 'watch', 'although', 'feel', 'like', 'film', 'come', 'long', 'ago', 'seem', 'everywhere', 'endless', 'dvd', 'home', 'child', 'song', 'cd', 'car', 'child', 'sing', 'along', 'version', 'release', 'cinema', 'christmas', 'many', 'thing', 'make', 'feel', 'recent', 'relevant', 'success', 'hard', 'put', 'one', 'side', 'go', 'frozen', 'expect', 'film', 'many', 'fan', 'claim', 'right', 'way', 'go', 'perfect', 'film', 'claim', 'even', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'many', 'area', 'plot', 'one', 'film', 'start', 'little', 'awkwardly', 'introduce', 'two', 'sister', 'one', 'magic', 'ice', 'power', 'ask', 'go', 'event', 'follow', 'set', 'plot', 'rush', 'establish', 'scene', 'film', 'settle', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'romantic', 'thread', 'involve', 'men', 'course', 'big', 'part', 'story', 'mostly', 'two', 'female', 'character', 'lead', 'story', 'revolves', 'around', 'rather', 'may', 'may', 'love', 'like', 'theme', 'also', 'like', 'overreaction', 'male', 'character', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'reject', 'write', 'balance', 'felt', 'natural', 'story', 'play', 'well', 'surprised', 'comedy', 'lighter', 'expect', 'laugh', 'throughout', 'film', 'mostly', 'olaf', 'musical', 'could', 'see', 'song', 'setpieces', 'popular', 'also', 'work', 'well', 'real', 'sense', 'glee', 'show', 'emotion', 'song', 'performance', 'several', 'big', 'number', 'remind', 'type', 'thing', 'see', 'america', 'get', 'talent', 'show', 'ilk', 'make', 'big', 'showy', 'number', 'also', 'feel', 'tad', 'top', 'taste', 'catchy', 'big', 'sure', 'specific', 'work', 'though', 'feel', 'place', 'film', 'admit', 'really', 'preference', 'end', 'stand', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'good', 'blend', 'story', 'musical', 'number', 'action', 'comedy', 'good', 'popularity', 'since', 'release', 'suggests', 'probably', 'limitation', 'still', 'work']","[530, 5, 40, 47, 358, 241, 19, 23, 255, 53, 9, 3, 40, 169, 683, 75, 879, 1716, 540, 533, 70, 11, 2008, 1406, 70, 63, 172, 435, 288, 543, 743, 61, 43, 14, 53, 399, 1335, 577, 307, 196, 10, 387, 13, 5, 131, 3, 61, 176, 1042, 130, 50, 13, 175, 3, 1042, 28, 22, 124, 17, 61, 1266, 52, 10, 3, 120, 48, 3120, 736, 42, 15, 10, 150, 33, 24, 581, 13, 618, 378, 144, 52, 525, 2170, 90, 3, 2037, 12, 42, 15, 393, 2197, 584, 459, 228, 106, 94, 12, 567, 42, 237, 8, 248, 12, 2261, 200, 191, 171, 171, 6, 9, 226, 27, 9, 4318, 431, 8, 393, 2492, 1836, 165, 677, 155, 1660, 12, 204, 18, 703, 279, 4477, 131, 190, 296, 3, 567, 32, 51, 54, 16, 11, 559, 27, 107, 18, 195, 217, 1548, 78, 240, 11, 493, 608, 106, 184, 1047, 524, 43, 16, 3676, 19, 800, 78, 14, 106, 184, 27, 53, 2223, 239, 1120, 266, 106, 207, 1586, 107, 100, 53, 188, 3, 637, 22, 2798, 41, 361, 306, 3, 17, 1551, 12, 51, 184, 345, 279, 17, 1872, 98, 288, 4478, 210, 2493, 68, 107]"
302,7,"I cannot decide what my problem is with this film. I narrowed it down to 2 possibilities: either 1) there is too much singing and silliness or 2) I am just not 10 years old anymore. I guess it is mostly the latter.Those who have not seen Frozen probably probably still heard about ""Let it go"", a song from the movie that went viral on social media. It is a good song and Frozen has several of them, all of which are nice but which, in my opinion, belong on an separately sold album. They are essentially all standalone songs and they take up half of the movie. I don't remember Alladin or Beauty and the Beast being so singy. Frozen is just short of being a musical and I do not like musicals.The basic story is about a Nordic princess with ice superpowers that end up causing her and her kingdom a lot of trouble as she struggles to control those powers.What is nice about the plot is that it is not obvious or overly simplistic and the final moral message goes just a bit off the beaten path. The whole thing has a certain welcome asymmetry about it. It borrows somewhat from the Snow Queen fairytale, which was itself not your standard story.Nothing special about the acting though. It is all good, but a few months after seeing the movie, the only memorable character is the comic relief snowman, Olaf, played by Josh Gad. The rest of the characters are a bit generic. Of course the two male and the two female leads are going to be pretty, their voices smooth and their bodies shaped according to the old-fashioned Disney standards for protagonists. The most memorable thing about them is the singing.The art is good, probably because it paces itself and knows when to strike the viewer with the money shot in order the make the largest impression. The thing about snow though is that it does not need a lot of texture or color. Of course it poses its own challenges when you have to animate its movement and that is done well.Frozen is a solid production, but it is not revolutionary.","['decide', 'problem', 'film', 'narrow', 'possibility', 'either', 'much', 'sing', 'silliness', 'year', 'old', 'anymore', 'guess', 'mostly', 'latter', 'see', 'frozen', 'probably', 'probably', 'still', 'heard', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'movie', 'go', 'viral', 'social', 'medium', 'good', 'song', 'frozen', 'several', 'nice', 'opinion', 'belong', 'separately', 'sell', 'album', 'essentially', 'standalone', 'song', 'take', 'half', 'movie', 'remember', 'alladin', 'beauty', 'beast', 'singy', 'frozen', 'short', 'musical', 'like', 'musical', 'basic', 'story', 'nordic', 'princess', 'ice', 'superpower', 'end', 'cause', 'kingdom', 'lot', 'trouble', 'struggle', 'control', 'power', 'nice', 'plot', 'obvious', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'final', 'moral', 'message', 'go', 'bit', 'beaten', 'path', 'whole', 'thing', 'certain', 'welcome', 'asymmetry', 'borrows', 'somewhat', 'snow', 'queen', 'fairytale', 'standard', 'story', 'nothing', 'special', 'act', 'though', 'good', 'month', 'see', 'movie', 'memorable', 'character', 'comic', 'relief', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'played', 'josh', 'gad', 'rest', 'character', 'bit', 'generic', 'course', 'two', 'male', 'two', 'female', 'lead', 'go', 'pretty', 'voice', 'smooth', 'body', 'shape', 'accord', 'old', 'fashion', 'disney', 'standard', 'protagonist', 'memorable', 'thing', 'sing', 'art', 'good', 'probably', 'pace', 'know', 'strike', 'viewer', 'money', 'shot', 'order', 'make', 'large', 'impression', 'thing', 'snow', 'though', 'need', 'lot', 'texture', 'color', 'course', 'pose', 'challenge', 'animate', 'movement', 'well', 'frozen', 'solid', 'production', 'revolutionary']","[491, 198, 3, 3542, 2123, 353, 31, 63, 4479, 47, 64, 892, 388, 567, 955, 16, 5, 210, 210, 68, 357, 30, 13, 11, 1, 13, 3677, 1522, 1294, 17, 11, 5, 608, 192, 258, 2784, 4480, 718, 2254, 1668, 11, 55, 346, 1, 391, 4481, 149, 203, 5, 263, 51, 9, 51, 1088, 12, 1692, 29, 33, 3173, 41, 328, 77, 84, 1073, 639, 128, 24, 192, 52, 595, 1200, 1556, 817, 551, 185, 13, 95, 4482, 1347, 127, 43, 563, 1108, 3678, 572, 39, 49, 756, 633, 12, 156, 316, 112, 100, 17, 860, 16, 1, 268, 8, 309, 297, 45, 32, 507, 275, 257, 303, 8, 95, 969, 228, 42, 431, 42, 237, 248, 13, 136, 86, 1878, 1220, 1317, 2368, 64, 974, 2, 633, 354, 268, 43, 63, 749, 17, 210, 564, 56, 1193, 479, 661, 1103, 496, 14, 977, 1118, 43, 39, 100, 99, 84, 1148, 651, 228, 2799, 1589, 38, 886, 18, 5, 664, 700, 2494]"

The story is a heartwarming sisterhood bond at its core layered with frozen fantasy. And it was handled pretty well. You cannot help but enjoy and delve into it. IT is refreshing to see a female lead animated movie that is well told. Both the sisters are great and have good character development and are very likable, especially the younger one. And that is mainly because of awesome voice acting by Kristen bell. I just loved it. Other characters were good too. Really liked that living snowman, he was really funny. The animation was great. The frozen stuff looked awesome. Also, Disney sure knows how to make great looking female characters. Both the sisters were beautiful. I feel like I have a crush on both of them. :p :pThe soundtrack was pretty good with some great pieces in it. Most of the songs were good too. Let it go especially, by far my favourite one in the movie. That being said, the frequency of the songs was a little too much and it was really annoying.

305,6,"Inspired by (rather than adapted from) Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, Disney's latest offering, Frozen, is a light, amiable singsong through the ice and snow that will entertain most, delight the young and eventually fall into place behind The Lion King, Aladdin and numerous other classics in the Disney catalogue. Princesses Anna and Elsa are as close as good fairytale sisters can be until Anna inadvertently unleashes her ice power upon her younger sibling and almost kills her. Her parents decide the best way to prevent it happening again is to hide Anna from the world, and prevent her from seeing Elsa by locking her in her room. Their parents die some time later, the isolation continues, much to the dismay of Elsa, until the decision is made to open the gates to the world for Anna's coronation. In a bout of misunderstanding, Anna (Kristen Bell) almost terminates Elsa (Idina Menzel) again, horrifies the townsfolk and takes to the hills. Elsa recruits reluctant ice salesman Kristoff (Jonathon Groff) and his trusty reindeer, Sven, and aims to bring her back to end the winter that has sprung up in her wake.Frozen has the feel of a musical (à la Les Misérables) rather than a comedy film with songs (The Muppets) inasmuch as the songs aren't used as condiments to the meal but as principal ingredients, and there is a danger of this wrenching the viewer out of the film instead of propelling them along with it. Most of the songs very quickly fade in the memory and, with a solitary exception, I cannot name a single one less than a day after the event. The exception, however, is the mighty fine (and, I predict, the soon to be Oscar-winning) Let It Go. In a film that lacks magic, this is the sequence that makes the ice truly sparkle and stands out as the moment Frozen becomes a film worth watching. In the transformation of Anna as dejected queen into icy vamp, she firmly supplants Ariel as the most fanciable animated character on the big screen.The animation in this sequence also comes alive. From the opening scenes of water and ice being cut into blocks, the backdrops are the stars of Frozen but in the latter part of Let It Go, the character animators finally hit their strides and we are given a character that is as watchable and complete as the scenery.Disney has, in the past, become a byword for schmaltz and sanitized stories. Take another look at Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame for stories that have been watered down for delicate audiences. Here, again, Disney holds back on the trauma and, whereas in Bambi we were left in no doubt as to the fate of his mother, here it is almost a suggestion and glossed over quickly. So much of Frozen feels like a trip of shortcuts when it should be a journey of adventure, false turns and new avenues.Frozen also suffers from the lack of a bona fide villain. Yes, the Duke of Wesleton (Alan Tudyk) has his moments and for an awful moment it looks as though Anna may transmogrify into something evil but there is nothing we can really sink our teeth into. The comedy character, Olaf (Josh Gad), the snowman, adds some comedy variation but even he is amusing rather than outright funny.Frozen is a sweet, easy fairytale that will distract your children from killing each other one rainy Saturday and most Disney animations are worth having on the DVD shelf eventually. But therein rests the issue: this is a Disney film and not a Pixar event.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","['inspire', 'rather', 'adapt', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'disney', 'late', 'offering', 'frozen', 'light', 'amiable', 'singsong', 'ice', 'snow', 'entertain', 'delight', 'young', 'eventually', 'fall', 'place', 'behind', 'lion', 'king', 'aladdin', 'numerous', 'classic', 'disney', 'catalogue', 'princess', 'anna', 'elsa', 'close', 'good', 'fairytale', 'sister', 'anna', 'inadvertently', 'unleashes', 'ice', 'power', 'upon', 'young', 'sibling', 'almost', 'kill', 'parent', 'decide', 'best', 'way', 'prevent', 'happen', 'hide', 'anna', 'world', 'prevent', 'see', 'elsa', 'lock', 'room', 'parent', 'die', 'time', 'later', 'isolation', 'continue', 'much', 'dismay', 'elsa', 'decision', 'make', 'open', 'gate', 'world', 'anna', 'coronation', 'bout', 'misunderstand', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'almost', 'terminates', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'horrifies', 'townsfolk', 'take', 'hill', 'elsa', 'recruit', 'reluctant', 'ice', 'salesman', 'kristoff', 'jonathon', 'groff', 'trusty', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'aim', 'bring', 'back', 'end', 'winter', 'sprung', 'wake', 'frozen', 'feel', 'musical', 'la', 'le', 'mi', 'rables', 'rather', 'comedy', 'film', 'song', 'muppets', 'inasmuch', 'song', 'use', 'condiment', 'meal', 'principal', 'ingredient', 'danger', 'wrench', 'viewer', 'film', 'instead', 'propel', 'along', 'song', 'quickly', 'fade', 'memory', 'solitary', 'exception', 'name', 'single', 'one', 'less', 'day', 'event', 'exception', 'however', 'mighty', 'fine', 'predict', 'soon', 'oscar', 'win', 'let', 'go', 'film', 'lack', 'magic', 'sequence', 'make', 'ice', 'truly', 'sparkle', 'stand', 'moment', 'frozen', 'becomes', 'film', 'worth', 'watch', 'transformation', 'anna', 'deject', 'queen', 'icy', 'vamp', 'firmly', 'supplants', 'ariel', 'fanciable', 'animate', 'character', 'big', 'screen', 'animation', 'sequence', 'also', 'come', 'alive', 'opening', 'scene', 'water', 'ice', 'cut', 'block', 'backdrop', 'star', 'frozen', 'latter', 'part', 'let', 'go', 'character', 'animator', 'finally', 'hit', 'stride', 'give', 'character', 'watchable', 'complete', 'scenery', 'disney', 'past', 'become', 'byword', 'schmaltz', 'sanitize', 'story', 'take', 'another', 'look', 'pocahontas', 'hunchback', 'notre', 'dame', 'story', 'water', 'delicate', 'audience', 'disney', 'hold', 'back', 'trauma', 'whereas', 'bambi', 'left', 'doubt', 'fate', 'mother', 'almost', 'suggestion', 'gloss', 'quickly', 'much', 'frozen', 'feel', 'like', 'trip', 'shortcut', 'journey', 'adventure', 'false', 'turn', 'new', 'avenue', 'frozen', 'also', 'suffers', 'lack', 'bona', 'fide', 'villain', 'yes', 'duke', 'wesleton', 'alan', 'tudyk', 'moment', 'awful', 'moment', 'look', 'though', 'anna', 'may', 'transmogrify', 'something', 'evil', 'nothing', 'really', 'sink', 'teeth', 'comedy', 'character', 'olaf', 'josh', 'gad', 'snowman', 'add', 'comedy', 'variation', 'even', 'amuse', 'rather', 'outright', 'funny', 'frozen', 'sweet', 'easy', 'fairytale', 'distract', 'child', 'kill', 'one', 'rainy', 'saturday', 'disney', 'animation', 'worth', 'dvd', 'shelf', 'eventually', 'therein', 'rest', 'issue', 'disney', 'film', 'pixar', 'event', 'review', 'squiss', 'subscribe', 'blog', 'like', 'facebook', 'page']","[500, 191, 912, 44, 245, 339, 39, 49, 2, 530, 1611, 5, 735, 4484, 33, 39, 243, 1062, 73, 652, 186, 188, 750, 152, 97, 485, 1874, 69, 2, 4485, 29, 7, 4, 351, 17, 756, 15, 7, 1274, 1884, 33, 24, 554, 73, 409, 173, 286, 118, 491, 34, 50, 1264, 290, 676, 7, 126, 1264, 16, 4, 382, 506, 118, 368, 20, 358, 600, 647, 31, 3175, 4, 758, 14, 318, 964, 126, 7, 343, 4468, 3176, 7, 162, 146, 173, 4, 141, 116, 4486, 55, 1930, 4, 2164, 33, 1443, 67, 4487, 377, 2263, 151, 181, 859, 221, 74, 41, 105, 4488, 1238, 5, 53, 51, 3680, 2066, 2079, 191, 279, 3, 11, 3513, 11, 158, 4489, 3681, 2685, 901, 2416, 479, 3, 208, 3177, 172, 11, 733, 3536, 412, 2778, 645, 183, 741, 10, 321, 138, 618, 645, 110, 2664, 470, 2392, 580, 302, 374, 30, 13, 3, 273, 150, 502, 14, 33, 329, 2226, 361, 133, 5, 380, 3, 254, 23, 1772, 7, 49, 453, 3178, 1915, 38, 8, 106, 369, 21, 502, 27, 40, 1301, 631, 90, 1013, 33, 723, 2258, 1821, 249, 5, 955, 94, 30, 13, 8, 812, 241, 234, 2795, 57, 8, 2495, 656, 1217, 2, 276, 179, 12, 55, 102, 66, 1646, 1524, 1525, 1453, 12, 1013, 3145, 159, 2, 655, 74, 3682, 1565, 2040, 330, 681, 1648, 883, 173, 3573, 2683, 733, 31, 5, 53, 9, 1066, 337, 326, 1950, 113, 108, 3620, 5, 27, 2369, 273, 104, 325, 762, 1134, 1426, 133, 874, 133, 66, 100, 7, 171, 89, 277, 156, 22, 2329, 4439, 279, 8, 32, 275, 257, 45, 269, 279, 2264, 28, 828, 191, 3002, 85, 5, 457, 454, 756, 1787, 70, 286, 10, 2779, 2, 21, 254, 540, 3031, 652, 303, 519, 2, 3, 194, 618, 161, 1643, 9, 2080, 2800]"
306,8,"I think Frozen is yet one of the best Disney-family movies. Though the main characters are girls, there are two boy characters in it as well. It tells us the typical love story every girl wants nowadays through the naive Anna, but shows us also what many teenagers fight with today through the story of the troubled Elsa, who's trying to find herself, but serve well as a good queen too. Though the story can make you cry at times, it's also funny, especially Olaf, the snowman's character, who makes a joke of everything. The actors have done a good job with their voices too, and the soundtrack is great, has many catchy songs. It is a very sweet story that shows you the importance of family, honesty, and love.","['think', 'frozen', 'yet', 'one', 'best', 'disney', 'family', 'movie', 'though', 'main', 'character', 'girl', 'two', 'boy', 'character', 'well', 'tell', 'u', 'typical', 'love', 'story', 'every', 'girl', 'want', 'nowadays', 'naive', 'anna', 'show', 'u', 'also', 'many', 'teenager', 'fight', 'today', 'story', 'troubled', 'elsa', 'try', 'find', 'serve', 'well', 'good', 'queen', 'though', 'story', 'make', 'cry', 'time', 'also', 'funny', 'especially', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'character', 'make', 'joke', 'everything', 'actor', 'good', 'job', 'voice', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'many', 'catchy', 'song', 'sweet', 'story', 'show', 'importance', 'family', 'honesty', 'love']","[37, 5, 182, 10, 34, 2, 72, 1, 100, 119, 8, 76, 42, 408, 8, 18, 143, 177, 376, 6, 12, 115, 76, 59, 1475, 1144, 7, 78, 177, 27, 61, 1155, 816, 674, 12, 1963, 4, 87, 71, 1173, 18, 17, 49, 100, 12, 14, 505, 20, 27, 85, 121, 32, 45, 8, 14, 451, 132, 518, 17, 373, 86, 225, 25, 61, 266, 11, 457, 12, 78, 1259, 72, 4187, 6]"
307,8,"Watch out Pixar.Disney Animation Studios is catching up to you.What Frozen lacks in laughs and overall soundtrack value its recovered through a wonderful script, a superb message, and a very likable cast of characters---even if its missing the clichéd Disney villain you love to hate. This movie contains some of the strongest Disney princesses in the history of the studio and also delivers delightful and unexpected twists to the family animation formula.Frozen follows the lives of two siblings to the royal throne that had to be separated after an unfortunate childhood incident. And by the time the rest of society can actually see them they've become two totally different princesses. Following a few complications, Princess Anna heads out into the frozen tundra to try to save her sister Elsa and the kingdom before the sudden wintery conditions become a threat to everyone's well-being.Jennifer Lee's script is the first full screenplay by a woman in Disney animation since Beauty and the Beast. And just like the 1991 masterpiece, Frozen contains strong female characterizations and themes that resonate well with viewers. But complimenting the strong script are some strong visuals and tones that resemble that of your favorite Broadway musicals. Frozen has a Broadway feel that hasn't been felt since The Lion King far back in the Disney Renaissance period. And this is because of excellent detailed animation work, great voice acting that doesn't rely on star power, and great direction by Lee and Chris Buck—an underrated mind that was behind the underrated Tarzan and extremely under-the-radar Surf's Up.Yes, the movie doesn't quite have the humor of Princess and the Frog (and the Disney animated wild card Emperor's New Groove) and lacks your classic Disney villain. But the likable cast of characters makes you immediately forget this, ranging from the not-as-annoying-as-you-may-think snowman Olaf to the charming rugged ice-vendor Kristoff. And even with the coldest character Princess Elsa you can't help but feel sympathy for her---especially after she delivers the show-stopping number (Let it Go) that is rising in the YouTube ranks.Frozen is continuing the encouraging trend of delightful and strong-willed female characters meshed into unique stories within the Disney company—Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph being the other previous examples. And to add to that, with Pixar losing some steam its good to see the original Disney Animation Studio recovering from the dark ages of the early 2000s.Despite the title, the movie's characters, themes, heart, and overall production value will warm the hearts of your kids, and you too.","['watch', 'pixar', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'catch', 'frozen', 'lack', 'laugh', 'overall', 'soundtrack', 'value', 'recover', 'wonderful', 'script', 'superb', 'message', 'likable', 'cast', 'character', 'even', 'miss', 'clich', 'disney', 'villain', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'contains', 'strong', 'disney', 'princess', 'history', 'studio', 'also', 'delivers', 'delightful', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'family', 'animation', 'formula', 'frozen', 'follow', 'life', 'two', 'sibling', 'royal', 'throne', 'separate', 'unfortunate', 'childhood', 'incident', 'time', 'rest', 'society', 'actually', 'see', 'become', 'two', 'totally', 'different', 'princess', 'follow', 'complication', 'princess', 'anna', 'head', 'frozen', 'tundra', 'try', 'save', 'sister', 'elsa', 'kingdom', 'sudden', 'wintery', 'condition', 'become', 'threat', 'everyone', 'well', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'script', 'first', 'full', 'screenplay', 'woman', 'disney', 'animation', 'since', 'beauty', 'beast', 'like', 'masterpiece', 'frozen', 'contains', 'strong', 'female', 'characterization', 'theme', 'resonate', 'well', 'viewer', 'compliment', 'strong', 'script', 'strong', 'visuals', 'tone', 'resemble', 'favorite', 'broadway', 'musical', 'frozen', 'broadway', 'feel', 'felt', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'far', 'back', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'period', 'excellent', 'detailed', 'animation', 'work', 'great', 'voice', 'act', 'rely', 'star', 'power', 'great', 'direction', 'lee', 'chris', 'buck', 'underrated', 'mind', 'behind', 'underrated', 'tarzan', 'extremely', 'radar', 'surf', 'yes', 'movie', 'quite', 'humor', 'princess', 'frog', 'disney', 'animate', 'wild', 'card', 'emperor', 'new', 'groove', 'lack', 'classic', 'disney', 'villain', 'likable', 'cast', 'character', 'make', 'immediately', 'forget', 'range', 'annoy', 'may', 'think', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'charm', 'rugged', 'ice', 'vendor', 'kristoff', 'even', 'coldest', 'character', 'princess', 'elsa', 'help', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'especially', 'delivers', 'show', 'stop', 'number', 'let', 'go', 'rise', 'youtube', 'rank', 'frozen', 'continue', 'encourage', 'trend', 'delightful', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'mesh', 'unique', 'story', 'within', 'disney', 'company', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'previous', 'example', 'add', 'pixar', 'lose', 'steam', 'good', 'see', 'original', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'recover', 'dark', 'age', 'early', 'despite', 'title', 'movie', 'character', 'theme', 'heart', 'overall', 'production', 'value', 'warm', 'heart', 'kid']","[23, 194, 2, 21, 311, 1321, 5, 273, 190, 166, 225, 728, 2480, 215, 395, 904, 185, 402, 227, 8, 28, 271, 274, 2, 104, 6, 333, 1, 1054, 167, 2, 29, 636, 311, 27, 1143, 1459, 894, 129, 72, 21, 534, 5, 378, 79, 42, 409, 870, 952, 786, 1555, 466, 1093, 20, 303, 943, 103, 16, 179, 42, 557, 140, 29, 378, 4490, 29, 7, 317, 5, 87, 111, 15, 4, 77, 1072, 3179, 1100, 179, 2180, 109, 18, 464, 416, 395, 36, 246, 1027, 251, 2, 21, 98, 149, 203, 9, 461, 5, 1054, 167, 237, 1640, 226, 3180, 18, 479, 2044, 167, 395, 167, 267, 627, 2344, 189, 411, 51, 5, 411, 53, 155, 98, 152, 97, 142, 74, 2, 465, 1295, 298, 1488, 21, 107, 25, 86, 112, 1299, 249, 24, 25, 754, 416, 526, 490, 1877, 320, 750, 1877, 975, 423, 3655, 325, 1, 124, 222, 29, 659, 2, 38, 2410, 2081, 2971, 108, 2346, 273, 69, 2, 104, 402, 227, 8, 14, 597, 746, 958, 238, 171, 37, 45, 32, 235, 1371, 33, 67, 28, 2016, 8, 29, 4, 135, 53, 2130, 121, 1143, 78, 284, 184, 30, 13, 880, 1654, 1468, 5, 647, 1657, 1678, 1459, 167, 237, 8, 414, 12, 654, 2, 789, 83, 352, 379, 763, 396, 269, 194, 489, 3467, 17, 16, 230, 2, 21, 311, 2480, 628, 139, 594, 313, 590, 1, 8, 226, 80, 166, 700, 728, 362, 80, 60]"

311,-,"Well, my fellow readers, Disney has still got the touch. After going through bayous, high towers and video games, the folks at Disney Animation goes into the business of a winter wonderland with its new feature film, Frozen, and it excels with flying colors and a touching spirit that reminds one of the past ""Disney Renaissance"" films of the 90's.Based on the fable of the Snow Queen, this story is about two sisters of royalty, pampered Anna (voiced by TV's Kristen Bell from House of Cards and Veronica Mars) and Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel from Broadway's Wicked), who has the power of snow. When they were younger, Anna and Elsa used to play together thanks to Elsa's magic. But, Elsa accidentally used her powers on Anna and her parents decided to hide Elsa from the outside world, protecting her witchcraft. Years pass, and soon Elsa becomes the new queen of Arendalle, after her parents' death from a boat accident. But, soon, when she has an argument with Anna, she mistakenly uses her powers and as a result, turns Arendalle from a spring place to a winter nightmare. Elsa then runs away, seeking isolation from the troubles she caused. Anna decides to find her with a help of mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff of HBO's upcoming show, Looking), his reindeer Sven and a moving and can't stop talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad of Broadway's Book of Mormon).The plot is like Sleeping Beauty meets Edward Scissorhands, because Elsa is like a female version of Edward. They both were hidden from the rest of the world, but the difference is that Elsa has snow magic, while Edward has scissors. Jennifer Lee (who co-directs here with Chris Buck) has written a funny and likable script with a bit of the talking style you often hear nowadays on teen TV shows.The animation is lavishing with stunning special effects and a real storybook-like texture to the characters. My favorite scene in the film was the amazing sequence when Elsa decides to make her own snow palace. My fine complements to the people at Disney Animation for a great effort.Plus, the voice cast fits the characters perfectly. Bell and Menzel, respectively, are a perfect match to bring Anna and Elsa to voice life while Gad makes Olaf one of Disney's funniest sidekicks creations since Mushu (Mulan), Sebastian (The Little Mermaid) and Genie (Aladdin), with a sly and wacky attitude and a Martin Short-like voice.The musical score by Broadway vet Robert Lopez (Avenue Q and Book of Mormon) and his wife Kristen is marvelous. It's filled with some hummable tunes including ""For the First Time in Forever"" and ""Let it Go"" (the latter performed astonishingly perfect by Menzel). This music may last in your head for days, maybe weeks.As I said in the beginning, the spirit of this film contributes to the Disney animated films of the past such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Like these mentioned films, Frozen has the goods of a pure Disney film: a working story, love or hate characters, top-notch animation and a wonderful score.This is a charming and winning Christmas gift for all from ages 3 to 103. Plus, in this ""kiddie film"" wasteland of bathroom jokes and copycat home video material, this is the perfect family film for everyone to see. Heck, even your pet may love it.Hopefully with some big box office returns, it could finally put The Lone Ranger mess out of Disney's misery.Note: Preceding the film is a brand new Mickey Mouse short, Get a Horse, where Mickey accidentally comes out of his black-and-white film, trying to save Minnie from Pegleg Pete, straight into the movie theater, and some mayhem happens. It's delightful and proves that Mickey's still got it after 85 years of entertaining moviegoers all across the world.Rating: Frozen: ***1/2Get a Horse: ***Parent Advisory: Frozen is rated PG for some action and mild rude humor. Despite that rating, it's a perfect find for all ages.","['well', 'fellow', 'reader', 'disney', 'still', 'get', 'touch', 'go', 'bayous', 'high', 'tower', 'video', 'game', 'folk', 'disney',

312,7,"Short and simple review: While watching Disney's ""Frozen"", it reminded me of one of those homemade snow cone machines you buy for kids. It served a purpose, but there was nothing great about the taste, overall you were not better nor worst for trying it. By that I mean that the over-all movie was no different/better than any other Disney release that goes straight to video (Example: The list of Tinkerbell movies, The Aladdin sequels, etc). A few points: *The music*. I have in the past enjoyed the singing in Disney movies, but this one was lacking in the ""I love that song"" category. I felt as if this movie had no central sound, no unique ""ethnic"" theme as previous Disney attempts. Most of the music was a blend of what some would say are generic choir music and modest attempts at copying the past Disney hits.*The Villain*. Again, this is something that draws you in to ""root"" for the champion in a Disney movie. But this movie really had no villain until 3/4ths through the movie, and when the ""true"" villain came to, it was a ""shocker"" only because it didn't make much sense (based on the character's previous actions) and seemed truly forced as a way to ""wrap-up"" the movie in a semi-Disney fashion (I guess you have to see someone fail, right?). Missing much that one would say makes a great animated movie, this movie may have been better served as a straight to DVD/BluRay item. However, the movie does keep the children entertained and there was several comedic points created by the character Olaf.If you are looking to take the children to a matinée, this isn't a bad choice, however most adults will find the story ""basic"" and without the charm of previous Disney movies.Your children may forget this movie in a week or two, and you will as well not long after you leave.","['short', 'simple', 'review', 'watch', 'disney', 'frozen', 'remind', 'one', 'homemade', 'snow', 'cone', 'machine', 'buy', 'kid', 'serve', 'purpose', 'nothing', 'great', 'taste', 'overall', 'well', 'bad', 'try', 'mean', 'movie', 'different', 'well', 'disney', 'release', 'go', 'straight', 'video', 'example', 'list', 'tinkerbell', 'movie', 'aladdin', 'sequel', 'etc', 'point', 'music', 'past', 'enjoy', 'sing', 'disney', 'movie', 'one', 'lack', 'love', 'song', 'category', 'felt', 'movie', 'central', 'sound', 'unique', 'ethnic', 'theme', 'previous', 'disney', 'attempt', 'music', 'blend', 'would', 'say', 'generic', 'choir', 'music', 'modest', 'attempt', 'copying', 'past', 'disney', 'hit', 'villain', 'something', 'draw', 'root', 'champion', 'disney', 'movie', 'movie', 'really', 'villain', 'th', 'movie', 'true', 'villain', 'come', 'shocker', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'base', 'character', 'previous', 'action', 'seem', 'truly', 'force', 'way', 'wrap', 'movie', 'semi', 'disney', 'fashion', 'guess', 'see', 'someone', 'fail', 'right', 'miss', 'much', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'make', 'great', 'animate', 'movie', 'movie', 'may', 'well', 'serve', 'straight', 'dvd', 'bluray', 'item', 'however', 'movie', 'keep', 'child', 'entertain', 'several', 'comedic', 'point', 'create', 'character', 'olaf', 'look', 'take', 'child', 'matin', 'e', 'bad', 'choice', 'however', 'adult', 'find', 'story', 'basic', 'without', 'charm', 'previous', 'disney', 'movie', 'child', 'may', 'forget', 'movie', 'week', 'two', 'well', 'long', 'leave']","[263, 516, 161, 23, 2, 5, 1047, 10, 39, 2456, 948, 60, 1173, 646, 156, 25, 1120, 166, 18, 65, 87, 218, 1, 140, 18, 2, 288, 13, 984, 970, 396, 550, 1, 485, 561, 430, 117, 58, 276, 91, 63, 2, 1, 10, 273, 6, 11, 1693, 155, 1, 1061, 259, 414, 226, 763, 2, 448, 58, 1551, 26, 35, 969, 2048, 58, 3686, 448, 276, 2, 234, 104, 89, 1128, 885, 2, 1, 1, 22, 104, 1210, 1, 62, 104, 40, 4508, 14, 31, 217, 256, 8, 763, 345, 75, 329, 272, 50, 1735, 1, 2746, 2, 974, 388, 16, 304, 1166, 130, 271, 31, 10, 26, 35, 14, 25, 38, 1, 1, 171, 18, 1173, 984, 540, 3637, 3687, 110, 1, 154, 70, 243, 608, 1043, 117, 134, 8, 32, 66, 55, 70, 893, 65, 862, 110, 147, 71, 12, 1088, 137, 235, 763, 2, 1, 70, 171, 746, 1, 1078, 42, 18, 169, 322]"

315,9,"In short, it's a modernized masterpiece as expected from the corporations of old-school Disney. Disney had came short of completely grasping the attentions of their characters for the last two decades or so, but I thought Disney was able to make up for their rather on-going shortcomings with this particular film. Character developments are established through another astounding list of its intriguing and catchy musicals, just like timmon and pumba with hakuna matata in lion king; the lamps and candles with their various musicals in beauty and the beast; and... hopefully you get the catch. The directors also did an astonishing job of portraying emotions: as a ""future-hopeful"" psychologist, I thought one of the main intentions of the director's messages was that the emotion of fear and one's own efforts to literally force herself to hide her feelings for the fear of hurting others can and will only do the exact opposite: hurt those whom she love and ultimately herself. Rather, learning to control one's emotion of fear by learning to replace it with the emotion of ""love"" is perhaps one of the greatest lessons in arguably every individual's life.

316,10,"The questions have been far and wide concerning the highly anticipated ""Frozen."" Is it just an icy version of ""Tangled?"" Does it live up to the hype? Is it the best movie since ""The Lion King?"" Well the answers are in order as so: no, yes, and debatable.""Frozen"" is the story of a young princess named Anna. She has spent most her days in the seclusion of her castle for the sole purpose of keeping her safe from the terrifying secret of her sister, Elsa. Elsa has the power to create snow out of nothing. Once her secret comes out there is no stopping her power. So when Elsa runs away Anna goes off to find her along with some new allies. All in the hope of making things right again.This is a completely different story from ""Tangled"" and it proves this with some very nice twists in the whole fairy-tale scheme of things. And it also does a great job of living up to the incredible amount of hype set for the movie (fantastic songs, great voice-cast, beautiful animation, and great writing). However, the statement that it is the ""best movie since 'The Lion King'"" is a very bold one at that. ""The Lion King"" is a classic film that very few films in general can match in caliber. Though I will say ""Frozen"" is a classic in it's own right.The songs for the movie have a deep sense of nostalgia, going all the way back to the Disney Renaissance Era. There were several numbers where I felt transported back to classic musical numbers such as show-stopping numbers like ""Be Our Guest"" and triumphant, powerful songs like ""Circle of Life."" While watching this movie you will definitely feel the intent for this movie to become a Broadway musical. For those who live in New York, be on the look out because this should be one great time at the theatre.Of course the movie would have fallen flat if was not for the wonderful talent of the leading cast (pretty much the entire cast are Broadway vets, hint anybody?). The wonderful innocence, naivety of Anna was portrayed so well by Kristen Bell. When she spoke there was a sweet charm about her and her singing felt more angelic, light. This was a great contrast with the powerful, belting vocals of Idina Menzel as Elsa. Her role as the conflicted queen was perfect for her (also her background with roles like this in ""Wicked"" made her the perfect choice). She brought a certain maturity to conflict Anna's innocence while giving us show-stopping numbers (""Let It Go"" was probably one of the best songs of the year). Their chemistry was great.The rest of the supporting cast did fantastic jobs as well. Jonathan Groff was great as Kristoff (still angry they didn't let him sing much at all). So was Santino Fontana as Hans, but it was Josh Gad as Olaf out of these three who had the best scene-stealing moments. Even though I loved seeing Anna and Kristoff banter back and forth, I felt myself smile even wider whenever Olaf was on screen. He was charming, funny, and just too adorable to ignore. Though I couldn't help but feel bad for laughing while he sang ""In Summer,"" a song about how he'd be doing what a snowman does during summer (dark humor in a Disney movie, love it).All-in-all, this was a great addition to the Disney movie canon. We got ourselves some original and fantastic songs, tons of memorable characters, a wonderfully written script, and some nice (much-needed) twists on the fairy-tale ideas. Even though it is hard to match up to ""The Lion King"" this is still a great Disney movie that the whole family will enjoy and I will not be surprised if it wins the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.","['question', 'far', 'wide', 'concern', 'highly', 'anticipate', 'frozen', 'icy', 'version', 'tangle', 'live', 'hype', 'best', 'movie', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'well', 'answer', 'order', 'yes', 'debatable', 'frozen', 'story', 'young', 'princess', 'name', 'anna', 'spent', 'day', 'seclusion', 'castle', 'sole', 'purpose', 'keep', 'safe', 'terrify', 'secret', 'sister', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'power', 'create', 'snow', 'nothing', 'secret', 'come', 'stop', 'power', 'elsa', 'run', 'away', 'anna', 'go', 'find', 'along', 'new', 'ally', 'hope', 'make', 'thing', 'right', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'tangle', 'prof', 'nice', 'twist', 'whole', 'fairy', 'tale', 'scheme', 'thing', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'living', 'incredible', 'amount', 'hype', 'set', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'song', 'great', 'voice', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'great', 'write', 'however', 'statement', 'best', 'movie', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'bold', 'one', 'lion', 'king', 'classic', 'film', 'film', 'general', 'match', 'caliber', 'though', 'say', 'frozen', 'classic', 'right', 'song', 'movie', 'deep', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'go', 'way', 'back', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'era', 'several', 'number', 'felt', 'transport', 'back', 'classic', 'musical', 'number', 'show', 'stop', 'number', 'like', 'guest', 'triumphant', 'powerful', 'song', 'like', 'circle', 'life', 'watch', 'movie', 'definitely', 'feel', 'intent', 'movie', 'become', 'broadway', 'musical', 'live', 'new', 'york', 'look', 'one', 'great', 'time', 'theatre', 'course', 'movie', 'would', 'fall', 'flat', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'lead', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'cast', 'broadway', 'vet', 'hint', 'anybody', 'wonderful', 'innocence', 'naivety', 'anna', 'portrayed', 'well', 'kristen', 'bell', 'spoke', 'sweet', 'charm', 'sing', 'felt', 'angelic', 'light', 'great', 'contrast', 'powerful', 'belting', 'vocal', 'idina', 'menzel', 'elsa', 'role', 'conflict', 'queen', 'perfect', 'also', 'background', 'role', 'like', 'wicked', 'make', 'perfect', 'choice', 'brought', 'certain', 'maturity', 'conflict', 'anna', 'innocence', 'give', 'u', 'show', 'stop', 'number', 'let', 'go', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'song', 'year', 'chemistry', 'great', 'rest', 'support', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'job', 'well', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'great', 'kristoff', 'still', 'angry', 'let', 'sing', 'much', 'santino', 'fontana', 'han', 'josh', 'gad', 'olaf', 'three', 'best', 'scene', 'steal', 'moment', 'even', 'though', 'love', 'see', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'banter', 'back', 'forth', 'felt', 'smile', 'even', 'wider', 'whenever', 'olaf', 'screen', 'charm', 'funny', 'adorable', 'ignore', 'though', 'help', 'feel', 'bad', 'laugh', 'sang', 'summer', 'song', 'snowman', 'summer', 'dark', 'humor', 'disney', 'movie', 'love', 'great', 'addition', 'disney', 'movie', 'canon', 'get', 'original', 'fantastic', 'song', 'ton', 'memorable', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'write', 'script', 'nice', 'much', 'need', 'twist', 'fairy', 'tale', 'idea', 'even', 'though', 'hard', 'match', 'lion', 'king', 'still', 'great', 'disney', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy', 'surprised', 'win', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'animate', 'feature']","[824, 142, 1226, 1844, 472, 2075, 5, 453, 435, 83, 224, 406, 34, 1, 98, 152, 97, 18, 1145, 496, 325, 5, 12, 73, 29, 183, 7, 992, 138, 2804, 168, 3006, 646, 154, 1174, 1649, 508, 15, 4, 4, 24, 134, 39, 156, 508, 40, 284, 24, 4, 233, 101, 7, 13, 71, 172, 108, 4512, 384, 14, 43, 130, 291, 140, 12, 83, 909, 192, 129, 127, 219, 114, 1467, 43, 27, 25, 373, 704, 549, 624, 406, 144, 1, 253, 11, 25, 86, 227, 93, 21, 25, 165, 110, 2571, 34, 1, 98, 152, 97, 3100, 10, 152, 97, 69, 3, 3, 623, 553, 4513, 100, 35, 5, 69, 130, 11, 1, 574, 217, 1677, 13, 50, 74, 2, 465, 942, 608, 184, 155, 3692, 74, 69, 51, 184, 78, 284, 184, 9, 2790, 439, 11, 9, 2154, 79, 23, 1, 174, 53, 4514, 1, 179, 411, 51, 224, 108, 4515, 66, 10, 25, 20, 1275, 228, 1, 26, 186, 838, 215, 800, 248, 227, 136, 31, 264, 227, 411, 4503, 1281, 2041, 215, 1694, 3373, 7, 918, 18, 162, 146, 2753, 457, 235, 63, 155, 735, 25, 956, 439, 1949, 821, 141, 116, 4, 371, 552, 49, 175, 27, 617, 371, 9, 678, 14, 175, 862, 599, 563, 3450, 552, 7, 1694, 57, 177, 78, 284, 184, 30, 13, 210, 10, 34, 11, 47, 1005, 25, 303, 740, 227, 253, 373, 18, 455, 377, 25, 67, 68, 2162, 30, 63, 31, 688, 665, 44, 275, 257, 32, 433, 34, 90, 906, 133, 28, 100, 6, 16, 7, 67, 4178, 74, 1761, 155, 914, 28, 3693, 1267, 32, 369, 235, 85, 687, 1079, 100, 135, 53, 65, 190, 1142, 205, 11, 45, 205, 628, 222, 2, 1, 6, 25, 1000, 2, 1, 1541, 19, 230, 253, 11, 1106, 268, 8, 1261, 165, 395, 192, 31, 99, 129, 219, 114, 281, 28, 100, 307, 553, 152, 97, 68, 25, 2, 1, 127, 72, 91, 703, 374, 856, 469, 34, 38, 229]"

324,9,"This Disney effort is a delight from beginning to end. It is the story of a young princess who has a curse: anything she touches turns to ice. She can cause glaciers and formations to form just by the wave of a hand. When her parents die, she decides to completely isolate herself from her sister. They grow older on either side of a castle wall. When the castle is opened for the coronation, the younger sister, Anna becomes infatuated with a young prince and actually becomes engaged the same day. When Anna tells Elsa, she is furious and in the process she lets loose all her wintry power, running into the hills. The entire country is now frozen over and Anna's fiancé is left in charge as she runs after her sister. So much has been written, so I won't retrace the ground already trod. If I could offer a layman's advice, it would be to focus more on the character of Elsa. She is the tormented soul who hides away, trying to deal with guilt and despair. She is certainly not unlike Simba in ""The Lion King"" trying to find some peace, trying to recover from intense guilt. The cast of peripheral characters are incredible. I found the snowman really wonderful as are the rock creatures who role in and take on the form of trolls. The music is wonderful (even though I can't escape some of the songs these days) and the dialogue and timing wonderful.","['disney', 'effort', 'delight', 'begin', 'end', 'story', 'young', 'princess', 'curse', 'anything', 'touch', 'turn', 'ice', 'cause', 'glacier', 'formation', 'form', 'wave', 'hand', 'parent', 'die', 'decides', 'completely', 'isolate', 'sister', 'grow', 'old', 'either', 'side', 'castle', 'wall', 'castle', 'open', 'coronation', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'becomes', 'infatuate', 'young', 'prince', 'actually', 'becomes', 'engage', 'day', 'anna', 'tell', 'elsa', 'furious', 'process', 'let', 'loose', 'wintry', 'power', 'run', 'hill', 'entire', 'country', 'frozen', 'anna', 'fianc', 'left', 'charge', 'run', 'sister', 'much', 'write', 'retrace', 'ground', 'already', 'trod', 'could', 'offer', 'layman', 'advice', 'would', 'focus', 'character', 'elsa', 'torment', 'soul', 'hide', 'away', 'try', 'deal', 'guilt', 'despair', 'certainly', 'unlike', 'simba', 'lion', 'king', 'try', 'find', 'peace', 'try', 'recover', 'intense', 'guilt', 'cast', 'peripheral', 'character', 'incredible', 'found', 'snowman', 'really', 'wonderful', 'rock', 'creature', 'role', 'take', 'form', 'troll', 'music', 'wonderful', 'even', 'though', 'escape', 'song', 'day', 'dialogue', 'timing', 'wonderful']","[2, 575, 1062, 160, 41, 12, 73, 29, 405, 212, 260, 113, 33, 328, 4365, 427, 2256, 323, 118, 368, 996, 291, 1438, 15, 285, 64, 353, 387, 168, 1201, 168, 318, 343, 73, 15, 7, 380, 73, 82, 103, 380, 619, 138, 7, 143, 4, 1097, 30, 937, 1366, 24, 233, 1930, 264, 872, 5, 7, 1331, 330, 807, 233, 15, 31, 165, 1051, 397, 54, 705, 4520, 1369, 26, 261, 8, 4, 3188, 1074, 676, 101, 87, 701, 1899, 2980, 442, 766, 2805, 152, 97, 87, 71, 1976, 87, 2480, 2747, 1899, 227, 8, 549, 231, 45, 22, 215, 834, 1334, 371, 55, 427, 123, 58, 215, 28, 100, 950, 11, 138, 719, 1861, 215]"

The songs however, are all amazing and catchy. For example, Idina Menzel's ""Let it go"" is instantly one of my favorite Disney songs of all time. It's even matching the star quality of the classic Masterpieces. The movie really makes me nostalgic and brings up feelings I haven't felt in many years. You get all warm and joyful, just like you used to when you watched the old classics. It's simply an instant classic, and I'm so glad that Disney does what they know best, classics. I'm not saying that the ""new Disney"" productions is bad, Since I love Wreck-it Ralph for example. But there is something special with these classic-style Disney movies.Also, I just want to pinpoint how awesome little Livvy Stubenrauch's (young Anna) voice acting is, it's beyond admirable! I'd give this movie a 10/10 with an additional golden star, if only it was possible.","['without', 'doubt', 'one', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'best', 'may', 'even', 'consider', 'best', 'ever', 'quality', 'animation', 'splendid', 'song', 'story', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'character', 'fall', 'love', 'instantly', 'movie', 'almost', 'feel', 'like', 'musical', 'recurrent', 'music', 'tell', 'story', 'self', 'song', 'however', 'amaze', 'catchy', 'example', 'idina', 'menzel', 'let', 'go', 'instantly', 'one', 'favorite', 'disney', 'song', 'time', 'even', 'match', 'star', 'quality', 'classic', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'really', 'make', 'nostalgic', 'brings', 'feeling', 'felt', 'many', 'year', 'get', 'warm', 'joyful', 'like', 'use', 'watch', 'old', 'classic', 'simply', 'instant', 'classic', 'glad', 'disney', 'know', 'best', 'classic', 'say', 'new', 'disney', 'production', 'bad', 'since', 'love', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'example', 'something', 'special', 'classic', 'style', 'disney', 'movie', 'also', 'want', 'pinpoint', 'awesome', 'little', 'livvy', 'stubenrauch', 'young', 'anna', 'voice', 'act', 'beyond', 'admirable', 'give', 'movie', 'additional', 'golden', 'star', 'possible']","[137, 681, 10, 2, 21, 311, 34, 1, 47, 34, 171, 28, 421, 34, 81, 283, 21, 2578, 11, 12, 292, 765, 8, 186, 6, 1498, 1, 173, 53, 9, 51, 4165, 58, 143, 12, 429, 11, 110, 96, 266, 396, 141, 116, 30, 13, 1498, 10, 189, 2, 11, 20, 28, 553, 249, 283, 69, 461, 1, 22, 14, 1709, 509, 680, 155, 61, 47, 19, 362, 3698, 9, 158, 23, 64, 69, 341, 982, 69, 818, 2, 56, 34, 69, 35, 108, 2, 700, 65, 98, 6, 352, 379, 396, 89, 316, 69, 355, 2, 1, 27, 59, 4206, 338, 48, 73, 7, 86, 112, 614, 1826, 57, 1, 3699, 796, 249, 673]"
333,5,"(This review is written by a 38 yr old male father of four)OK so first off, this film isn't terrible. My rating of 5 out of 10 stars is not a terrible score, but a strictly average one, which in my opinion, sums up this film. I have seen the IMDb film score, which at the current time is at 8.1 and I have also read some gushing reviews about this film, but personally speaking... I just did not feel it. However, it is at least watchable, and in some parts enjoyable, and so not so bad as to feel the need to walk out of the theatre (which I have done twice in my life so far), but if it wasn't for the sake of my children sat right next to me, I may have at least nodded off in my seat (which I have also done twice in my life so far!) But to give Disney credit, the animated scenery looks magnificent, and parts of the film are visually stunning, but that is the least that we should expect from a power-house like Disney these days. But the storyline for me was also very predictable, which I guess is quite hard to avoid being in the fairytale-business and all, but i still feel that more of an effort could be made to shake these films up a touch, into maybe giving us the odd plot-surprise now and then, to keep things fresh.Not only was the storyline predictable, it was a little dull, and to be honest, I also felt the songs were not up to the usual Disney standard either. Nor did they even have the usual Disney 'feel' to them. It was as if they were trying to slightly emulate the feel of a proper grown-up musical, like Les Mis for example, which may have been done intentionally, to bring something a little different to the mix, and also their thinking may have been influenced with the knowledge of Les Mis's recent success at the box office fresh in their minds at the time of film production. But for me, again, it didn't really work for a children's film. The songs were a little dreary compared to the usual upbeat Disney classics so far, and were very, very forgetful. I do not expect this soundtrack to live long in people's memories of top Disney musicals. Whilst watching this film, i also thought that a slightly older audience may appreciate this film more than the usual demographic, but to my surprise, my 3 year old daughter sat through the whole thing without fidgeting at all, which isn't like her :D She loved it. She laughed quite a bit at the Snowman character too. But I have to say, if it wasn't for the inclusion of this character, I think that my young daughter would not have been as happy to watch the whole film. She did still ask if she could have Elsa's dress straight after the credits had finished though haha! So Disney have indeed kept my daughter entertained for an hour and a half (which felt more like 3 hours to me) as usual, but I do not expect it to take the place of her beloved 'Tangled' which she watches at least twice a week :)No doubt Disney will make a decent fortune from this movie, but I just get the feeling it won't gross the usual amounts. I think most people will go to see this movie because they expect a certain format, and because most of us are Disney fans anyway, of which i class myself in that category too, but in my opinion, I think that this time, Disney have veered a little too much off track, and think would benefit from sticking to the usual winning format, which clearly works, such as films like: Lion King; Little Mermaid; Aladdin etc., as these are the great films which stick in my mind as, not only, memorable musically, but also great 'feel-good' and somewhat funny films. I believe Disney can still shake up the story lines a little to prevent the inevitable predictability, but by also sticking to the winning format, I do not think that Disney can go far wrong, especially where the music is concerned.","['review', 'write', 'yr', 'old', 'male', 'father', 'four', 'ok', 'first', 'film', 'terrible', 'rating', 'star', 'terrible', 'score', 'strictly', 'average', 'one', 'opinion', 'sum', 'film', 'see', 'imdb', 'film', 'score', 'current', 'time', 'also', 'read', 'gush', 'review', 'film', 'personally', 'speak', 'feel', 'however', 'least', 'watchable', 'part', 'enjoyable', 'bad', 'feel', 'need', 'walk', 'theatre', 'twice', 'life', 'far', 'sake', 'child', 'sat', 'right', 'next', 'may', 'least', 'nod', 'seat', 'also', 'twice', 'life', 'far', 'give', 'disney', 'credit', 'animate', 'scenery', 'look', 'magnificent', 'part', 'film', 'visually', 'stun', 'least', 'expect', 'power', 'house', 'like', 'disney', 'day', 'storyline', 'also', 'predictable', 'guess', 'quite', 'hard', 'avoid', 'fairytale', 'business', 'still', 'feel', 'effort', 'could', 'make', 'shake', 'film', 'touch', 'maybe', 'give', 'u', 'odd', 'plot', 'surprise', 'keep', 'thing', 'fresh', 'storyline', 'predictable', 'little', 'dull', 'honest', 'also', 'felt', 'song', 'usual', 'disney', 'standard', 'either', 'even', 'usual', 'disney', 'feel', 'try', 'slightly', 'emulate', 'feel', 'proper', 'grown', 'musical', 'like', 'le', 'mi', 'example', 'may', 'intentionally', 'bring', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'mix', 'also', 'think', 'may', 'influence', 'knowledge', 'le', 'mi', 'recent', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'fresh', 'mind', 'time', 'film', 'production', 'really', 'work', 'child', 'film', 'song', 'little', 'dreary', 'compare', 'usual', 'upbeat', 'disney', 'classic', 'far', 'forgetful', 'expect', 'soundtrack', 'live', 'long', 'people', 'memory', 'top', 'disney', 'musical', 'whilst', 'watch', 'film', 'also', 'thought', 'slightly', 'old', 'audience', 'may', 'appreciate', 'film', 'usual', 'demographic', 'surprise', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'sat', 'whole', 'thing', 'without', 'fidget', 'like', 'love', 'laugh', 'quite', 'bit', 'snowman', 'character', 'say', 'inclusion', 'character', 'think', 'young', 'daughter', 'would', 'happy', 'watch', 'whole', 'film', 'still', 'ask', 'could', 'elsa', 'dress', 'straight', 'credit', 'finish', 'though', 'haha', 'disney', 'indeed', 'kept', 'daughter', 'entertain', 'hour', 'half', 'felt', 'like', 'hour', 'usual', 'expect', 'take', 'place', 'beloved', 'tangle', 'watch', 'least', 'twice', 'week', 'doubt', 'disney', 'make', 'decent', 'fortune', 'movie', 'get', 'feel', 'gross', 'usual', 'amount', 'think', 'people', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'expect', 'certain', 'format', 'u', 'disney', 'fan', 'anyway', 'class', 'category', 'opinion', 'think', 'time', 'disney', 'veer', 'little', 'much', 'track', 'think', 'would', 'benefit', 'stick', 'usual', 'win', 'format', 'clearly', 'work', 'film', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'little', 'mermaid', 'aladdin', 'etc', 'great', 'film', 'stick', 'mind', 'memorable', 'musically', 'also', 'great', 'feel', 'good', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'film', 'believe', 'disney', 'still', 'shake', 'story', 'line', 'little', 'prevent', 'inevitable', 'predictability', 'also', 'stick', 'win', 'format', 'think', 'disney', 'go', 'far', 'wrong', 'especially', 'music', 'concerned']","[161, 165, 2133, 64, 431, 1400, 784, 477, 36, 3, 432, 437, 249, 432, 223, 3062, 921, 10, 258, 1404, 3, 16, 866, 3, 223, 1481, 20, 27, 547, 3094, 161, 3, 520, 641, 53, 110, 250, 2495, 94, 306, 65, 53, 99, 669, 1275, 1227, 79, 142, 1105, 70, 1196, 130, 418, 171, 250, 2713, 966, 27, 1227, 79, 142, 57, 2, 662, 38, 1217, 66, 935, 94, 3, 585, 315, 250, 131, 24, 899, 9, 2, 138, 295, 27, 331, 388, 124, 307, 863, 756, 1523, 68, 53, 575, 54, 14, 2591, 3, 260, 232, 57, 177, 1258, 52, 445, 154, 43, 819, 295, 331, 48, 1026, 742, 27, 155, 11, 562, 2, 633, 353, 28, 562, 2, 53, 87, 774, 53, 2195, 1107, 51, 9, 2066, 2079, 396, 171, 2443, 221, 89, 48, 140, 1119, 27, 37, 171, 1484, 2266, 2066, 2079, 399, 577, 598, 717, 819, 320, 20, 3, 700, 22, 107, 70, 3, 11, 48, 350, 562, 1617, 2, 69, 142, 131, 225, 224, 169, 46, 412, 239, 2, 51, 1130, 23, 3, 27, 92, 774, 64, 159, 171, 699, 3, 562, 1645, 445, 47, 64, 389, 1196, 127, 43, 137, 9, 6, 190, 124, 95, 45, 8, 35, 3551, 8, 37, 73, 389, 26, 301, 23, 127, 3, 68, 581, 54, 4, 907, 984, 662, 855, 100, 1977, 2, 826, 498, 389, 243, 487, 346, 155, 9, 487, 562, 131, 55, 188, 1280, 83, 23, 250, 1227, 1078, 681, 2, 14, 546, 3700, 1, 19, 53, 783, 562, 624, 37, 46, 13, 16, 1, 131, 563, 1778, 177, 2, 176, 497, 1283, 1693, 258, 37, 20, 2, 4530, 48, 31, 932, 37, 26, 1711, 1553, 562, 374, 1778, 690, 107, 3, 9, 152, 97, 48, 422, 485, 430, 25, 3, 1553, 320, 268, 1769, 27, 25, 53, 17, 572, 85, 3, 220, 2, 68, 2591, 12, 213, 48, 1264, 2232, 4531, 27, 1553, 374, 1778, 37, 2, 13, 142, 280, 121, 58, 2200]"

340,7,"Towards the end of John Sayles' dark American classic EIGHT MEN OUT, fat cat baseball owner Charlie Comiskey is terrified of losing his whole championship team because they threw the 1919 World Series. But his slick legal counselor tells him not to worry. ""There will be a reform movement, a movement demanding change in baseball. You must be a part of this movement. In fact, you must appear to be leading it.""What does this have to do with FROZEN?Disney Studies is like Charlie Comiskey. They're confronted with a massive backlash, feminists attacking their ""princess"" movies as tired, stale, reactionary, and politically incorrect. Disney's response is to become a part of this protest movement -- in fact, to appear to be leading it. Hence in FROZEN, you have a princess who does NOT meet Prince Charming. Instead she throws a blizzard-size tantrum and goes off and lives in a frozen castle, and this is represented as a heroic feminist act of empowerment, even though no one actually benefits and she doesn't learn or grow in any discernible way. Meanwhile, the princess' cute kid sister meets a handsome prince and falls in love at first sight -- only her prince turns out to be a rat, a Hitchcock style villain who switches sides at the drop of an icicle. This allows her to hook up with a cute ice-chopper, but it's made very clear that this relationship is a lot less important than her relationship with her older sister, who returns from exile and is saved at the last moment by the little sister's self sacrifice. Which is great, no problem there, except that ""bad"" prince just sort of turns bad out of nowhere. And this happens after we've seen him ruling the kingdom better than either sister ever did. But the feminist fable needs a scapegoat, so Hans has to ""take one for the team"" and be banned for life, just like the innocent Buck Weaver in EIGHT MEN OUT. If all this sounds like a tiresome bad review, or a series of snarky criticisms, I really don't mean it to be. I liked FROZEN; at least, the first forty minutes or so. I thought ""Let It Go"" was a real show- stopping number, a true classic. It's just that the second half of the movie drags, and a lot of the characters are forced to behave in ways that aren't authentic just to maintain the illusion that this is a princess movie you can feel ""good"" about watching. Because the happy ending is (sort of) man-free.Or something.","['towards', 'end', 'john', 'sayles', 'dark', 'american', 'classic', 'eight', 'men', 'fat', 'cat', 'baseball', 'owner', 'charlie', 'comiskey', 'terrify', 'lose', 'whole', 'championship', 'team', 'threw', 'world', 'series', 'slick', 'legal', 'counselor', 'tell', 'worry', 'reform', 'movement', 'movement', 'demand', 'change', 'baseball', 'must', 'part', 'movement', 'fact', 'must', 'appear', 'lead', 'frozen', 'disney', 'study', 'like', 'charlie', 'comiskey', 'confront', 'massive', 'backlash', 'feminist', 'attack', 'princess', 'movie', 'tire', 'stale', 'reactionary', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'disney', 'response', 'become', 'part', 'protest', 'movement', 'fact', 'appear', 'lead', 'hence', 'frozen', 'princess', 'meet', 'prince', 'charm', 'instead', 'throw', 'blizzard', 'size', 'tantrum', 'go', 'life', 'frozen', 'castle', 'represent', 'heroic', 'feminist', 'act', 'empowerment', 'even', 'though', 'one', 'actually', 'benefit', 'learn', 'grow', 'discernible', 'way', 'meanwhile', 'princess', 'cute', 'kid', 'sister', 'meet', 'handsome', 'prince', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'prince', 'turn', 'rat', 'hitchcock', 'style', 'villain', 'switch', 'side', 'drop', 'icicle', 'allows', 'hook', 'cute', 'ice', 'chopper', 'make', 'clear', 'relationship', 'lot', 'less', 'important', 'relationship', 'old', 'sister', 'return', 'exile', 'save', 'last', 'moment', 'little', 'sister', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'great', 'problem', 'except', 'bad', 'prince', 'sort', 'turn', 'bad', 'nowhere', 'happens', 'see', 'ruling', 'kingdom', 'well', 'either', 'sister', 'ever', 'feminist', 'fable', 'need', 'scapegoat', 'han', 'take', 'one', 'team', 'ban', 'life', 'like', 'innocent', 'buck', 'weaver', 'eight', 'men', 'sound', 'like', 'tiresome', 'bad', 'review', 'series', 'snarky', 'criticism', 'really', 'mean', 'like', 'frozen', 'least', 'first', 'forty', 'minute', 'thought', 'let', 'go', 'real', 'show', 'stop', 'number', 'true', 'classic', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'drag', 'lot', 'character', 'force', 'behave', 'way', 'authentic', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'princess', 'movie', 'feel', 'good', 'watch', 'happy', 'end', 'sort', 'man', 'free', 'something']","[538, 41, 1205, 628, 1413, 69, 2809, 459, 3193, 2810, 4538, 3702, 4539, 4540, 1649, 489, 127, 486, 2236, 126, 791, 4201, 4541, 143, 1177, 886, 886, 2736, 209, 4538, 236, 94, 886, 201, 236, 582, 248, 5, 2, 2084, 9, 4539, 4540, 2648, 1219, 3045, 720, 1931, 29, 1, 1086, 4200, 2567, 2, 179, 94, 886, 201, 582, 248, 3194, 5, 29, 244, 82, 235, 208, 744, 1508, 4542, 2811, 13, 79, 5, 168, 1194, 2812, 720, 112, 1917, 28, 100, 10, 103, 1711, 347, 285, 50, 1104, 29, 265, 60, 15, 244, 739, 82, 186, 6, 36, 675, 82, 113, 1055, 2968, 355, 104, 3153, 387, 1207, 2381, 1671, 4543, 265, 33, 14, 871, 153, 84, 321, 289, 153, 64, 15, 385, 1602, 111, 197, 133, 48, 15, 429, 635, 25, 198, 474, 65, 82, 539, 113, 65, 801, 591, 16, 2813, 77, 18, 353, 15, 81, 720, 2802, 99, 44, 55, 10, 486, 4544, 79, 9, 1315, 490, 2809, 459, 259, 9, 2573, 65, 161, 791, 4545, 1091, 22, 218, 9, 5, 250, 36, 3195, 211, 92, 30, 13, 195, 78, 284, 184, 62, 69, 319, 346, 1, 1045, 84, 8, 272, 3703, 50, 2225, 2938, 4546, 29, 1, 53, 17, 23, 301, 41, 539, 145, 593, 89]"

342,7,"Frozen 7/10- Coming in to this movie, I had no clue what to expect since the trailer I saw for the movie did not really give any key plot details. I had hopes for the movie since the directer, Chris Buck, also directed my favorite childhood movie Tarzan. I was pleased with the results. The first part of the movie got me thinking it was gonna be just a regular princess meets prince and they fall in love type movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie did not even focus on any romantic relationship as much as it focused on the relationship between the two princesses Anna and Elsa. Elsa has special powers where she can turn stuff into ice or snow. This movie makes that seem like a good thing at first, but as it wears on we see that Elsa cannot control her powers and now puts everyone around her in danger. She has to be isolated from everyone, including her little sister Elsa. Elsa does not understand why she can never be with her sister. Elsa one day comes out to be inaugurated as queen, but when her emotions get out of control, she puts the kingdom into an eternal winter and then shes flees to the mountains. Anna must go get her so she can get the kingdom out of an eternal winter. The movie gives a lot of very funny laughs that everyone can enjoy. The characters are all refreshingly original, but the way they are presented is probably what makes them all so likable. Now, just like every other animated movie, the characters at some point break out and start singing. Most of the time, this part of the movie I detest, but I found myself enjoying a couple of them. Don't get me wrong, I find that a character singing out of no where with no one else around to be silly, but at least the ones where the situation made sense for it, I enjoyed. The plot though is very cliché and I wish animated movies would at least try to make themselves different from the others. This movie is at least very fun which is more than enough for me. This movie is not as good Tarzan, but in my opinion, it is the best animated movie of the year.Frozen brings joy to nearly everyone in the theater at one point or another and it is no doubt a great family movie.

343,7,"An enjoyable and exciting adventure tale for the whole family, which also includes many terrific musical numbers, Frozen successfully recaptures the magic and thrill of Disney storytelling. By uniquely placing the story in a Scandinavian setting, Disney further adds to the wide variety of films they have designed through the years, while also having the chance to showcase the truly mesmerizing animation techniques. Although the film is visually very impressive and has an extremely memorable soundtrack, with Idina Menzel's Let It Go being particularly captivating, the story itself does come across as one lacking depth and intensity. Despite the well-developed characters, the film is far less complex when compared to other notable Disney pictures, with the twist in the storyline also being somewhat predictable. All in all, however, the humorous aspect of the film and the strength of its music does ultimately prevail, making Frozen a fun and entertaining experience, thus again proving the ever-lasting magic of Disney animation.","['enjoyable', 'excite', 'adventure', 'tale', 'whole', 'family', 'also', 'include', 'many', 'terrific', 'musical', 'number', 'frozen', 'successfully', 'recapture', 'magic', 'thrill', 'disney', 'storytelling', 'uniquely', 'place', 'story', 'scandinavian', 'set', 'disney', 'far', 'add', 'wide', 'variety', 'film', 'design', 'year', 'also', 'chance', 'showcase', 'truly', 'mesmerize', 'animation', 'technique', 'although', 'film', 'visually', 'impressive', 'extremely', 'memorable', 'soundtrack', 'idina', 'menzel', 'let', 'go', 'particularly', 'captivate', 'story', 'come', 'across', 'one', 'lack', 'depth', 'intensity', 'despite', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'film', 'far', 'less', 'complex', 'compare', 'notable', 'disney', 'picture', 'twist', 'storyline', 'also', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'however', 'humorous', 'aspect', 'film', 'strength', 'music', 'ultimately', 'prevail', 'make', 'frozen', 'fun', 'entertain', 'experience', 'thus', 'prove', 'ever', 'last', 'magic', 'disney', 'animation']","[306, 447, 326, 114, 127, 72, 27, 349, 61, 1415, 51, 184, 5, 1509, 2919, 150, 1019, 2, 689, 3597, 188, 12, 1089, 144, 2, 142, 269, 1226, 1519, 3, 424, 47, 27, 632, 2125, 329, 2695, 21, 2340, 255, 3, 585, 933, 423, 268, 225, 141, 116, 30, 13, 536, 1024, 12, 40, 1168, 10, 273, 609, 4547, 313, 18, 610, 8, 3, 142, 321, 771, 350, 1805, 2, 438, 129, 295, 27, 572, 331, 110, 1135, 443, 3, 887, 58, 941, 4548, 14, 5, 125, 243, 334, 1348, 799, 81, 197, 150, 2, 21]"
344,7,"SPOILERI must say that after all the noises made around FROZEN, my expectations were quite high. I took my kids to watch it at the movie on a Saturday morning, it was played 3D so we were all very excited. Unfortunately the movie (at least the story line) did not meet the level of quality I had expected. I thought the movie was going to be about the Snow Queen Elsa, I mean her as the main character. Instead most of the movie is seen through the eyes of her sister Anna, who is funny, charming and all but that's it, that was a let down to me. The beginning was promising but .. Plus to be honest, I did not find the songs particularly nice, (except the very first one sang by the men cutting the ice) Most songs were even annoying at a point, sorry for the fans. I was also disappointed that Elsa did not have a love interest, someone who would discover and appreciate her qualities, her gentleness, and re vive the flame in her lonely heart (this is so not Disney), I honestly thought that Kristof who fulfill this role due to his love for ice and snow etc, but no, he ends up with Anna who has already experienced a romance with prince Hanz ? Poor Elsa. Now the positive point is the animation, the 3-d effects, WAOW that is something. Well done to the crew who worked on that! OVERALL, i give it a 7 for the visual quality of the movie but to me it will not be as memorable as other princess Disney movies.

And because it's a Disney movie.Yes, the graphics are beautiful, but, and I'm sorry for the people who did like it, the characters were horrible. Let's start with Elsa. Such weird character development she has.

She thinks she's funny but she's definitely not. Again, sorry people who do like her.But the worst character of all is Olaf the snowman. Have you seen that guy? His sense of humor is just so terrible. And his song is so ANNOYING. I really wanted to skip it. I really thought he would be a funny character.I'm not going to describe every character, because there were also a few good ones. Like Kristoff. He and his reindeer. Heh, that was quite funny, actually.The story was cliché, but it's sometimes nice to have a cliché.

I would have say Tangled was better than Frozen.Most of the marketing campaign I have seen for Frozen has always featured Elsa on the front which immediately misleads people into believing Elsa is the main protagonist of the film.As I am aware, Elsa was meant to be the villain and the decision to change her was a perfect idea because Elsa stood out and had the looks, the back story, internal problems, magical elements and the aura of the heroine/princess that immediately makes you question why she was not the main character.Anna was the ironically the 'princess' of the film who would have done great in the original scripts, but the redesign of Elsa pretty much dropped Anna down into the side character list who role is to be a supporting character... but yet retains the role as the main protagonist, whilst she had her fair share of problems... I felt Elsa problems were more of a main focus than Anna's... Ironically the actual prince of the film did predictably turn out to be evil... like the moment he declared he was 13th in line and immediately asked Anna to marry him. Come on it was kinda obvious when Elsa has been so redesigned that even her 'villain' act didn't have much effect and you still get that heroine aura.Nonetheless the film was fantastic and was a great hit especially with the let it go song and the scene of when she transform and built the Ice palace... If anything... I would like to see a sequel or a remake with Elsa as the main aim... though I hope that Disney has learned from there mistakes and will produce another great film next time.","['starter', 'actually', 'know', 'frozen', 'saw', 'picture', 'korean', 'cosplayer', 'name', 'tomia', 'cosplays', 'elsa', 'whilst', 'major', 'fan', 'disney', 'princess', 'franchise', 'however', 'knowledgeable', 'style', 'portray', 'princess', 'film', 'really', 'hooked', 'onto', 'disney', 'princess', 'franchise', 'basically', 'tangle', 'modern', 'day', 'reboot', 'classic', 'franchise', 'use', 'music', 'express', 'character', 'drive', 'story', 'along', 'prince', 'help', 'damsel', 'distress', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'since', 'tangle', 'recent', 'notable', 'modern', 'day', 'cgi', 'disney', 'princess', 'film', 'compare', 'frozen', 'would', 'say', 'tangle', 'well', 'frozen', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'see', 'frozen', 'always', 'feature', 'elsa', 'front', 'immediately', 'misleads', 'people', 'believe', 'elsa', 'main', 'protagonist', 'film', 'aware', 'elsa', 'meant', 'villain', 'decision', 'change', 'perfect', 'idea', 'elsa', 'stood', 'look', 'back', 'story', 'internal', 'problem', 'magical', 'element', 'aura', 'heroine', 'princess', 'immediately', 'make', 'question', 'main', 'character', 'anna', 'ironically', 'princess', 'film', 'would', 'great', 'original', 'script', 'redesign', 'elsa', 'pretty', 'much', 'drop', 'anna', 'side', 'character', 'list', 'role', 'support', 'character', 'yet', 'retains', 'role', 'main', 'protagonist', 'whilst', 'fair', 'share', 'problem', 'felt', 'elsa', 'problem', 'main', 'focus', 'anna', 'ironically', 'actual', 'prince', 'film', 'predictably', 'turn', 'evil', 'like', 'moment', 'declare', 'th', 'line', 'immediately', 'ask', 'anna', 'marry', 'come', 'kinda', 'obvious', 'elsa', 'redesign', 'even', 'villain', 'act', 'much', 'effect', 'still', 'get', 'heroine', 'aura', 'nonetheless', 'film', 'fantastic', 'great', 'hit', 'especially', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'scene', 'transform', 'built', 'ice', 'palace', 'anything', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'sequel', 'remake', 'elsa', 'main', 'aim', 'though', 'hope', 'disney', 'learn', 'mistake', 'produce', 'another', 'great', 'film', 'next', 'time']","[4229, 103, 56, 5, 157, 438, 4086, 183, 4, 1130, 823, 176, 2, 29, 1361, 110, 4550, 355, 1018, 29, 3, 22, 2503, 1922, 2, 29, 1361, 570, 83, 324, 138, 4551, 69, 1361, 158, 58, 1099, 8, 1192, 12, 172, 82, 135, 1492, 1563, 224, 795, 81, 98, 83, 399, 1805, 324, 138, 555, 2, 29, 3, 350, 5, 26, 35, 83, 18, 5, 1387, 4552, 16, 5, 163, 229, 4, 938, 597, 46, 220, 4, 119, 354, 3, 1627, 4, 868, 104, 758, 209, 175, 281, 4, 1485, 66, 74, 12, 1517, 198, 170, 401, 3705, 565, 29, 597, 14, 824, 119, 8, 7, 2268, 29, 3, 26, 25, 230, 395, 4553, 4, 136, 31, 1207, 7, 387, 8, 550, 371, 740, 8, 182, 4248, 371, 119, 354, 1130, 1257, 781, 198, 155, 4, 198, 119, 261, 7, 2268, 815, 82, 3, 113, 277, 9, 133, 2741, 1210, 213, 597, 581, 7, 390, 40, 629, 595, 4, 4553, 28, 104, 112, 31, 278, 68, 19, 565, 3705, 1792, 3, 253, 25, 234, 121, 30, 13, 11, 90, 2004, 787, 33, 383, 212, 26, 9, 16, 561, 3196, 4, 119, 859, 100, 384, 2, 347, 967, 587, 102, 25, 3, 418, 20]"
347,8,"Is it wrong to have walked into Frozen with such high expectations? Just a week after writing a lengthy blog about how one of the defining meanings behind my consistently gray wardrobe is to represent neutrality before entering a film even with numerous forces that allow for judgment and opinion-forming to occur I entered Frozen with a very high bar in place that I was hoping it would live up to.This is where my recognition for separate forces intruding on ones open-minded approach to a film comes in. Frozen has been in wide release in America since November 2013, is one of only eighteen films to gross $1 billion - one of the five to be an original product and unrelated to a preexisting franchise - has made prominence by its effervescent soundtrack, has been ubiquitous in many toy-store aisles, and is currently topping the favorite film list by the same young girls who can't even keep count of how many times they've seen it thus far.Based on that astounding resume, even with the high standards and the factor of the animation bar being raised within the last decade or so, I think having higher expectations for Frozen isn't such a wrongheaded thing. The only issue is that when a film is positioned in this high of a light over time, and one hasn't the film until much later in its run, it sets up a bigger opportunity to disappoint than it does to impress thanks to unintentionally higher expectations based on exposure and praise.Let's cut to the chase, though - I found myself really enjoying Frozen overall, admiring the remarkable beauty in its visuals, the memorable songs sung throughout the film, the eccentric and, for the most part, lovable characters, and the warm feel it provided consistently reminiscent of the Disney princess films of yesteryear. To put it simply, this is Beauty and the Beast/The Lion King level quality for the new generation.Without spending too much time on the story, the film centers around Elsa, the Princess of Arendelle, who has the magical power to create snow and ice from thin air, and Anna, her younger sister. Anna and Elsa have held something of a cold (no pun intended) relationship since childhood, growing more and more distant and shunning one another after an accident induced by playing when they were young kids. Yet now that she's older, Elsa has caused a yearlong winter, much to the dismay of Anna, who takes it upon herself to travel to her older sister's coronation and break her infinite cold spell as well as mend their relationship.Along the way, Anna meets the likes of Kristoff, an avid climber whose only real friend is Sven, a loyal moose, as well as meeting Olaf, an eccentric and cheery snowman who wishes to experience the wondrous qualities of summertime. While embarking on this dangerous but worthwhile quest, Anna contemplates whether or not to marry Hans, the Prince of Southern Isles, who she feels she has fallen in true love with after only meeting him for a short amount of time.Instantaneously, the standout of Frozen its high-spirited soundtrack, right down to Idina Menzel's Oscar-winning song ""Let it Go."" In a world where so many animated films bear tired songs that are drab and more often than not forgettable, Frozen incorporates very memorable songs sung by its variety of characters, with my personal favorites being ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?,"" ""Love is an Open Door,"" and ""Reindeers are Better than People."" On top of that, Frozen also includes a lively and highly-detailed visual scheme to match its premise, with what appear to be animated acres of pearly white snow decorating the trees and the ground, with the texture of ice and buildings looking consistently sublime. This is a rare Disney film that makes you invested in its world where some just keep you at arm's length as a passive observer. Frozen does what few films do and that's offer you to come play in the snow with everyone.If Disney has proved anything with Frozen and Wreck-It Ralph and Dreamworks with Despicable Me and How to Train Your Dragon it's that Pixar is not the only animation studio with the power to create a story that will appeal to children as well as adults. Pixar has been criticized recently for being in something of a slump since their recent string of animated films has not been as impressive as their streak had been for several years prior. If anything, these films from two enormous companies is a wakeup call to Pixar basically iterating the idea that they have rough and tumble competition, whether they'd like to admit it or not.On a final note, is there some disappointment I experienced with Frozen? Maybe a little bit; I'm growing incredibly weary of princess films for one and thought maybe this would've worked better as a story about two ordinary siblings rather than draping them in princess and attire, and I occasionally found Olaf to be an annoying, overly-quirky little side character. However, above all, I see Frozen being as cheerfully regarded by the new generation as The Lion King is for my generation.Voiced by: Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, and Santino Fontana.

348,8,"I realize that I am way late for this bandwagon. However, I just recently saw this with family, so I might as well make a review considering how big it is. The movie is about a princess who discovers that her sister has special ice controlling powers. Afraid of all the harm she caused and will cause, she runs away. The princess, who I believe is named Anna, must go and find her and help restore peace to the world and even there selves. And after this movie ended, I completely understood all the hype. I found this premise to be fantastic. Disney has always done a great job of making princess stories interesting and this is no exception. What makes this story even cooler is the magic part. It brings some well needed conflict to the table and helps the movie really succeed in what its showing. The voice acting in this movie was great. Everyone played the part that they needed to play. There was no wink link in any of the acting. And the singing was great. Everyone that sang had a great voice and suited their songs well. The best song was obviously Let it Go. I mean, honestly. Everyone loves that song. I also thought the characters were great. They were entertaining and, at the same time, relatable. They brought lots of charm to the table. My favorite character? Olaf. Obviously. I also like the chemistry between the characters. They worked will with each other, which made the movie all the more pleasant. This movie is funny, yes. There are quite a few witty moments that will have you chuckling, or in some cases, laughing out loud. However, the parts that stole the show were the scenes with the most heart. They were full of emotion and managed to tug on my heart strings. Hard. Finally, the animation is absolutely beautiful. Normally, animation in Disney movies look pretty good, but this movie just looks fantastic. Especially the scenes where there's ice forming everywhere. Those scenes are awesome! Despite all of these many good things, I have a couple negatives. First is that this movie feels unbalanced with songs. The beginning of the movie is jam packed with songs. There are so many song moments at the beginning of the movie that there are very few near the middle and none at the end. I feel like if they spread out the songs some, it would feel like every part would get an equal opportunity of music. I also was not a huge fan of the very beginning. I thought it was a little cheesy. Not the entire beginning, though. Really just up until the princesses become adults. I didn't think the very beginning was bad. I just thought it was a little over the top. This next point is not really a negative; it's more of a wish. I kind of wanted to see more of the ice princess's point of view. As much as I liked the true main character, I wanted to see more of the ice queen. I wanted to see more of her coping with these powers and struggling with the life she has. It's a minor complaint, but it's something I wish happened. Overall, this was a great movie. It had everything that makes a Disney movie really shine. I completely understand all the press it's been getting. It was in the top five at the box office for 3 months, and there's good reason why. If you haven't seen it yet, you should. It's a great animated movie for the whole family.","['realize', 'way', 'late', 'bandwagon', 'however', 'recently', 'saw', 'family', 'might', 'well', 'make', 'review', 'consider', 'big', 'movie', 'princess', 'discovers', 'sister', 'special', 'ice', 'control', 'power', 'afraid', 'harm', 'cause', 'cause', 'run', 'away', 'princess', 'believe', 'name', 'anna', 'must', 'go', 'find', 'help', 'restore', 'peace', 'world', 'even', 'self', 'movie', 'end', 'completely', 'understood', 'hype', 'found', 'premise', 'fantastic', 'disney', 'always', 'great', 'job', 'make', 'princess', 'story', 'interest', 'exception', 'make', 'story', 'even', 'cooler', 'magic', 'part', 'brings', 'well', 'need', 'conflict', 'table', 'help', 'movie', 'really', 'succeed', 'show', 'voice', 'act', 'movie', 'great', 'everyone', 'played', 'part', 'need', 'play', 'wink', 'link', 'act', 'sing', 'great', 'everyone', 'sang', 'great', 'voice', 'suit', 'song', 'well', 'best', 'song', 'obviously', 'let', 'go', 'mean', 'honestly', 'everyone', 'love', 'song', 'also', 'thought', 'character', 'great', 'entertain', 'time', 'relatable', 'brought', 'lot', 'charm', 'table', 'favorite', 'character', 'olaf', 'obviously', 'also', 'like', 'chemistry', 'character', 'work', 'make', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'funny', 'yes', 'quite', 'witty', 'moment', 'chuckle', 'case', 'laugh', 'loud', 'however', 'part', 'stole', 'show', 'scene', 'heart', 'full', 'emotion', 'manage', 'tug', 'heart', 'string', 'hard', 'finally', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'normally', 'animation', 'disney', 'movie', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'look', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'scene', 'ice', 'form', 'everywhere', 'scene', 'awesome', 'despite', 'many', 'good', 'thing', 'couple', 'negative', 'first', 'movie', 'feel', 'unbalanced', 'song', 'begin', 'movie', 'jam', 'packed', 'song', 'many', 'song', 'moment', 'begin', 'movie', 'near', 'middle', 'none', 'end', 'feel', 'like', 'spread', 'song', 'would', 'feel', 'like', 'every', 'part', 'would', 'get', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'music', 'also', 'huge', 'fan', 'begin', 'thought', 'little', 'cheesy', 'entire', 'begin', 'though', 'really', 'princess', 'become', 'adult', 'think', 'begin', 'bad', 'thought', 'little', 'top', 'next', 'point', 'really', 'negative', 'wish', 'kind', 'want', 'see', 'ice', 'princess', 'point', 'view', 'much', 'like', 'true', 'main', 'character', 'want', 'see', 'ice', 'queen', 'want', 'see', 'cop', 'power', 'struggle', 'life', 'minor', 'complaint', 'something', 'wish', 'happen', 'overall', 'great', 'movie', 'everything', 'make', 'disney', 'movie', 'really', 'shine', 'completely', 'understand', 'press', 'get', 'top', 'five', 'box', 'office', 'month', 'good', 'reason', 'see', 'yet', 'great', 'animate', 'movie', 'whole', 'family']","[428, 50, 530, 2816, 110, 1253, 157, 72, 252, 18, 14, 161, 421, 106, 1, 29, 1859, 15, 316, 33, 128, 24, 558, 709, 328, 328, 233, 101, 29, 220, 183, 7, 236, 13, 71, 135, 1934, 1976, 126, 28, 429, 1, 41, 291, 2167, 406, 231, 1222, 253, 2, 163, 25, 373, 14, 29, 12, 122, 645, 14, 12, 28, 4562, 150, 94, 509, 18, 99, 552, 1461, 135, 1, 22, 1101, 78, 86, 112, 1, 25, 109, 507, 94, 99, 204, 2238, 112, 63, 25, 109, 1142, 25, 86, 1355, 11, 18, 34, 11, 613, 30, 13, 218, 542, 109, 6, 11, 27, 92, 8, 25, 243, 20, 884, 599, 84, 235, 1461, 189, 8, 32, 613, 27, 9, 1005, 8, 107, 14, 1, 978, 1, 85, 325, 124, 1216, 133, 2074, 514, 190, 798, 110, 94, 2217, 78, 90, 80, 246, 240, 857, 3715, 80, 2505, 307, 241, 21, 292, 93, 1297, 21, 2, 1, 66, 136, 17, 1, 66, 253, 121, 90, 33, 427, 879, 90, 338, 313, 61, 17, 43, 398, 761, 36, 1, 53, 3389, 11, 160, 1, 4435, 1184, 11, 61, 11, 133, 160, 1, 449, 962, 679, 41, 53, 9, 2367, 11, 26, 53, 9, 115, 94, 26, 19, 1718, 759, 58, 27, 360, 176, 160, 92, 48, 922, 264, 160, 100, 22, 29, 179, 147, 37, 160, 65, 92, 48, 239, 418, 117, 22, 761, 417, 193, 59, 16, 33, 29, 117, 413, 31, 9, 62, 119, 8, 59, 16, 33, 49, 59, 16, 4563, 24, 639, 79, 670, 897, 89, 417, 290, 166, 25, 1, 132, 14, 2, 1, 22, 1594, 291, 216, 2628, 19, 239, 731, 598, 717, 860, 17, 180, 16, 182, 25, 38, 1, 127, 72]"

350,8,"It's easy to get caught up in the toying with classic Disney tropes and strong female characters, but before I talk about that, I just want to point out that this is an incredibly entertaining movie. The animation is terrific (such as the creation of the ice castle), the characters are interesting, and the movie does a good job of balancing some very serious themes with some really funny moments, particularly those involving a hilarious snowman.Having said that, the most striking thing about the movie is the way in which its creators purposely play with classic Snow-White concepts like True Love and Prince Charming, and even play with lesser animated stock concepts like talking animals (one human likes to give voice to his pet).For decades, Disney essentially gold little girls to be nice and sweet and complacent and eventually a nice man would come and save them from the evil in their lives (often represented by strong women).As society has changed, Disney has been making their women stronger. Frozen does that as well, but it does so in a more in-your-face way, not just making a stronger princess but essentially mocking classic plot points of earlier movies.Frozen's messages of empowerment, sisterly love, and being true to yourself aren't necessarily radical, yet in the context of Disney they feel a little radical.The movie contains two princesses; Anna, who is tough and adventurous and wakes up looking very unprincessy, and Elsa, whose fear of her powers gives way in the anthemic Let It Go, a song I thought was catchy on its on but that in the context of the movie is exhilarating.In terms of emotional resonance and subverting tropes, Frozen is perfect, but the story has some practical issues. Most notably, the film's concept of how government works in a kingdom makes no sense, starting with the moment when a visiting diplomat orders the towns guards to grab the queen, which I cannot see happening. There are a number of places, all involving governance, where the movie just makes no sense at all. Of course, Disney films are never realistic, but you've got to draw a line of sense somewhere.I'm torn between giving this movie an 8 and a 9. It's very good, and I left the film with a feeling of elation that made me think it deserved a 9. But if I think about it rationally, beyond my admiration for its feminist message, taking into account plot weaknesses, I'm inclined to give it an 8.But 8 or 9, it should be seen. It's a lot of fun.","['easy', 'get', 'caught', 'toy', 'classic', 'disney', 'trope', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'talk', 'want', 'point', 'incredibly', 'entertain', 'movie', 'animation', 'terrific', 'creation', 'ice', 'castle', 'character', 'interest', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'balance', 'serious', 'theme', 'really', 'funny', 'moment', 'particularly', 'involve', 'hilarious', 'snowman', 'say', 'strike', 'thing', 'movie', 'way', 'creator', 'purposely', 'play', 'classic', 'snow', 'white', 'concept', 'like', 'true', 'love', 'prince', 'charm', 'even', 'play', 'lesser', 'animate', 'stock', 'concept', 'like', 'talk', 'animal', 'one', 'human', 'like', 'give', 'voice', 'pet', 'decade', 'disney', 'essentially', 'gold', 'little', 'girl', 'nice', 'sweet', 'complacent', 'eventually', 'nice', 'man', 'would', 'come', 'save', 'evil', 'life', 'often', 'represent', 'strong', 'woman', 'society', 'change', 'disney', 'make', 'woman', 'strong', 'frozen', 'well', 'face', 'way', 'make', 'strong', 'princess', 'essentially', 'mock', 'classic', 'plot', 'point', 'earlier', 'movie', 'frozen', 'message', 'empowerment', 'sisterly', 'love', 'true', 'necessarily', 'radical', 'yet', 'context', 'disney', 'feel', 'little', 'radical', 'movie', 'contains', 'two', 'princess', 'anna', 'tough', 'adventurous', 'wake', 'look', 'unprincessy', 'elsa', 'whose', 'fear', 'power', 'give', 'way', 'anthemic', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'thought', 'catchy', 'context', 'movie', 'exhilarate', 'term', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'subvert', 'trope', 'frozen', 'perfect', 'story', 'practical', 'issue', 'notably', 'film', 'concept', 'government', 'work', 'kingdom', 'make', 'sense', 'start', 'moment', 'visit', 'diplomat', 'order', 'town', 'guard', 'grab', 'queen', 'see', 'happen', 'number', 'place', 'involve', 'governance', 'movie', 'make', 'sense', 'course', 'disney', 'film', 'never', 'realistic', 'get', 'draw', 'line', 'sense', 'somewhere', 'torn', 'give', 'movie', 'good', 'left', 'film', 'feel', 'elation', 'make', 'think', 'deserve', 'think', 'rationally', 'beyond', 'admiration', 'feminist', 'message', 'take', 'account', 'plot', 'weakness', 'inclined', 'give', 'see', 'lot', 'fun']","[454, 19, 1707, 463, 69, 2, 1032, 167, 237, 8, 178, 59, 117, 603, 243, 1, 21, 1415, 1075, 33, 168, 8, 122, 1, 17, 373, 677, 835, 226, 22, 85, 133, 536, 584, 364, 45, 35, 1193, 43, 1, 50, 1053, 4564, 204, 69, 39, 365, 693, 9, 62, 6, 82, 235, 28, 204, 4092, 38, 1975, 693, 9, 178, 876, 10, 515, 9, 57, 86, 983, 492, 2, 1668, 1920, 48, 76, 192, 457, 652, 192, 145, 26, 40, 111, 277, 79, 583, 1194, 167, 251, 943, 209, 2, 14, 251, 167, 5, 18, 381, 50, 14, 167, 29, 1668, 2817, 69, 52, 117, 846, 1, 5, 185, 1917, 711, 6, 62, 1284, 2818, 182, 1470, 2, 53, 48, 2818, 1, 1054, 42, 29, 7, 1771, 1710, 1238, 66, 4, 620, 187, 24, 57, 50, 4565, 30, 13, 11, 92, 266, 1470, 1, 3717, 657, 342, 4566, 2507, 1032, 5, 175, 12, 519, 2323, 3, 693, 2598, 107, 77, 14, 217, 120, 133, 1341, 3718, 496, 602, 1708, 1854, 49, 16, 290, 184, 188, 584, 1, 14, 217, 228, 2, 3, 88, 640, 19, 1128, 213, 217, 1867, 3719, 57, 1, 17, 330, 3, 53, 14, 37, 483, 37, 4567, 614, 720, 185, 55, 1732, 52, 2819, 2609, 57, 16, 84, 125]"

353,9,"This has been one of the most talked about movies in a long time. Are Disney's new princesses feminists? Are there LGBT undertones? Is there a gay family in it? Are the princesses ""strong women""? Let's just look at this loose adaption of Hans Christian Ansderson's ""The Snow Queen"".Elsa and Anna are princesses living in the fictional kingdom of Arrendelle. Elsa is endowed with mysterious powers that allow her to shoot ice and snow from her hands. When she accidentally injures her younger sister Anna with her powers their parents force her to hide and keep herself hidden from Anna and the world. Shortly after their parents die when the girls are teenagers, Elsa has a coronation ceremony. At the party, Anna instantly falls in love with a handsome prince named Hans, and announces to Elsa that she is engaged. This makes Elsa fly into a rage that releases her frosty powers, terrifies the kingdom, and sends Arrendelle into an intense winter during summer. She escapes to the mountains, and Anna rushes after her sister, who she is sure didn't mean to hurt anyone. Anna is aided by a quirky woodsman named Kristoffe, his dog-like reindeer Sven, and a hilarious, living snowman Olaf. Together, they all try to help Elsa, stop the winter, and return Arrendelle to the kingdom it once was.This movie is good. It's cute, it's funny, it has good songs, the animation is done well, and it is entertaining for children and adults alike. ""Let It Go"" is one of the best Disney songs I've heard in many years, and Olaf the snowman is the funniest animated character I've seen in ANY animated film in a long time. I am so entirely tired of people obsessing about the feminist and possibly gay undertones/implications of the film, instead of the actual film itself. Point blank, there is nothing damaging about the plot or messages in this film, obviously or subtly. It's not a groundbreaking film, but it's not any step back either. Without giving it away, I will say I was impressed with a plot twist or two towards the end that I really did not expect. That twist itself impressed me not because it was ""progressive"", but because it wasn't something I expected from average, predictable Disney films. Its real focus is love, and they do a good job. Like Brave as well, it's focusing more on relationships and love between two female characters rather than a male and female or two males. The only real criticism I have about this film is that, although the animation is good, it is computerized and...has less variety than traditional animation.

354,9,"There's a new snowman in town!I'm a little bit out of touch with kids movie, so I was a late on the bandwagon with this one. I probably wouldn't have even gone to watch it in theatres (in 3D, nonetheless) had I not read an article about how groundbreaking this film was through its exploration of modern themes that aren't found in typical Disney princess movies. The most obvious is theme is the peril in hasty decisions. Elsa's younger sister, Anna, meets a prince and is quick to marry him. We can't really blame her for rash decisions, since both of the sisters live in isolation for such a long time. Yet unlike other Disney classics (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella), the princess is actually encouraged NOT to wed the man she just met. I won't say much else about that other than decisions based on haste don't usually do much good. Even the respect that Elsa initially has on becoming a single queen with no husband is a little unusual. It's a subtle testament to female empowerment. Subtle, but powerful.Besides the more atypical themes, there are the usual things that we expect out of every Disney movie. Happiness, love and cuteness.And let's not forget Olaf, the most adorable snowman I have ever met. Favourite character, definitely tops Frosty.","['new', 'snowman', 'town', 'little', 'bit', 'touch', 'kid', 'movie', 'late', 'bandwagon', 'one', 'probably', 'even', 'go', 'watch', 'theatre', 'nonetheless', 'read', 'article', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'exploration', 'modern', 'theme', 'found', 'typical', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'obvious', 'theme', 'peril', 'hasty', 'decision', 'elsa', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'meet', 'prince', 'quick', 'marry', 'really', 'blame', 'rash', 'decision', 'since', 'sister', 'live', 'isolation', 'long', 'time', 'yet', 'unlike', 'disney', 'classic', 'snow', 'white', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'cinderella', 'princess', 'actually', 'encourage', 'wed', 'man', 'met', 'say', 'much', 'else', 'decision', 'base', 'haste', 'usually', 'much', 'good', 'even', 'respect', 'elsa', 'initially', 'become', 'single', 'queen', 'husband', 'little', 'unusual', 'subtle', 'testament', 'female', 'empowerment', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'besides', 'atypical', 'theme', 'usual', 'thing', 'expect', 'every', 'disney', 'movie', 'happiness', 'love', 'cuteness', 'let', 'forget', 'olaf', 'adorable', 'snowman', 'ever', 'met', 'favourite', 'character', 'definitely', 'top', 'frosty']","[108, 45, 602, 48, 95, 260, 60, 1, 530, 2816, 10, 210, 28, 13, 23, 1275, 1792, 547, 1546, 3, 3724, 324, 226, 231, 376, 2, 29, 1, 595, 226, 3200, 758, 4, 73, 15, 7, 244, 82, 1191, 390, 22, 1631, 4571, 758, 98, 15, 224, 600, 169, 20, 182, 766, 2, 69, 39, 365, 1090, 149, 854, 29, 103, 1657, 2822, 145, 392, 35, 31, 270, 758, 256, 4572, 460, 31, 17, 28, 1311, 4, 2026, 179, 741, 49, 1749, 48, 2419, 1302, 3535, 237, 1917, 1302, 439, 877, 4573, 226, 562, 43, 131, 115, 2, 1, 1501, 6, 1746, 30, 746, 32, 687, 45, 81, 392, 622, 8, 174, 239, 1988]"

But by god, when I saw the film, I was immediately blown away. Everything about the movies was just stunning. The animation, the visuals, the songs, the characters, the story, the risk that it took, it was indescribable. I'm not going to explain the whole plot of this movie because I'll be spoiling it for you and will be doing it injustice so just go watch it yourself to find out how good it is. Though I will admit that I thought the ending was a little bit corny and was done many times before, though they added a little twist to it which was nice to see. Probably the most interesting thing about this movie though is the fact that it addressed a lot of clichés and flaws that other movies have. The movies are about princesses, but they're not your typical damsel in distress that needs saving all the time. n fact, they're pretty strong willed and is willing to take action to make things right rather then waiting for a ""knight in shining armor"" to do it for them, and I respect that. I also thought it was funny how the movie encourages you to NOT fall in love with someone you just met instead of doing the complete opposite like most romantic movies do.

356,9,"Frozen is quite simply an unforgettable movie experience that in my view is to be enjoyed by people of all ages. Adapted from the tale by Hans Christian Andersen, Frozen is a story of young princess, named Elsa who inexplicably has the power to create ice. When she accidentally hurts her younger sister, Anna, she is instructed by her parents to conceal these powers. After her parents tragic death, she loses all control on her coronation day and leaves her kingdom trapped in a eternal winter. From then on Anna sets out on a journey to search for her sister and bring summer back. Anna is a very likable lead character as she is very energetic and brings the spirit of youth that the movie lives off. Kristoff is a great romantic interest for Anna and you sense it growing as the movie progresses. As for the comedy, Olaf and Sven are quite funny and bring the lightest moments in the film.Not since The Lion King have the songs from a Disney movie stuck to my head as much as this one. I'm still hearing ""For The First Time In Forever"" and ""Let It Go"" in my head. Overall fantastic job in the musical department.

If this doesn't show that Disney's in a 2nd Renaissance, I don't know what will. However, there are some issues I have with this movie. One is a ""twist"" at the end of the movie that I'm not a big fan of, but I won't spoil what it is. Also, there's a group of trolls who serve little to no purpose other than singing a silly ""comedic"" song number. Speaking of the songs, that's one thing almost everyone has been praising about this movie. And they're all very good, for the most part. I think they're all enjoyable, it's just that with the exception of a song Elsa sings at one point called ""Let It Go"", none of the songs really struck me as something that I'd sing in my head every now and again. I know music's all subjective so I'll let you decide if the songs are good or not.If I can praise the movie for one thing, it's the character of Elsa. I won't say too much, because of spoilers, but I really liked how they handled her character. The story of her character alone is worth the price of admission, in my opinion. If I could talk about all the other characters, there's also Anna, who's one of Disney's better female protagonists, and she gets nice development as a character. There's also Kristoff who's very likable in his own right. If you're thinking he might just be a clone of Flynn from Tangled, don't worry, he's not. Speaking of being worried, if you're thinking Olaf is going to be annoying, he's not. He's actually really funny, and every other line out of him will leave people in stitches.And of course, since this is a Disney movie, I don't even need to say that the animation is fantastic. Though, while it's animation is great, I like last year's Disney movie, Wreck-It Ralph, from an animation standpoint more. Wreck-It Ralph just did a really good job of combining multiple styles of animation together, and animating all the game characters in the background must have taken quite a while. But still, Frozen, from an animation standpoint is fantastic.Overall, Frozen is another great addition to the Disney movie line-up, and now one of my new personal favorites. Great animation, great and memorable characters, good story, it's just a really good movie. I give it around a 9.3/10, and a high recommendation.","['prophecy', 'trap', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'anna', 'must', 'team', 'kristoff', 'dare', 'mountain', 'man', 'grandest', 'journey', 'find', 'snow', 'queen', 'happens', 'sister', 'elsa', 'put', 'end', 'icy', 'spell', 'encounter', 'everest', 'like', 'extreme', 'mystical', 'creature', 'magic', 'every', 'turn', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'battle', 'element', 'race', 'save', 'kingdom', 'destruction', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'show', 'disney', 'nd', 'renaissance', 'know', 'however', 'issue', 'movie', 'one', 'twist', 'end', 'movie', 'big', 'fan', 'spoil', 'also', 'group', 'troll', 'serve', 'little', 'purpose', 'sing', 'silly', 'comedic', 'song', 'number', 'speak', 'song', 'one', 'thing', 'almost', 'everyone', 'praise', 'movie', 'good', 'part', 'think', 'enjoyable', 'exception', 'song', 'elsa', 'sings', 'one', 'point', 'call', 'let', 'go', 'none', 'song', 'really', 'struck', 'something', 'sing', 'head', 'every', 'know', 'music', 'subjective', 'let', 'decide', 'song', 'good', 'praise', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'character', 'elsa', 'say', 'much', 'spoiler', 'really', 'like', 'handle', 'character', 'story', 'character', 'alone', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'opinion', 'could', 'talk', 'character', 'also', 'anna', 'one', 'disney', 'well', 'female', 'protagonist', 'get', 'nice', 'development', 'character', 'also', 'kristoff', 'likable', 'right', 'think', 'might', 'clone', 'flynn', 'tangle', 'worry', 'speak', 'worried', 'think', 'olaf', 'go', 'annoy', 'actually', 'really', 'funny', 'every', 'line', 'leave', 'people', 'stitch', 'course', 'since', 'disney', 'movie', 'even', 'need', 'say', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'though', 'animation', 'great', 'like', 'last', 'year', 'disney', 'movie', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'animation', 'standpoint', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'combine', 'multiple', 'style', 'animation', 'together', 'animate', 'game', 'character', 'background', 'must', 'take', 'quite', 'still', 'frozen', 'animation', 'standpoint', 'fantastic', 'overall', 'frozen', 'another', 'great', 'addition', 'disney', 'movie', 'line', 'one', 'new', 'personal', 'favorite', 'great', 'animation', 'great', 'memorable', 'character', 'good', 'story', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'give', 'around', 'high', 'recommendation']","[3727, 900, 77, 310, 105, 7, 236, 486, 67, 1110, 214, 145, 337, 71, 39, 49, 591, 15, 4, 196, 41, 453, 858, 951, 2020, 9, 2025, 1542, 1334, 150, 115, 113, 7, 67, 1435, 401, 1224, 111, 77, 3156, 22, 22, 17, 1, 78, 2, 1897, 465, 56, 110, 519, 1, 10, 129, 41, 1, 106, 176, 1056, 27, 849, 123, 1173, 48, 646, 63, 847, 1043, 11, 184, 641, 11, 10, 43, 173, 109, 535, 1, 17, 94, 37, 306, 645, 11, 4, 794, 10, 117, 308, 30, 13, 679, 11, 22, 1367, 89, 63, 317, 115, 56, 58, 3611, 30, 491, 11, 17, 535, 1, 10, 43, 8, 4, 35, 31, 419, 22, 9, 1036, 8, 12, 8, 344, 254, 3202, 3728, 258, 54, 178, 8, 27, 7, 10, 2, 18, 237, 354, 19, 192, 356, 8, 27, 67, 402, 130, 37, 252, 1322, 83, 1177, 641, 1800, 37, 32, 13, 238, 103, 22, 85, 115, 213, 322, 46, 2274, 228, 98, 2, 1, 28, 99, 35, 21, 253, 100, 21, 25, 9, 197, 47, 2, 1, 352, 379, 21, 2112, 352, 379, 22, 17, 373, 1096, 1418, 355, 21, 332, 38, 925, 8, 617, 236, 55, 124, 68, 5, 21, 2112, 253, 166, 5, 102, 25, 1000, 2, 1, 213, 10, 108, 537, 189, 25, 21, 25, 268, 8, 17, 12, 22, 17, 1, 57, 200, 206, 3203]"

363,9,"A charming and great looking loose adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Snow Queen"" this animated gem from Disney has a lot going for it; catchy songs that are strong in both music and lyrics, terrific voice acting (I like that they bucked the trend of jamming in the most famous names they could in favor of actors who sound perfect as the characters), actually surprising plot twists, some real emotion, some witty humor, some dark and scary moments that don't pull all their punches, and most of all some really beautiful images using snow and ice. Jennifer Lee is, surprisingly, the first woman to (co) direct an animated feature for Disney, so it may be not for nothing that the film has a likable 'girl power' attitude, where the princesses take no back seat to the male characters in bravery or in action. The story involves two sisters, the eldest of whom has magical powers that can turn things to ice or snow, control the weather, and even, if used wrong, be deadly. So after an accidental near miss with her adored younger sibling, the two are kept separate, and grow up with decidedly different personalities. The film then jumps forward to the day of the eldest's coronation as queen. This brings joy to the younger, extroverted and lonely sister, as the palace will finally be opened, and she can see the world (and maybe fall in love), but dread to her older sister who fears not being able to control her powers, and being discovered as some sort of (unwilling) sorceress. Of course things do go awry, leading to all kinds of adventure and miss-adventure. There are the inevitable cliché's here and there, and a few bits seem stolen from other animated films, but these are very minor problems in a film that I thoroughly enjoyed, even though I'm many times older than the intended audience.","['charm', 'great', 'look', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'animate', 'gem', 'disney', 'lot', 'go', 'catchy', 'song', 'strong', 'music', 'lyric', 'terrific', 'voice', 'act', 'like', 'buck', 'trend', 'jamming', 'famous', 'name', 'could', 'favor', 'actor', 'sound', 'perfect', 'character', 'actually', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twist', 'real', 'emotion', 'witty', 'humor', 'dark', 'scary', 'moment', 'pull', 'punch', 'really', 'beautiful', 'image', 'use', 'snow', 'ice', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'surprisingly', 'first', 'woman', 'co', 'direct', 'animate', 'feature', 'disney', 'may', 'nothing', 'film', 'likable', 'girl', 'power', 'attitude', 'princess', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'male', 'character', 'bravery', 'action', 'story', 'involves', 'two', 'sister', 'eldest', 'magical', 'power', 'turn', 'thing', 'ice', 'snow', 'control', 'weather', 'even', 'use', 'wrong', 'deadly', 'accidental', 'near', 'miss', 'adore', 'young', 'sibling', 'two', 'kept', 'separate', 'grow', 'decidedly', 'different', 'personality', 'film', 'jump', 'forward', 'day', 'eldest', 'coronation', 'queen', 'brings', 'joy', 'young', 'extroverted', 'lonely', 'sister', 'palace', 'finally', 'open', 'see', 'world', 'maybe', 'fall', 'love', 'dread', 'old', 'sister', 'fear', 'able', 'control', 'power', 'discover', 'sort', 'unwilling', 'sorceress', 'course', 'thing', 'go', 'awry', 'lead', 'kind', 'adventure', 'miss', 'adventure', 'inevitable', 'clich', 'bit', 'seem', 'steal', 'animate', 'film', 'minor', 'problem', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'even', 'though', 'many', 'time', 'old', 'intend', 'audience']","[235, 25, 66, 937, 891, 44, 245, 467, 39, 49, 38, 3034, 2, 84, 13, 266, 11, 167, 58, 475, 1415, 86, 112, 9, 490, 1678, 903, 183, 54, 2005, 518, 259, 175, 8, 103, 1029, 52, 129, 195, 240, 1216, 222, 628, 1634, 133, 695, 1359, 22, 93, 1449, 158, 39, 33, 464, 416, 1179, 36, 251, 1263, 721, 38, 229, 2, 171, 156, 3, 402, 76, 24, 1536, 29, 55, 74, 966, 431, 8, 2310, 345, 12, 2357, 42, 15, 1838, 170, 24, 113, 43, 33, 39, 128, 986, 28, 158, 280, 2825, 2826, 449, 271, 1190, 73, 409, 42, 498, 786, 285, 4574, 140, 407, 3, 1439, 571, 138, 1838, 343, 49, 509, 738, 73, 4575, 930, 15, 383, 241, 318, 16, 126, 232, 186, 6, 3089, 64, 15, 187, 294, 128, 24, 987, 539, 2827, 228, 43, 13, 4373, 248, 193, 326, 271, 326, 2232, 274, 95, 75, 906, 38, 3, 670, 198, 3, 1243, 91, 28, 100, 61, 20, 64, 913, 159]"

FROZEN IS NOT BETTER THAN LOTR AND STAR WARS YOU IDIOTS. It is a dumb movie with awful songs a predictable story and stupid characters epically Olaf.

370,10,"I must say, I have never in my entire life experienced a film quite like this one before. ""Frozen"" is simply the greatest saga ever told on the big screen, it is the only movie that actually made me cry. It brought me great pleasures and tears of both joy and sadness, and it simply blew my mind away at how spectacular it really was. In later years, I had practically distanced myself from Disney-films, and the first time I found out about the film through an early trailer (not the one with Olaf and Sven), that made it look like a really sloppy and goofy work, I thought Disney might really have lost their way and their sense of quality, I wasn't excited at all, I thought it would seem like any ordinary moderate movie that maybe a few people might watch.A little time after I'd seen the trailer, and received extremely low expectations, a family member showed me a low-quality online-version of the movie (that someone apparently had stolen and uploaded onto an unheard-of-website on the world wide web). I was asked if I wanted to watch it, and although I was a bit sceptical and kind of didn't want to watch it, we ended up watching it. So here we were, watching this movie that I had no high hopes for at all, and then all of a sudden, the moment it started, I had a mysterious feeling. Despite the bad quality of this online-version, I was immediately hooked, and from there on, to my great surprise, it was just getting better and better.When the movie had ended, I needed to sit back for a while and comprehend what I had just witnessed. I came to one extraordinary and absolute conclusion; I had just seen the greatest movie I had ever experienced, and a movie well worthy of the title of ""the greatest movie ever made."" It came as the biggest and most welcome surprise. It was at that very moment I decided that this is really a movie that I would love to experience in great quality on the full big screen of a movie theatre, and I saw it several times, and every time I came out crying and being deeply satisfied. This film really succeeded to touch me deep into my heart and soul.""Frozen"" is really (and this just cannot simply be said in just one word) a stunning, iconic, epic, chilling, flawless, exciting, fascinating, powerful, beautiful, charming, magical, fantastic, amazing, spectacular, and utterly unforgettable masterpiece of a film that is really made for the whole family; boys and girls of all ages; kids, teens, adults and elders alike. Honestly, the most heartwarming movie of all time, and an instant cult-classic that will undoubtedly be ""watched and loved for generations!"" Is it worth noting the film even takes place in a Scandinavian land inspired by what is often labeled as ""the most beautiful country in the whole world?"" The movie (based upon the old 1800's-saga by H.C. Andersen) that Walt Disney himself started working on 70 years ago, as one of the first Disney-produced feature films, and that the company continued to develop later on, and it was now finally released and turned out to be their greatest success (earning 2 well deserved Oscars and a Golden Globe, along with receiving the title of ""the highest grossing animated film of all time"" and currently being on 6th place among the top ten highest grossing films of all time, and still going higher and staying strong). It really made me feel like I was watching a great good old classic from the 1900's, and I had suddenly rediscovered my love for Disney-films.This is now my #1 favourite movie, and I'll definitely buy it on DVD/Blu-ray when I find it in the store, it goes to my collection right away, along with the phenomenal soundtrack of course.

371,9,"Disney has never had quite such a streak of sheer quality as they had with their Renaissance, by which I mean their movies in the 90s, ranging from The Little Mermaid to Tarzan. All of them were at the very least above average, many of them to be counted among the very best, and quite honestly my Top Five Disney films consists of nothing but Renaissance films. They were all adaptations of beloved fairy tales and myths, all had gigantic Broadway style scores and focused on good, solid adventuring. Well, I say all. There was Rescuers Down Under, but that's something of a black sheep.Nevertheless, when people think about Disney films, they usually think about these films. Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Mulan. But then the team was broken, key people moved out of the studios and the magic of Disney, while by no means lost, never quite peaked like that. We still got plenty of Disney movies, but they were never phenomena like they used to be. Not until this film. People went nuts over this film, and for a good reason. It has it all. Phenomenal score, fantastic characters, gorgeous visuals and above all else, excellent, memorable story.There is a term called cultural keystone. For example, you only need to hum a few notes of Hakuna Matata to anyone who grew up during the 90s, and you can be assured that they can and probably will join you in singing it all along. Likewise, I believe, will be the case with Let it Go or Do You Wanna Build a Snowman. Children will obsess over this film because it is greater than the sum of its parts. It's storytelling on a deep, life-defining way. I learned a lot of my morals from The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, and I honestly believe that the kids of the 00s and 10s will learn a lot of theirs from Frozen.And yes, yes, it's not a perfect film. The villain has a great reveal, but has a pretty weak performance overall. The trolls can be a bit aggravating and I'm not one hundred percent sure the CGI will age gracefully, though I would bet a modest amount of money on that it will. But the story, the music and the characters are so good in this case that they easily compensate for the few flaws the film has.What can you say, it's a born classic.","['disney', 'never', 'quite', 'streak', 'sheer', 'quality', 'renaissance', 'mean', 'movie', 'range', 'little', 'mermaid', 'tarzan', 'least', 'average', 'many', 'count', 'among', 'best', 'quite', 'honestly', 'top', 'five', 'disney', 'film', 'consists', 'nothing', 'renaissance', 'film', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'fairy', 'tale', 'myth', 'gigantic', 'broadway', 'style', 'score', 'focus', 'good', 'solid', 'adventure', 'well', 'say', 'rescuer', 'something', 'black', 'sheep', 'nevertheless', 'people', 'think', 'disney', 'film', 'usually', 'think', 'film', 'aladdin', 'lion', 'king', 'beauty', 'beast', 'mulan', 'team', 'broken', 'key', 'people', 'move', 'studio', 'magic', 'disney', 'mean', 'lose', 'never', 'quite', 'peaked', 'like', 'still', 'get', 'plenty', 'disney', 'movie', 'never', 'phenomenon', 'like', 'use', 'film', 'people', 'go', 'nut', 'film', 'good', 'reason', 'phenomenal', 'score', 'fantastic', 'character', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'else', 'excellent', 'memorable', 'story', 'term', 'call', 'cultural', 'keystone', 'example', 'need', 'hum', 'note', 'hakuna', 'matata', 'anyone', 'grow', 'assure', 'probably', 'join', 'sing', 'along', 'likewise', 'believe', 'case', 'let', 'go', 'wan', 'build', 'snowman', 'child', 'ob', 'film', 'great', 'sum', 'part', 'storytelling', 'deep', 'life', 'define', 'way', 'learn', 'lot', 'moral', 'lion', 'king', 'beauty', 'beast', 'honestly', 'believe', 'kid', 'learn', 'lot', 'frozen', 'yes', 'yes', 'perfect', 'film', 'villain', 'great', 'reveal', 'pretty', 'weak', 'performance', 'overall', 'troll', 'bit', 'aggravate', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'sure', 'cgi', 'age', 'gracefully', 'though', 'would', 'bet', 'modest', 'amount', 'money', 'story', 'music', 'character', 'good', 'case', 'easily', 'compensate', 'flaw', 'film', 'say', 'born', 'classic']","[2, 88, 124, 2271, 2007, 283, 465, 218, 1, 958, 48, 422, 975, 250, 921, 61, 1430, 471, 34, 124, 542, 239, 731, 2, 3, 4581, 156, 465, 3, 891, 1280, 219, 114, 4418, 2105, 411, 355, 223, 261, 17, 664, 326, 18, 35, 89, 1172, 4582, 1554, 46, 37, 2, 3, 460, 37, 3, 485, 152, 97, 149, 203, 931, 486, 1245, 1165, 46, 242, 311, 150, 2, 218, 489, 88, 124, 9, 68, 19, 727, 2, 1, 88, 1981, 9, 158, 3, 46, 13, 2150, 3, 17, 180, 1583, 223, 253, 8, 444, 267, 270, 298, 268, 12, 657, 308, 1597, 396, 99, 1048, 625, 4511, 3689, 299, 285, 3209, 210, 813, 63, 172, 2788, 220, 514, 30, 13, 779, 202, 45, 70, 4184, 3, 25, 1404, 94, 689, 574, 79, 1206, 50, 347, 84, 551, 152, 97, 149, 203, 542, 220, 60, 347, 84, 5, 325, 325, 175, 3, 104, 25, 528, 136, 434, 493, 166, 123, 95, 3438, 10, 1540, 207, 555, 139, 100, 26, 1575, 3686, 624, 661, 12, 58, 8, 17, 514, 403, 3140, 386, 3, 35, 589, 69]"
372,10,"When people speak of their favorite Disney movies, the big four of the Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion. The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant. Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation. FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.Fantastico","['people', 'speak', 'favorite', 'disney', 'movie', 'big', 'four', 'renaissance', 'film', 'golden', 'age', 'animation', 'likely', 'mention', 'past', 'decade', 'see', 'disney', 'movie', 'hit', 'miss', 'consider', 'classic', 'forgotten', 'close', 'classic', 'yet', 'frozen', 'change', 'dynamic', 'creates', 'full', 'fledge', 'classic', 'frozen', 'classic', 'disney', 'classic', 'decade', 'could', 'position', 'best', 'disney', 'return', 'root', 'vengeance', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'past', 'year', 'opinion', 'story', 'heart', 'melt', 'fill', 'pure', 'feel', 'heart', 'become', 'staple', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'move', 'story', 'family', 'center', 'unpretentious', 'try', 'portray', 'comedy', 'hit', 'right', 'mark', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'thrill', 'journey', 'make', 'tale', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'exact', 'right', 'amount', 'dare', 'movie', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moment', 'stun', 'provoke', 'others', 'achieve', 'balance', 'true', 'triumph', 'story', 'tell', 'prof', 'exactly', 'disney', 'best', 'prove', 'back', 'produce', 'top', 'quality', 'film', 'affect', 'human', 'story', 'one', 'significant', 'startle', 'stun', 'beautifully', 'envision', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'relevant', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'stun', 'backdrop', 'intricacy', 'like', 'never', 'see', 'environment', 'costume', 'character', 'movement', 'among', 'thing', 'make', 'film', 'gigantic', 'step', 'forward', 'brilliant', 'voice', 'talent', 'breath', 'life', 'project', 'need', 'applaud', 'cast', 'consist', 'kristen', 'bell', 'veronica', 'mar', 'idina', 'menzel', 'wicked', 'among', 'many', 'others', 'bring', 'win', 'charm', 'superior', 'voice', 'act', 'magnificent', 'vocal', 'well', 'heart', 'tale', 'sensational', 'wit', 'humor', 'array', 'different', 'personality', 'emotion', 'triumph', 'fall', 'make', 'interest', 'character', 'people', 'relate', 'best', 'see', 'animation', 'cast', 'fully', 'become', 'character', 'score', 'music', 'perfect', 'score', 'grand', 'sound', 'texture', 'harmony', 'melody', 'class', 'beyond', 'anything', 'attempt', 'animation', 'studio', 'past', 'decade', 'would', 'place', 'song', 'movie', 'enchant', 'true', 'round', 'musical', 'triumph', 'song', 'stuck', 'mind', 'hum', 'even', 'know', 'belting', 'top', 'lung', 'good', 'song', 'progress', 'story', 'essential', 'part', 'meticulously', 'craft', 'breath', 'take', 'animation', 'affect', 'tale', 'bond', 'family', 'romance', 'hilarious', 'wit', 'humor', 'courtesy', 'character', 'especially', 'sweet', 'olaf', 'heart', 'stop', 'adventure', 'true', 'fairy', 'tale', 'would', 'say', 'could', 'well', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'generation', 'frozen', 'disney', 'magic', 'miss', 'long', 'come', 'full', 'force', 'fantastico']","[46, 641, 189, 2, 1, 106, 784, 465, 3, 796, 139, 21, 1016, 348, 276, 492, 16, 2, 1, 234, 271, 421, 69, 1017, 351, 69, 182, 5, 209, 988, 797, 246, 2297, 69, 5, 69, 2, 69, 492, 54, 1391, 34, 2, 385, 885, 2554, 34, 38, 3, 276, 47, 258, 12, 80, 359, 481, 724, 53, 80, 179, 1704, 34, 2, 1, 242, 12, 72, 649, 2298, 87, 1018, 279, 234, 130, 820, 345, 1184, 326, 1019, 337, 14, 114, 48, 95, 132, 1392, 130, 624, 1110, 1, 190, 798, 133, 315, 1607, 247, 1531, 677, 62, 989, 12, 143, 909, 522, 2, 34, 799, 74, 587, 239, 283, 3, 1076, 515, 12, 10, 1705, 2299, 315, 529, 2104, 910, 439, 1335, 444, 267, 315, 1821, 1947, 9, 88, 16, 1147, 1336, 8, 886, 471, 43, 14, 3, 2105, 668, 571, 523, 86, 800, 990, 79, 1020, 99, 1235, 227, 2106, 162, 146, 1532, 1533, 141, 116, 678, 471, 61, 247, 221, 374, 235, 1185, 86, 112, 935, 821, 18, 80, 114, 1948, 1455, 222, 2107, 140, 407, 240, 989, 186, 14, 122, 8, 46, 785, 34, 16, 21, 227, 822, 179, 8, 223, 58, 175, 223, 936, 259, 1148, 1608, 1186, 1283, 614, 212, 448, 21, 311, 276, 492, 26, 188, 11, 1, 615, 62, 911, 51, 989, 11, 954, 320, 1048, 28, 56, 1949, 239, 2108, 17, 11, 1149, 12, 1337, 94, 2555, 1021, 990, 55, 21, 1076, 114, 482, 72, 363, 364, 1455, 222, 2300, 8, 121, 457, 32, 80, 284, 326, 62, 219, 114, 26, 35, 54, 18, 48, 422, 149, 203, 616, 5, 2, 150, 271, 169, 40, 246, 272]"

374,-,"Disney has done it again with another animated masterpiece. Frozen has blown Tangled off the shelf, in my opinion, and set the bar for future Disney films. They even managed to bring back the appeal to both adults and children with witty characters and smart dialogue. While Its characters have all the potential to make a cliché storyline, it still manages to make itself unique and widely popular. But what sets it apart from other films in the Disney collection is their unorthodox representation of love. Frozen strays away from the immediate love at first sight ideal to the point of condemning it.

381,9,"Moving countries is a sure way to put all sorts of parts of your psyche to the test. The new culture(s), the change in weather patterns, missing your favourite café or radio station or park, the relationships to build .. all of these and so much more splash around the surfaces of the consciousness. You are out-of-place: you know it, others know it. It's obvious. When we moved to South Africa nearly 5 years ago we experienced all of this. It felt like we were constantly missing out on something. It's not so much destabilising as it is the creation of a whole new identity. Much of what you had become accustomed to building around you as part of your sense of self is gone and you have to do it all over again. One of the things I discovered I was missing out on was a name for this experience of missing out on things. I don't know if it's especially popular in this country or this part of this country, but I kept hearing and noticing 4 letters as part of speech. FOMO. It sounded like the name of a music festival; it would be casually slipped into a conversation and the locals would laugh. 'FOMO! Ahh...' Like the new car I hadn't seen before, it was suddenly everywhere. It stands for Fear Of Missing Out, and apparently it's a thing. I don't know where it came from and I'm not especially keen on finding out, but some people were having counselling or prayer ministry to deal with their FOMO. I was missing out on missing out. Another area I was missing out on had nothing to do with moving to South Africa, but has more to do with the fact that my wife and I don't have children. Though we both love films, this does mean that we tend to avoid seeing films that are aimed at more of an all-age audience and tend to concentrate on more 'adult' fare. (no, not that sort of adult). This means that sometimes we miss out; over the last couple of years it felt like we'd Missed Out in a very big way. Because, you see, we hadn't seen Frozen. Frozen is one of those animated films that has become a huge cultural icon. 'Let It Go' is everywhere. People are always posting hilarious versions of it on social media relating to news events or life in general; comments would be made about the cold not bothering me anyway. There were debates about how feminist it is, or isn't. None of which I watched, understood or partook in. I was Missing Out and I didn't like the feeling. Or so I thought. So we recorded it off the television, and did the decent thing last week. We watched it as originally intended - with an eleven year old who's currently staying with us along with her mother. Do you think you have ever Missed Out on something? Not only had the 11-year old not seen Frozen before, she's never seen snow or ice (we live in Cape Town). Most of you don't need me to tell you that Frozen is a really good film. The songs really do work; Let It Go is proper ear-worm fodder; the snowman and the reindeer are classic creations. I laughed out loud several times, as did the 11-year old. Finding ourselves thinking about fostering I thought ... if I was responsible for an 11-year old girl for whom I was responsible, would I want her to see this film? Yes, probably, I thought. Not only is it great fun but it's refreshing to see an animated princess who has agency and decision-making power and who isn't defined by the colour pink or her choice of man. It's got a way to go - I was a little troubled by the subtext that a woman's emotions affects everything and everyone around her - but this is much better a role model for young girls than many an all-age film I've come across before. For me it's a good animated film; up there with Up and Wall-E but not in Toy Story trilogy territory. But here's the thing; it was better when I hadn't seen it. Not having seen it had actually become part of me; a small part of me, but part of me nonetheless. I had gained a bit of cultural kudos from not having seen it; I was the person who hadn't seen Frozen!!! Now I was one of the crowd, just like everyone else. I was laughing at the jokes. I understand the lines about the cold not bothering me - but the thing is, it kind of does. It was a bit better on the outside.That shouldn't surprise me. People tend to experience me as a bit 'alternative'; just this week a friend in the same group discussion as me started laughing as soon as I took the microphone because he 'just knew you'd say something subversive'. I guess he was right; I talked about the way a certain passage of the Bible was used in demonic and dangerous ways by evangelicals like us.I need to watch this, though. Defining myself by something other than what Jesus says about me is very dangerous territory. I may prefer being a little on the edge but He says I'm chosen and accepted and in. If I'm not careful I could find myself frozen out just to make sure my fragile sense of self is intact. Better to get that from Him, not whether I've seen a given movie or what I think about a certain passage. Frozen is a good movie; I'm glad I've seen it. I do miss missing out, though. Not to worry. Big Hero 6 has just been released.","['move', 'country', 'sure', 'way', 'put', 'sort', 'part', 'psyche', 'test', 'new', 'culture', 'change', 'weather', 'pattern', 'miss', 'favourite', 'caf', 'radio',

382,7,"Well, I finally watched that Frozen movie all the kids have been talking aboutand it was good but it isn't exactly the thing everyone has made it out to be. Elsa (Idina Menzeljeez, John Travolta can you pronounce anything right?), the princess of Arendelle, possesses ice and snow powers but one night hurts her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), and this causes her parents to make Elsa repress her powers, to push them away and push people away, they are viewed as dangerous and uncontrollable. And then in a ridiculously fast montage of events, their parents die but we also experience what is one of the best pieces of music I've heard in a movie in quite some time, ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?"" But seriously, we go through like 10 years in less than ten minutes and Anna is 18 years old throughout the film and Elsa is 21 years old which is certainly older than most Disney protagonists I'm sure. Truly, the musical pieces are what carry this film from its very cliché plot elements without them the movie would feel more cliché than it already is, it's very typical Disney which isn't entirely a problem by any means and was more or less expected I think. But I also think the musical pieces wear thin by the 45 minute mark, the best pieces have already passed (""Let It Go"" and ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?"") and the other pieces don't really hold a candle to them which is quite unfortunate for the movie's lasting appeal as a full piece, the first half is better than the other half for sure as the latter half falls into typical plot conventions and the music justisn't that impressive. The animation is absolutely gorgeous though and as time goes on I've begun to love CGI animated films more and more especially if they continue to look this good. The setting, based on locations in Norway, look absolutely incredible throughout the entire piece and just goes to show the era of technology we are truly living in right now in the realm of animated films. I could certainly look at more of this for quite some time and would love to, visually; I'm extremely excited to see what Disney has up next. The movie as a whole though is actually more focused on Anna over Elsa, she is truly the main character as she learns what ""love"" is and trying to recover her relationship with Elsa after so many years have passed which I did not expect and I think it mostly works. The movie has a slew of side characters as well, Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, an iceman (he literally sells ice) who helps Anna out throughout the film and his side kick reindeer Sven who serves as decent comic relief throughout the film. Josh Gad as Olaf, a snowman who also serves as comic relief and has one of the better musical numbers about summer and lastly, Santino Fontana as Hans, a prince from the Southern Isles. These characters are interesting enough-although not very in depth-to keep the viewer entertained, I enjoyed them but they aren't incredibly memorable. My only real ""flaw"" of the film beyond the problems of obvious Disney clichés was the transition of Elsa early on in the film. She goes from extremely repressed about her ice powers but then immediately belts out ""Let It Go"" and feels very free from them and doesn't care anymore which is justuhhI don't know, weird? I feel in the minority about this, I think a transitional phase should have been placed before she belted out ""Let It Go,"" it would have made the transition feel more authentic as a whole. Regardless, Frozen is a welcome entry into Disney recent revival since The Princess and the Frog, I'm happy to see Disney really in a period similar to the 90s era, each year we are getting a fantastic film and it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon and as a lifelong fan of Disney, I'm really happy about all of this really but I would like to see a straying away from some of the clichés.","['well', 'finally', 'watch', 'frozen', 'movie', 'kid', 'talk', 'good', 'exactly', 'thing', 'everyone', 'make', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'jeez', 'john', 'travolta', 'pronounce',

383,8,"A simple premise with the different take of the ice queen that is misunderstood. With her family plays a vital role in this version, the story focuses more on the true love among relatives rather than the usual Disney romance. The visual notwithstanding, it looks as good as a current CG animated movie could be, with the animators focusing fully on the spectacle of snow and ice. It is not to be undermined with, the visual effects would definitely leave you in awe. The main characters are different enough with a twist from the usual Disney staples, giving enough variety to be entertaining throughout the movie. The performances in the musical scenes certainly touch the hearts of the viewers with their emotions shines through. It has to be mentioned that by knowing who voiced the ice queen, the experience of hearing her voice coming out of that character takes some time to get used to. The formula has been executed almost flawlessly but there are valid reasons for there to be differing opinions, especially on how the story eventually ends. It is a new, risky way for the studio to tell the classic story in this modern time that surely warrants praises as well as maybe criticisms from the minority that still attach to the classics. A great rebound follow up to 'Brave', showing another strong lead female character that emphasize on the strong value of family love.","['simple', 'premise', 'different', 'take', 'ice', 'queen', 'misunderstood', 'family', 'play', 'vital', 'role', 'version', 'story', 'focus', 'true', 'love', 'among', 'relative', 'rather', 'usual', 'disney', 'romance', 'visual', 'notwithstanding', 'look', 'good', 'current', 'cg', 'animate', 'movie', 'could', 'animator', 'focus', 'fully', 'spectacle', 'snow', 'ice', 'undermined', 'visual', 'effect', 'would', 'definitely', 'leave', 'awe', 'main', 'character', 'different', 'enough', 'twist', 'usual', 'disney', 'staple', 'give', 'enough', 'variety', 'entertain', 'throughout', 'movie', 'performance', 'musical', 'scene', 'certainly', 'touch', 'heart', 'viewer', 'emotion', 'shine', 'mention', 'know', 'voiced', 'ice', 'queen', 'experience', 'hearing', 'voice', 'come', 'character', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'use', 'formula', 'execute', 'almost', 'flawlessly', 'valid', 'reason', 'differ', 'opinion', 'especially', 'story', 'eventually', 'end', 'new', 'risky', 'way', 'studio', 'tell', 'classic', 'story', 'modern', 'time', 'surely', 'warrant', 'praise', 'well', 'maybe', 'criticism', 'minority', 'still', 'attach', 'classic', 'great', 'rebound', 'follow', 'brave', 'show', 'another', 'strong', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'emphasize', 'strong', 'value', 'family', 'love']","[516, 1222, 140, 55, 33, 49, 1994, 72, 204, 4363, 371, 435, 12, 261, 62, 6, 471, 3215, 191, 562, 2, 363, 450, 4594, 66, 17, 1481, 1303, 38, 1, 54, 812, 261, 822, 1506, 39, 33, 450, 278, 26, 174, 322, 2059, 119, 8, 140, 164, 129, 562, 2, 1704, 57, 164, 1519, 243, 296, 1, 493, 51, 90, 442, 260, 80, 479, 240, 1594, 348, 56, 521, 33, 49, 334, 995, 86, 40, 8, 55, 20, 19, 158, 534, 1450, 173, 2444, 180, 4595, 258, 121, 12, 652, 41, 108, 50, 311, 143, 69, 12, 324, 20, 960, 2789, 535, 18, 232, 1091, 3160, 68, 1764, 69, 25, 378, 335, 78, 102, 167, 248, 237, 8, 2174, 167, 728, 72, 6]"

The plot was convoluted, rushed, and there were many scenes that were too saccharine for my taste. The music of the movie was bad, just plain bad. Only one song was decent (mostly because of the great emotion of the scene itself, which mixed both joy and sorrow).But then, what was good? The humor!

386,7,"I am not always a big fan of Disney Animated movies. What with all the adorably naive princesses and prince charmings I always felt it was way too mushy for me. There were a few exceptions though Wreck-it Ralph, the best among them. Wreck-it Ralph followed similar child friendly, Disney style but instead of focusing on fairy tales and princesses, it was based on the world of video games and boy that was some ride. Yet another exception was 2010′s Tangled, which was a very enjoyable take on the Rapunzel fairy tale. The gorgeous visuals and intriguing characters all came alive with Tangled albeit with its own twists, and thus Disney got its formula.Enter Frozen. Disney's foray back to familiar territory after a short Wreck-it break. Without spoiling much, Frozen is based on the fairy tale, The Snow Queen and as family friendly as Disney animated goes, it doesn't have the least of dark side the fairy tale had. Its kinda like a prequel to the fairy tale with lush lovable characters and queen itself shown just a little bit 'misunderstood'.Being a Disney flick, it's undoubtedly a musical and all the tracks were so good that you could shake a leg to it. Wonderfully animated characters accompany the music which makes it a audio-visual treat. The characters themselves had enough personality to pull you through the narrative from start to end. The snowman Olaf was exceedingly hilarious and somehow reminded me of Sid from Ice Age.When I watched Tangled, I was bowled over with the visual quality, it had rich environments filled with colorful and well animated characters. Frozen was almost on par with it on the animation and graphical quality but somehow looked bland. Blame the snow, white and blue shades that saturated the locales it was slightly less visual than Tangled. But then again there was this particular scene where a character lift up another and the look and texture of fabric on the characters looked so absolutely fantastic that I forgot I was watching an animated movie. I know it could be just me, but I am glad I felt so and RIGHT THERE there an animated movies wins!In the end, Frozen, came as a surprise coz I wasn't interested when I saw the previews and I was less fascinated coz I was getting this instead of a Tangled sequel. But I am glad to say that I was pleasantly amused and entertained with Frozen. Kids will love it without doubt, but its a real feat for an animated movie when it can get adults glued to their seats and Frozen does just that.","['always', 'big', 'fan', 'disney', 'animate', 'movie', 'adorably', 'naive', 'princess', 'prince', 'charmings', 'always', 'felt', 'way', 'mushy', 'exception', 'though', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'best', 'among', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'follow', 'similar', 'child', 'friendly', 'disney', 'style', 'instead', 'focus', 'fairy', 'tale', 'princess', 'base', 'world', 'video', 'game', 'boy', 'ride', 'yet', 'another', 'exception', 'tangle', 'enjoyable', 'take', 'rapunzel', 'fairy', 'tale', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'intrigue', 'character', 'come', 'alive', 'tangle', 'albeit', 'twist', 'thus', 'disney', 'get', 'formula', 'enter', 'frozen', 'disney', 'foray', 'back', 'familiar', 'territory', 'short', 'wreck', 'break', 'without', 'spoil', 'much', 'frozen', 'base', 'fairy', 'tale', 'snow', 'queen', 'family', 'friendly', 'disney', 'animate', 'go', 'least', 'dark', 'side', 'fairy', 'tale', 'kinda', 'like', 'prequel', 'fairy', 'tale', 'lush', 'lovable', 'character', 'queen', 'show', 'little', 'bit', 'misunderstood', 'disney', 'flick', 'undoubtedly', 'musical', 'track', 'good', 'could', 'shake', 'leg', 'wonderfully', 'animate', 'character', 'accompany', 'music', 'make', 'audio', 'visual', 'treat', 'character', 'enough', 'personality', 'pull', 'narrative', 'start', 'end', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'exceedingly', 'hilarious', 'somehow', 'remind', 'sid', 'ice', 'age', 'watch', 'tangle', 'bowl', 'visual', 'quality', 'rich', 'environment', 'fill', 'colorful', 'well', 'animate', 'character', 'frozen', 'almost', 'par', 'animation', 'graphical', 'quality', 'somehow', 'look', 'bland', 'blame', 'snow', 'white', 'blue', 'shade', 'saturate', 'locale', 'slightly', 'less', 'visual', 'tangle', 'particular', 'scene', 'character', 'lift', 'another', 'look', 'texture', 'fabric', 'character', 'look', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'forgot', 'watch', 'animate', 'movie', 'know', 'could', 'glad', 'felt', 'right', 'animate', 'movie', 'win', 'end', 'frozen', 'come', 'surprise', 'coz', 'interested', 'saw', 'preview', 'less', 'fascinate', 'coz', 'get', 'instead', 'tangle', 'sequel', 'glad', 'say', 'pleasantly', 'amuse', 'entertain', 'frozen', 'kid', 'love', 'without', 'doubt', 'real', 'feat', 'animate', 'movie', 'get', 'adult', 'glue', 'seat', 'frozen']","[163, 106, 176, 2, 38, 1, 4166, 1144, 29, 82, 163, 155, 50, 4598, 645, 100, 352, 379, 34, 471, 352, 379, 378, 446, 70, 837, 2, 355, 208, 261, 219, 114, 29, 256, 126, 970, 925, 408, 1305, 182, 102, 645, 83, 306, 55, 527, 219, 114, 444, 267, 1723, 8, 40, 1301, 83, 2277, 129, 1348, 2, 19, 534, 1683, 5, 2, 4599, 74, 1077, 2140, 263, 352, 340, 137, 1056, 31, 5, 256, 219, 114, 39, 49, 72, 837, 2, 38, 13, 250, 628, 387, 219, 114, 629, 9, 4600, 219, 114, 1834, 726, 8, 49, 78, 48, 95, 1994, 2, 805, 1674, 51, 932, 17, 54, 2591, 2836, 1261, 38, 8, 1472, 58, 14, 2272, 450, 682, 8, 164, 407, 695, 802, 120, 41, 45, 32, 4601, 364, 981, 1047, 4280, 33, 139, 23, 83, 450, 283, 1613, 1147, 481, 1427, 18, 38, 8, 5, 173, 1028, 21, 283, 981, 66, 811, 1631, 39, 365, 991, 3218, 2992, 774, 321, 450, 83, 650, 90, 8, 1848, 102, 66, 1148, 3219, 8, 66, 292, 253, 1557, 23, 38, 1, 56, 54, 818, 155, 130, 38, 1, 374, 41, 5, 40, 445, 4602, 946, 157, 1568, 321, 1140, 4602, 19, 208, 83, 561, 818, 35, 1633, 828, 243, 5, 60, 6, 137, 681, 195, 2307, 38, 1, 19, 147, 3741, 966, 5]"
387,7,"Full of heart and humour, Frozen is a delightful film. The heavy and dark subject matter sets it apart from the traditional Disney style along with subtle postmodern mockery to the old Disney formula. The relationship between the two sisters works very well and is very touching from the get go supplying the films drama and emotional moments. The snowman Olaf supplies the comic relief and if it wasn't for him the film would be very depressing, when he livens up the characters he livens up the audience. One aspect of the story does resort to traditional Disney conventions which ruined it a little for me because of the radical new direction the film seemed to be taking. That being said the story is great but some of the songs just come out from no where with little warning and unlike Beauty and the Beast, aren't as memorable and have little variety with some sounding quite corny however some do show what the characters are going through. There are some genuine plot twists too that no one will see coming.Overall a great film perhaps not as innovative as Wreck it Ralph but Frozen is way ahead of it's competitors at Dreamworks and offers a charming story with three dimensional characters and a great message for kids about true love. The animation is also stellar and is very creative in terms of it's character design.","['full', 'heart', 'humour', 'frozen', 'delightful', 'film', 'heavy', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'set', 'apart', 'traditional', 'disney', 'style', 'along', 'subtle', 'postmodern', 'mockery', 'old', 'disney', 'formula', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'work', 'well', 'touch', 'get', 'go', 'supply', 'film', 'drama', 'emotional', 'moment', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'supply', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'would', 'depress', 'livens', 'character', 'livens', 'audience', 'one', 'aspect', 'story', 'resort', 'traditional', 'disney', 'convention', 'ruin', 'little', 'radical', 'new', 'direction', 'film', 'seem', 'take', 'say', 'story', 'great', 'song', 'come', 'little', 'warn', 'unlike', 'beauty', 'beast', 'memorable', 'little', 'variety', 'sound', 'quite', 'corny', 'however', 'show', 'character', 'go', 'genuine', 'plot', 'twist', 'one', 'see', 'come', 'overall', 'great', 'film', 'perhaps', 'innovative', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'frozen', 'way', 'ahead', 'competitor', 'dreamworks', 'offer', 'charm', 'story', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character', 'great', 'message', 'kid', 'true', 'love', 'animation', 'also', 'stellar', 'creative', 'term', 'character', 'design']","[246, 80, 732, 5, 1459, 3, 1376, 628, 1822, 375, 144, 512, 462, 2, 355, 172, 1302, 64, 2, 534, 153, 42, 15, 107, 18, 260, 19, 13, 1984, 3, 745, 342, 133, 45, 32, 1984, 309, 297, 3, 26, 2364, 4603, 8, 4603, 159, 10, 443, 12, 462, 2, 2259, 851, 48, 2818, 108, 754, 3, 75, 55, 35, 12, 25, 11, 40, 48, 1228, 766, 149, 203, 268, 48, 1519, 259, 124, 1737, 110, 78, 8, 13, 1342, 52, 129, 10, 16, 40, 166, 25, 3, 578, 1831, 352, 379, 5, 50, 1270, 1035, 705, 235, 12, 433, 751, 8, 25, 185, 60, 62, 6, 21, 27, 2207, 1014, 657, 8, 424]"

389,8,"Honestly I don't have any fetish for musical genre so the overture at spades of this animated film kind of putting me off in jaded mode but this sort of 'appetizer' only lasted for 10 minutes of the show, phew lucky me! The plot hits the stride upon entering the scene of the newly crowned Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) absconding her palace due to the false accusation of her treason for practicing black magic. Unwittingly Elsa unleashed her supernatural power which inadvertently spurred by her unstable emotion and eventually sets her kingdom into an eternal winter. Well here comes the best part, her highly exuberant and adventurous younger sister, Princess Anna (Kristen Bell) rode out from the palace for a thrilling quest finding her heartbroken Elsa to undo the spell. Anna combed through the slippery slopes icy-cold mountain and soon she stumbled upon a rugged mountain man, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) with his reindeer pet, Sven and also a queer talking snowman,Olaf. The foursome sets off an epic journey by crossing the dangerous path to find Elsa. Despite the simplicity written plots, Frozen churned out with an unpredictable twist towards the end upon Anna returning home reunited with Prince Hans(her first love), well that one really eat my heart out. I didn't see it coming at all! To make the plot thickened, the Frozen's screenwriter Jennifer Lee could have cast a sadistic, evil and dark witch like Mother Malkin, Maleficent among the famous dark witch you name it, from an adjacent kingdom and in addition, Prince Hans could have been her apprentice. Although the faction witchery might take the plot into another whole new level of some potential intricacy between characters; but at the same the writers might face some risk of turning this supposing light animated cartoon into misguided-version dark genre. Although I'm not really into musical genre, there was a brightest moment when Elsa climbing up to the top of the mountain and fabricated her dreamed ice castle while singing at the top of her lungs , 'Let it Go' (original voice by: Idina Menzel) indeed spurred some kind of euphoric whim in me, I just don't know why. Overall script-lines were decently written, but the best one which I felt emotionally related was that ""Reindeer(s) are Better Than People"" or more precisely overture sang by Kristoff to his reindeer, Sven. Character development remained to be seen on the trio protagonists- Elsa, Anna and Kristoff which was kind of good thing, but relatively I was rather amused by Olaf and Sven.

390,8,"""The Snow Queen"" - the title ""Frozen"" was just something some idiot marketing VP thought would sell more tickets - stands as a very good and arguably great return to form by Disney. This smart retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen classic mixes a few bold musical choices along with some hum-able pop climaxing with ""Let It Go"" which also accompanies the closing credits. Although computer generated, the animation nonetheless comes off as warm (pun intended) and not computer-y sans for the eyes of the two main sister characters which are a bit doll-like. The ""Let it Go"" sequence allows the computer animators to rare-back and show off how their technical virtuosity. The small-name cast means the characters shine through - imagine Robin Williams hamming it up and making a mess of Olaf the enchanted snowman character instead of the engaging job by Josh Gad. This reserve permeate the project and lends something of an air of the classic it may potentially grow into. In short, Disney, good to have you back.","['snow', 'queen', 'title', 'frozen', 'something', 'idiot', 'marketing', 'vp', 'thought', 'would', 'sell', 'ticket', 'stand', 'good', 'arguably', 'great', 'return', 'form', 'disney', 'smart', 'retell', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'classic', 'mix', 'bold', 'musical', 'choice', 'along', 'hum', 'able', 'pop', 'climax', 'let', 'go', 'also', 'accompanies', 'closing', 'credit', 'although', 'computer', 'generate', 'animation', 'nonetheless', 'come', 'warm', 'pun', 'intend', 'computer', 'sans', 'eye', 'two', 'main', 'sister', 'character', 'bit', 'doll', 'like', 'let', 'go', 'sequence', 'allows', 'computer', 'animator', 'rare', 'back', 'show', 'technical', 'virtuosity', 'small', 'name', 'cast', 'mean', 'character', 'shine', 'imagine', 'robin', 'williams', 'ham', 'make', 'mess', 'olaf', 'enchant', 'snowman', 'character', 'instead', 'engage', 'job', 'josh', 'gad', 'reserve', 'permeate', 'project', 'lends', 'something', 'air', 'classic', 'may', 'potentially', 'grow', 'short', 'disney', 'good', 'back']","[39, 49, 590, 5, 89, 2022, 1387, 92, 26, 718, 2070, 361, 17, 1390, 25, 385, 427, 2, 1001, 2250, 44, 245, 339, 69, 1119, 3100, 51, 862, 172, 1048, 294, 658, 792, 30, 13, 27, 3667, 2143, 662, 255, 642, 1286, 21, 1792, 40, 362, 1396, 913, 642, 4618, 336, 42, 119, 15, 8, 95, 1287, 9, 30, 13, 502, 1671, 642, 812, 1308, 74, 78, 1891, 601, 183, 227, 218, 8, 1594, 1137, 3746, 14, 1025, 32, 615, 45, 8, 208, 619, 373, 275, 257, 1313, 4619, 1020, 4620, 89, 1323, 69, 171, 2166, 285, 263, 2, 17, 74]"

Not so much like the film 'Shrek', with mature humor around every corner, (I'm not bashing Shrek, it is one of my all-time favorites) but more like 'Toy Story.' A movie with tons of child humor, and just enough to make the parents laugh too. Although, 'Frozen' is more of a juvenile film. Sure it has a few points were the adults will giggle, but it is mainly a child pleaser, which is still not a problem, given this is the point of a kids movie.

Similar to Elsa & Anna. This seems to be missing in a lot of past films.

411,10,"Frozen 1 is the best 3D Disney movies. This is the most favorite movie of mine. I have been seen this movie about a hundred times. I am just obsessed with this movie. The story is the heart melting story. All the age of audience will like it. Because whole movie was about two princesses, their dreams, self-discovery, fears, desires, and the most important things shows in this movie that was their unconditional love for each other.
There are lot of twist in this movie. You can see many things in there. It is daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. The environment, the costumes, gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops, and the character movement everything was made very perfectly. Frozen offers a fantastic, gorgeous take on the visual elements of winter. Deep blue ice, snowflakes, White Mountains contrasting with colored skies. The song of this movie was great. The voice, the background sound, the song, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in class of its own. After watching this movie you will not regret.
The movie mainly starts off with young Elsa and Anna playing with snow in their bedroom. Elder sister Elsa has the magical power to create snow. But Elsa magical power becomes curse for herself and his little sister that day when she accidently hit Anna with a blast of icy magic. Her parents went to the magical troll king who heals Anna but told them that she was lucky to have been hit in the head, not the heart. To keep Elsa's secret is secret, they surrounded the castle with walls and never let anyone inside. For this incidence the two sisters apart from each other. Even after their parents were lost in a storm at sea, the sisters didn't spend any time together which was devastates the younger Anna and Elsa's childhood. But once they reach adolescence and its Elsa's turn to take over the throne at age 18, the two experience an awkward reunion. But again two sister apart from each other when Elsa accidently plunges the sunny idyllic kingdom into permanent winter on the coronation day. A deadly mishap convinces her that she is born with a curse. Ashamed, fearful, flustered and heart broken, she distance herself from the world and goes into a self-proclaimed exile. But the fearless Anna decided she will find her sister and bring her back in the kingdom. In her journey, she teamed up with the rugged iceman, his loyal reindeer, and a naive snowman Olaf to seek out Elsa. They find Elsa in her icy castle and she accidently hits Anna in the heart now only true love can save her sister from death. In here the director showed their journey very adventure. Everything was visually stunning and emotionally. Even in there the animation was just outstanding and wonderful. In this movie you will cry, laugh, and feel amazing after watching this. It is deserving an Oscar. You can see the true love. Whole movie you will see that only true love can save the Anna's life. You can might be thought that the lip kiss from the prince can save the life of Anna. But in here the director gave a sweet and heart touching twist which melting your heart. The twist was that the true love did not found between the lovers, it was found between the two sisters. And this moment you will definitely cry because in here the writer very nicely showed the two sisters bonding, and their love for each other.","['frozen', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'favorite', 'movie', 'mine', 'see', 'movie', 'hundred', 'time', 'obsess', 'movie', 'story', 'heart', 'melt', 'story', 'age', 'audience', 'like', 'whole', 'movie', 'two', 'princess', 'dream', 'self', 'discovery', 'fear', 'desire', 'important', 'thing', 'show', 'movie', 'unconditional', 'love', 'lot', 'twist', 'movie', 'see', 'many', 'thing', 'dare', 'movie', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moment', 'stun', 'provoke', 'others', 'environment', 'costume', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'stun', 'backdrop', 'character', 'movement', 'everything', 'make', 'perfectly', 'frozen', 'offer', 'fantastic', 'gorgeous', 'take', 'visual', 'element', 'winter', 'deep', 'blue', 'ice', 'snowflake', 'white', 'mountain', 'contrast', 'color', 'sky', 'song', 'movie', 'great', 'voice', 'background', 'sound', 'song', 'texture', 'harmony', 'melody', 'class', 'watch', 'movie', 'regret', 'movie', 'mainly', 'start', 'young', 'elsa', 'anna', 'play', 'snow', 'bedroom', 'elder', 'sister', 'elsa', 'magical', 'power', 'create', 'snow', 'elsa', 'magical', 'power', 'becomes', 'curse', 'little', 'sister', 'day', 'accidently', 'hit', 'anna', 'blast', 'icy', 'magic', 'parent', 'go', 'magical', 'troll', 'king', 'heals', 'anna', 'told', 'lucky', 'hit', 'head', 'heart', 'keep', 'elsa', 'secret', 'secret', 'surround', 'castle', 'wall', 'never', 'let', 'anyone', 'inside', 'incidence', 'two', 'sister', 'apart', 'even', 'parent', 'lose', 'storm', 'sea', 'sister', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'devastates', 'young', 'anna', 'elsa', 'childhood', 'reach', 'adolescence', 'elsa', 'turn', 'take', 'throne', 'age', 'two', 'experience', 'awkward', 'reunion', 'two', 'sister', 'apart', 'elsa', 'accidently', 'plunge', 'sunny', 'idyllic', 'kingdom', 'permanent', 'winter', 'coronation', 'day', 'deadly', 'mishap', 'convinces', 'born', 'curse', 'ashamed', 'fearful', 'fluster', 'heart', 'broken', 'distance', 'world', 'go', 'self', 'proclaim', 'exile', 'fearless', 'anna', 'decide', 'find', 'sister', 'bring', 'back', 'kingdom', 'journey', 'team', 'rugged', 'iceman', 'loyal', 'reindeer', 'naive', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'seek', 'elsa', 'find', 'elsa', 'icy', 'castle', 'accidently', 'hit', 'anna', 'heart', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'sister', 'death', 'director', 'show', 'journey', 'adventure', 'everything', 'visually', 'stun', 'emotionally', 'even', 'animation', 'outstanding', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'cry', 'laugh', 'feel', 'amaze', 'watch', 'deserve', 'oscar', 'see', 'true', 'love', 'whole', 'movie', 'see', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'anna', 'life', 'might', 'thought', 'lip', 'kiss', 'prince', 'save', 'life', 'anna', 'director', 'give', 'sweet', 'heart', 'touch', 'twist', 'melt', 'heart', 'twist', 'true', 'love', 'found', 'lover', 'found', 'two', 'sister', 'moment', 'definitely', 'cry', 'writer', 'nicely', 'show', 'two', 'sister', 'bonding', 'love']","[5, 34, 2, 1, 189, 1, 2514, 16, 1, 1540, 20, 1244, 1, 12, 80, 359, 12, 139, 159, 9, 127, 1, 42, 29, 626, 429, 2647, 187, 1070, 289, 43, 78, 1, 4232, 6, 84, 129, 1, 16, 61, 43, 1110, 1, 190, 798, 133, 315, 1607, 247, 1147, 1336, 444, 267, 315, 1821, 8, 886, 132, 14, 456, 5, 705, 253, 444, 55, 450, 401, 105, 574, 991, 33, 1112, 365, 214, 956, 651, 1395, 11, 1, 25, 86, 617, 259, 11, 1148, 1608, 1186, 1283, 23, 1, 1900, 1, 934, 120, 73, 4, 7, 204, 39, 2090, 1139, 15, 4, 170, 24, 134, 39, 4, 170, 24, 380, 405, 48, 15, 138, 3750, 234, 7, 1712, 453, 150, 118, 13, 170, 123, 97, 4625, 7, 511, 1598, 234, 317, 80, 154, 4, 508, 508, 1353, 168, 1201, 88, 30, 299, 882, 42, 15, 512, 28, 118, 489, 713, 1002, 15, 1031, 20, 332, 73, 7, 4, 466, 1046, 3514, 4, 113, 55, 952, 139, 42, 334, 810, 4357, 42, 15, 512, 4, 3750, 2372, 3133, 77, 3509, 105, 343, 138, 2825, 3751, 2791, 589, 405, 2279, 1604, 80, 1245, 1486, 126, 13, 429, 4626, 1602, 1434, 7, 491, 71, 15, 221, 74, 77, 337, 486, 1371, 1908, 1502, 151, 1144, 45, 32, 997, 4, 71, 4, 453, 168, 3750, 234, 7, 80, 62, 6, 111, 15, 517, 770, 78, 337, 326, 132, 585, 315, 910, 28, 21, 764, 215, 1, 505, 190, 53, 96, 23, 483, 302, 16, 62, 6, 127, 1, 16, 62, 6, 111, 7, 79, 252, 92, 2515, 372, 82, 111, 79, 7, 770, 57, 457, 80, 260, 129, 359, 80, 129, 62, 6, 231, 1350, 231, 42, 15, 133, 174, 505, 605, 1231, 78, 42, 15, 4627, 6]"

I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the love at the heart of this fairytale is that of siblings, which isn't often seen and yet is so full of potential. Despite some notable issues with the plot, the picture manages to pull this off rather well. It doesn't escape the terrible parent trope, though; I mean, these guys were just asking for trouble when they locked their daughter away and taught her to fear her own emotions.

All other songs are amazing, they fit the tone of the movie and the leads are great singers as well.

423,7,"Well, the new animated fantasy film ""Frozen"" has gotten some great reviews and been doing excellent box-office, so I decided to check it out for myself---always have been a push-over for Disney animated films.First off, it's best if you put any comparisons between this film and the old fairy story ""The Snow Queen"" right out of your head immediately, because while the film is supposedly based on the fairy tale, there's pretty much nothing left of the original story. So, just go into the cinema thinking of this as something entirely new, and it will play better.Overall, I most definitely did enjoy the film and am glad I went. It's gorgeous to look at, and has some great vocal performances. Okay, it's true enough that off-hand I can't recall a single one of the songs (and I've just seen the film a few hours ago), but that's due more to my (typical) extreme forgetfulness than to a lack of memorability on the part of the score. At least a few of the tunes were quite strong, and I'm sure if I listened to the soundtrack a few times I'd get a better feel for the music, and decide which tunes were my favourites. (Yes, Broadway veteran Idina Menzel does in fact get her own show-stopping number, and it's quite impressive both visually and vocally.)Comic relief was thankfully kept within acceptable bounds---I LOVED the goofy reindeer, and while I wasn't particularly enamoured of Olaf the talking snowman, he wasn't nearly as annoying as I thought he'd be. (The early adverts featured the snowman to an excessive degree, but in fact the character had a much smaller part in the film than the adverts indicated.)However.... While I liked the film, perhaps I'm not feeling quite as enthusiastic about it as I thought I would. The plot in general seemed a bit weak, and the big climactic scene fell very flat indeed for me. I suppose I didn't find the heroine Anna to be particularly interesting--- the film is told from her perspective. But her sister Elsa, along with the male lead Kristoff, were the characters I wanted to see more of.This is one of those films that I'll have to see a few times before I come to a definite conclusion as to precisely how much I like it. Oh, I enjoyed it well enough that I'm likely to pick up the Blu-ray when it becomes available, so ask me again in a year or so what I thought and I'll have a much more detailed and well thought out review In the end, I believe I still prefer the production team's earlier animated film ""Tangled"" over this one; it seemed like a stronger picture. But---I've seen ""Tangled"" innumerable times by now, and am quite familiar with the material. A similar familiarity with ""Frozen"" may raise my opinion on this new film quite a bit---and remember, I'm not exactly complaining about it in the first place. I do recommend it-- -and it's a great way to help get in the mood for the upcoming holiday/winter season.","['well', 'new', 'animate', 'fantasy', 'film', 'frozen', 'gotten', 'great', 'review', 'excellent', 'box', 'office', 'decide', 'check', 'always', 'push', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'first', 'best', 'put', 'comparison', 'film', 'old', 'fairy', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'right', 'head', 'immediately', 'film', 'supposedly', 'base', 'fairy', 'tale', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'left', 'original', 'story', 'go', 'cinema', 'think', 'something', 'entirely', 'new', 'play', 'well', 'overall', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'glad', 'go', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'great', 'vocal', 'performance', 'okay', 'true', 'enough', 'hand', 'recall', 'single', 'one', 'song', 'see', 'film', 'hour', 'ago', 'due', 'typical', 'extreme', 'forgetfulness', 'lack', 'memorability', 'part', 'score', 'least', 'tune', 'quite', 'strong', 'sure', 'listen', 'soundtrack', 'time', 'get', 'well', 'feel', 'music', 'decide', 'tune', 'favourite', 'yes', 'broadway', 'veteran', 'idina', 'menzel', 'fact', 'get', 'show', 'stop', 'number', 'quite', 'impressive', 'visually', 'vocally', 'comic', 'relief', 'thankfully', 'kept', 'within', 'acceptable', 'bound', 'love', 'goofy', 'reindeer', 'particularly', 'enamour', 'olaf', 'talk', 'snowman', 'nearly', 'annoy', 'thought', 'early', 'advert', 'feature', 'snowman', 'excessive', 'degree', 'fact', 'character', 'much', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'advert', 'indicate', 'however', 'like', 'film', 'perhaps', 'feel', 'quite', 'enthusiastic', 'thought', 'would', 'plot', 'general', 'seem', 'bit', 'weak', 'big', 'climactic', 'scene', 'fell', 'flat', 'indeed', 'suppose', 'find', 'heroine', 'anna', 'particularly', 'interest', 'film', 'told', 'perspective', 'sister', 'elsa', 'along', 'male', 'lead', 'kristoff', 'character', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'film', 'see', 'time', 'come', 'definite', 'conclusion', 'precisely', 'much', 'like', 'oh', 'enjoy', 'well', 'enough', 'likely', 'pick', 'blu', 'ray', 'becomes', 'available', 'ask', 'year', 'thought', 'much', 'detailed', 'well', 'thought', 'review', 'end', 'believe', 'still', 'prefer', 'production', 'team', 'earlier', 'animate', 'film', 'tangle', 'one', 'seem', 'like', 'strong', 'picture', 'see', 'tangle', 'innumerable', 'time', 'quite', 'familiar', 'material', 'similar', 'familiarity', 'frozen', 'may', 'raise', 'opinion', 'new', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'remember', 'exactly', 'complain', 'first', 'place', 'recommend', 'great', 'way', 'help', 'get', 'mood', 'upcoming', 'holiday', 'winter', 'season']","[18, 108, 38, 545, 3, 5, 1271, 25, 161, 298, 598, 717, 491, 1310, 163, 809, 2, 38, 3, 36, 34, 196, 1126, 3, 64, 219, 12, 39, 49, 130, 317, 597, 3, 1290, 256, 219, 114, 136, 31, 156, 330, 230, 12, 13, 543, 37, 89, 1083, 108, 204, 18, 166, 174, 91, 3, 818, 13, 444, 66, 25, 821, 493, 420, 62, 164, 323, 924, 741, 10, 11, 16, 3, 487, 683, 404, 376, 2025, 273, 94, 223, 250, 804, 124, 167, 207, 531, 225, 20, 19, 18, 53, 58, 491, 804, 622, 325, 411, 3757, 141, 116, 201, 19, 78, 284, 184, 124, 933, 585, 309, 297, 1910, 498, 654, 2341, 2050, 6, 961, 151, 536, 4639, 32, 178, 45, 501, 238, 92, 594, 2692, 229, 45, 2605, 1561, 201, 8, 31, 601, 94, 3, 2692, 110, 9, 3, 578, 53, 124, 2839, 92, 26, 52, 623, 75, 95, 434, 106, 3235, 90, 843, 838, 826, 473, 71, 565, 7, 536, 122, 3, 511, 1141, 15, 4, 172, 431, 248, 67, 8, 59, 16, 10, 3, 16, 20, 40, 2131, 734, 4617, 31, 9, 425, 91, 18, 164, 1016, 1293, 1081, 1030, 380, 3236, 581, 47, 92, 31, 1488, 18, 92, 161, 41, 220, 68, 957, 700, 486, 846, 38, 3, 83, 10, 75, 9, 167, 438, 16, 83, 20, 124, 1077, 1080, 446, 5, 171, 760, 258, 108, 3, 124, 95, 391, 522, 1460, 36, 188, 262, 25, 50, 135, 19, 1084, 2674, 1039, 105, 1040]"
424,8,"Inspired by The Snow Queen, a 1844 fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, Disney's Frozen managed to be the highest grossing animated movie in box office history. Not to mention two Oscars it obtained, best animated feature and best original song.A lot of things make this is anyone's favorite, children and young adults alike. One of them is the soundtrack. The songs are so enjoyable nobody will say ""get it over already!"" or press the fast-forward button on their DVD player. Like in any musical films, the songs are in line with the events that happen in the movie, not only in imagination or daydreams.Although the animation technique is not so exceptional, Frozen can trap the viewers with its story. I was so touched to the point that I felt some empathy to Elsa and Anna. This is what makes it hard to move on.Most of the humor in this movie comes from Olaf the snowman. Not only cute, this guy is rich of characters. Olaf represents Elsa and Anna in many ways, he has the traits of both of them. He is sweet and lovable, and fills in the movie perfectly.And there is Kristen Bell (the best voice actress to me) that successfully made Anna's voice so delicious in my ears!","['inspire', 'snow', 'queen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'disney', 'frozen', 'manage', 'high', 'gross', 'animate', 'movie', 'box', 'office', 'history', 'mention', 'two', 'oscar', 'obtain', 'best', 'animate', 'feature', 'best', 'original', 'song', 'lot', 'thing', 'make', 'anyone', 'favorite', 'child', 'young', 'adult', 'alike', 'one', 'soundtrack', 'song', 'enjoyable', 'nobody', 'say', 'get', 'already', 'press', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'dvd', 'player', 'like', 'musical', 'film', 'song', 'line', 'event', 'happen', 'movie', 'imagination', 'daydream', 'although', 'animation', 'technique', 'exceptional', 'frozen', 'trap', 'viewer', 'story', 'touch', 'point', 'felt', 'empathy', 'elsa', 'anna', 'make', 'hard', 'move', 'humor', 'movie', 'come', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'cute', 'guy', 'rich', 'character', 'olaf', 'represent', 'elsa', 'anna', 'many', 'way', 'trait', 'sweet', 'lovable', 'fill', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'kristen', 'bell', 'best', 'voice', 'actress', 'successfully', 'make', 'anna', 'voice', 'delicious', 'ear']","[500, 39, 49, 219, 114, 44, 245, 339, 2, 5, 857, 206, 783, 38, 1, 598, 717, 636, 348, 42, 302, 3237, 34, 38, 229, 34, 230, 11, 84, 43, 14, 299, 189, 70, 73, 147, 725, 10, 225, 11, 306, 1170, 35, 19, 397, 2628, 780, 571, 2723, 540, 3758, 9, 51, 3, 11, 213, 618, 290, 1, 1251, 4640, 255, 21, 2340, 1846, 5, 900, 479, 12, 260, 117, 155, 4, 7, 14, 307, 242, 222, 1, 40, 32, 45, 265, 148, 1613, 8, 32, 1194, 4, 7, 61, 50, 1133, 457, 726, 481, 1, 456, 162, 146, 34, 86, 1495, 1509, 14, 7, 86, 939]"

While it's not better than The Lion King, it sure was a great movie.The night it opened I had planned on seeing The Book Thief, only it wasn't going to be played for another three hours. I already saw Catching Fire two days ago, so I went and saw this instead. And it was just absolutely incredible. Perhaps the best animated film I'd seen in years. I enjoyed it so much, that one seeing it once wasn't enough for me, I saw it a second time. I, like quite a lot of other viewers, was so ready to hate that snowman. After seeing him in one of the trailers I expected him to be really annoying. The moment he enters the screen he says something legitimately funny and ends up being a really heart warming character (haha) with that ""some people are worth melting for"" quote. Really loved the songs too. While they are no ""Circle of Life"", they are still catchy as heck. I was humming ""Let it Go"" all throughout the week of its release. I'm also really pleased that this movie won Best Original Song and for the first ever for Disney, Best Animated Feature. This year really hasn't been easy for me so far, and this film winning those two Oscars made the happiest I'd been in a while.

429,4,"4 of 10. While I was disappointed that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 didn't live up to the perfection of the original, it was still a solid cartoon film, and had much more realistic animation on water and water-like substances. This, compared to Disney's 2 most recent great cartoons, Tangled and Wreck it Ralph, has little other than solid ice to offer.Partially rescued by the ending, it is close to boring with some horrible casting/singing/song decisions that no one should have to suffer through cranked up on a theater sound system. I can't imagine anyone went to this to hear a country music musical mixed with a cartoon, yet that's what it sounds like.Most of the story is template made-for-TV tedium with some impressive ice-related animation and princess costumes to help it at least look beautiful. Most of the snow scenes are impressive too, with 2 important exceptions: melting snow and the snowman that looks like a stuffed toy in the snow.Better cartoons of the year, roughly in order of beautifullerness: Croods, Monsters, Inc.

432,10,"I didn't so much walk into the theater for this movie as I was borne into it on a wave of hype. I don't remember the last time an animated Disney movie has gotten this much buzz, and when a movie stays around for more than two months after its release I figure it's probably worth checking out. So does it deserve the hype? I would say so. The animation, for one thing, is spectacular. This is no new information, of course, but it warrants mentioning. Even if you find Disney musicals unbearable you could still mute this movie and have a heck of a time just looking at everything. And speaking of the musical numbers they were considerably better than I expected. I may not rate it on par with the likes of the Lion King, but the music in Frozen was still very catchy and and is sure to get stuck in your head all day no matter what else you listen to. In a good way, of course. The plot was very fascinating and engaging and it's full of twists that you can appreciate even if you see them coming. My only qualm is the lack of explanation for the magic involved. Most Disney magic is really only used to motivate the plot and that's usually OK, but the magic in Frozen seemed to have more depth to it and I would appreciate it being explained a bit more. That aside, though, Frozen is definitely a worthwhile movie for Disney fans young and old and I would recommend seeing it before it goes away.","['much', 'walk', 'theater', 'movie', 'borne', 'wave', 'hype', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'animate', 'disney', 'movie', 'gotten', 'much', 'buzz', 'movie', 'stay', 'around', 'two', 'month', 'release', 'figure', 'probably', 'worth', 'check', 'deserve', 'hype', 'would', 'say', 'animation', 'one', 'thing', 'spectacular', 'new', 'information', 'course', 'warrant', 'mention', 'even', 'find', 'disney', 'musical', 'unbearable', 'could', 'still', 'mute', 'movie', 'heck', 'time', 'look', 'everything', 'speak', 'musical', 'number', 'considerably', 'well', 'expect', 'may', 'rate', 'par', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'music', 'frozen', 'still', 'catchy', 'sure', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', 'day', 'matter', 'else', 'listen', 'good', 'way', 'course', 'plot', 'fascinate', 'engage', 'full', 'twist', 'appreciate', 'even', 'see', 'come', 'qualm', 'lack', 'explanation', 'magic', 'involve', 'disney', 'magic', 'really', 'use', 'motivate', 'plot', 'usually', 'ok', 'magic', 'frozen', 'seem', 'depth', 'would', 'appreciate', 'explain', 'bit', 'aside', 'though', 'frozen', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'disney', 'fan', 'young', 'old', 'would', 'recommend', 'see', 'go', 'away']","[31, 669, 312, 1, 2256, 406, 391, 197, 20, 38, 2, 1, 1271, 31, 2017, 1, 510, 200, 42, 860, 288, 630, 210, 254, 1310, 483, 406, 26, 35, 21, 10, 43, 671, 108, 2841, 228, 2789, 348, 28, 71, 2, 51, 3238, 54, 68, 3239, 1, 1325, 20, 66, 132, 641, 51, 184, 18, 131, 171, 694, 1028, 9, 152, 97, 58, 5, 68, 266, 207, 19, 954, 317, 138, 375, 270, 531, 17, 50, 228, 52, 1140, 619, 246, 129, 699, 28, 16, 40, 3463, 273, 806, 150, 584, 2, 150, 22, 158, 3217, 52, 460, 477, 150, 5, 75, 609, 26, 699, 400, 95, 716, 100, 5, 174, 1907, 1, 2, 176, 73, 64, 26, 262, 16, 13, 101]"

435,9,"Frozen(2013) is one of the most beautiful movies of the entire season. I am amazed to see Elsa for being the first Disney princess to say""you can't marry a man you just met"" when Anna asked her to bless for their marriages(Han and Anna). First, i thought Han is going to be a true love for Anna but actually, my thought was completely wrong. He's a villain who is trying to take control over Arendelle. Moreover, some of the songs were catchy. It does get ingrained into your brain and you will be singing the song over and over again. Frozen is incredibly touching story with fantastic plots, and scripts. The movie was beautifully composed because the characters and their performances are absolutely delightful. The story center is more on the sisters relationship than a romantic one (heart melting story which has a family as its center). Last but not least, Frozen is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at some moments with the hilarious little snowman named Olaf who is probably my favorite character in the movie. But also touching in some parts and i bet you might need a box of tissues next to you. I have to say that this movie is highly demonstrated the sibling bond with tenderness which is deserving to win an Oscar award. I would recommend all of you to watch this beautiful and entertain movie and i would rate it 9 out of 10. Hope you enjoy it.","['frozen', 'one', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'entire', 'season', 'amaze', 'see', 'elsa', 'first', 'disney', 'princess', 'say', 'marry', 'man', 'met', 'anna', 'ask', 'bless', 'marriage', 'han', 'anna', 'first', 'thought', 'han', 'go', 'true', 'love', 'anna', 'actually', 'thought', 'completely', 'wrong', 'villain', 'try', 'take', 'control', 'arendelle', 'moreover', 'song', 'catchy', 'get', 'ingrain', 'brain', 'sing', 'song', 'frozen', 'incredibly', 'touch', 'story', 'fantastic', 'plot', 'script', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'compose', 'character', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'story', 'center', 'sister', 'relationship', 'romantic', 'one', 'heart', 'melt', 'story', 'family', 'center', 'last', 'least', 'frozen', 'dare', 'movie', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moment', 'hilarious', 'little', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'probably', 'favorite', 'character', 'movie', 'also', 'touch', 'part', 'bet', 'might', 'need', 'box', 'tissue', 'next', 'say', 'movie', 'highly', 'demonstrate', 'sibling', 'bond', 'tenderness', 'deserve', 'win', 'oscar', 'award', 'would', 'recommend', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'entertain', 'movie', 'would', 'rate', 'hope', 'enjoy']","[5, 10, 93, 1, 264, 1040, 96, 16, 4, 36, 2, 29, 35, 390, 145, 392, 7, 581, 2423, 1057, 44, 7, 36, 92, 44, 13, 62, 6, 7, 103, 92, 291, 280, 104, 87, 55, 128, 199, 2091, 11, 266, 19, 4648, 1242, 63, 11, 5, 603, 260, 12, 253, 52, 395, 1, 529, 1203, 8, 493, 292, 1459, 12, 649, 15, 153, 393, 10, 80, 359, 12, 72, 649, 197, 250, 5, 1110, 1, 190, 798, 133, 364, 48, 45, 183, 32, 210, 189, 8, 1, 27, 260, 94, 1575, 252, 99, 598, 418, 35, 1, 472, 1954, 409, 482, 4018, 483, 374, 302, 469, 26, 262, 23, 93, 243, 1, 26, 694, 384, 91]"
436,8,"Disney's FROZEN is a really great film by all means, but is it perfect and amazing than High School Musical 2, which is also a movie distributed by Walt Disney Pictures? Yes, it is. Is it far being the best Disney movie ever made? Simply and positively, No. Is the movie better than any other musical film? Yes and no.Inspired by a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, ""The Snow Queen"", FROZEN tells the story of a fearless princess named Anna, who sets out an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, Kristoff, his loyal pet reindeer Sven, and a naive snowman named Olaf, who loves summer to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.Watching this movie for the first time, I had no idea what the hell was this movie was going to be about or if I was going to like it or not because the trailer did not give any plot details away.I really hoped I could like this movie because the director of this film, Chris Buck, also directed another Disney film, TARZAN. I was pleased with the results and not pleased with some of the things.The first few minutes of this movie got me thinking it was going to be just a regular girls movie about a princess meeting a prince and they fall in love kind-of-a-movie. The film did not focus on any romantic relationship at all as this film focused on the two main characters Anna and Elsa.Elsa (played by Indina Menzel) was a character that I had mixed feelings over when I first saw this film and the CGI is well cool on her character and her powers are just fantastic to see in Disney Digital 3D, way back in November 2013.Anna (played by Kristen Bell) is really fantastic and she is a character that you would like to see throughout the whole film and the animation and CGI on her is really amazing. Kristoff (played by Johnathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven are cool with the animation really done on them as well too.Hans (played by Santino Fontana) is really a good antagonist for the film and the way his animation is done on him was just impressive as hell, but I really think his character is simply evil.Then, finally, my favorite character of the entire film, which is the little snowman Olaf (played by Josh Gad) and his CGI and animation is really great and is really fantastic and I thought it was really amazing to see a living and breathing little snowman on screen.Those performances in the film were just excellent. The songs in this film is really amazing and just a joy to hear. My favorite songs in the film is ""For The First Time in Forever"", ""Let It Go"" - both the Indina Menzel and Demi Lovato versions, ""Do You Want to Build A Snowman?"" and the song that Olaf sings called, ""I Love Summer"" and also, there may be way too many songs in this film, but as a Disney movie musical, it works.The musical score composed by Christophe Beck and his musical score is just amazing as his musical score for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel were simply incredible. But back to the musical score, his score is just extraordinary and his female-choir that he used for this film is just amazing.The film gives you a lot of very funny laughs that everyone can enjoy and laugh at. The characters, like I said, are all original and very amazing and fantastic and just incredibly well-done and is very spectacular.The only criticism I have is that there are parts where the characters just break out into song, and don't get me wrong, they do this in all musical movies, but with FROZEN, it is no different.I find one of the main characters already singing and just break out singing in this film and I'm sometimes, while watching the film, ""Come on, man! Do you really have to do that?"".The plot is very cliché in a few areas, but it's still an enjoyable plot and I wish that some animated movies stay true to their original source material, but for whatever reason, with all or some movies, this film can't seem to do that.This movie is as fun for my sisters and all kids and teenagers, because it is a Disney musical released and it is the best Disney film in 10 years and to hear that this movie took a long time to make, really helped make this movie the best that it can be.The film is not as good as TARZAN or the Disney / Pixar's TOY STORY film franchise and it is not the best Disney film in the world, but it could not have been done better and it also could have been a hell of a lot worse.FROZEN will make you laugh, cry, sing and have you re-watch this movie for a good 26 days or a good 10 days and it is a definitive great family film.This is the way a Disney musical film, live action or animation, and all musical films in general should be made. It should be about the plot, characters and music all at once.This film gets a 8 out of 10 - again, not the best Disney film in the world, but it could have been worse, but it is a great film overall.","['disney', 'frozen', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'mean', 'perfect', 'amaze', 'high', 'school', 'musical', 'also', 'movie', 'distribute', 'walt', 'disney', 'picture', 'yes', 'far', 'best',

I absolutely adored this film. It is one of the best Walt Disney Animation Studios movies of all time, right up there with The Lion King, Tarzan, Tangled & Wreck-It Ralph. The 3D in the film is enchanting. The Disney short film called Mickey's Sound Cartoon was nostalgic, hilarious & modern simultaneously, thanks to the use of 3D. The soundtrack of the movie is peppy & melodious at the same time. The cast lend their voices to each of the characters, flawlessly. They sing brilliantly as well. Kristen Bell is outstanding as Anna. Idina Menzel is spectacular as Elsa. Jonathan Groff is mind blowing as Kristoff. Josh Gad stole the show as the hilarious snowman, Olaf. Gad's hilarious one-liners will leave you in splits every time Olaf appears on screen. Santino Fontana is great as Hans. Alan Tudyk is mind blowing as the Duke.

440,10,"Frozen is supposed to be Disney's version of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen. I recently read The Snow Queen, and I can find little or no resemblance between the movie and the classic story. That being said, Frozen is a marvelous Disney movie! The opening sequence shows ice cutters, singing while at work. This reminded me of the roustabout scene that opened Dumbo. We see a boy with his pet reindeer, trying hard to work with the men and generally just getting in the way. Two sisters, princesses Elsa and Anna, are very close and love to play together. The eldest, Elsa, was born with the ability to create snow and ice, and Anna would often wake her sister up so that they can play snow games in the great ballroom of the palace. One night, however, Anna becomes so exuberant that Elsa's attempt to protect her (by making soft snow hills for Anna to fall into) goes wrong, and Anna is hit by a magic burst to the head. The king and queen rush Anna to the Troll King, who is able to reverse the damage and also removes Anna's memories of her sister's magic ability. From then on, Elsa is taught to control this ability by pushing down her emotions and by wearing gloves. She cloisters herself in her room and no longer plays with her little sister. Of course, Anna has no memory of the accident, so she doesn't understand why Elsa is so distant. The gates of the palace are closed, so Anna has little interaction with people. After the death of the king and queen, Elsa is to be crowned the new queen as she comes of age in the summer. Elsa and Anna are virtual strangers at this point. Anna falls in love with the first young man she meets, Hans, a prince from a different kingdom. When she announces this to her sister, Elsa is outraged and states that the wedding will not take place. Anna tries to argue and accidentally pulls off one of Elsa's gloves. Elsa's emotion releases her power and imprisons the kingdom in ice and deep snow. Elsa flees the kingdom and Anna takes off to find her, leaving Hans to take care of the kingdom while she is gone. Elsa secludes herself in an ice palace she creates in the mountains (think Fortress of Solitude, only much prettier.) Anna meets Kristoff and his reindeer, Sven, who help her on her search. Kristoff was the little boy we saw at the beginning of the movie. She also runs into the snowman, Olaf, that she and Elsa had built on the fateful day she had been injured and now is alive. Kristoff had been raised by trolls. He and Olaf provide support and comic relief. The music is wonderful, the plot is well-planned, the ending is satisfying and this movie actually kept my four-year-old niece interested for more than 15 minutes at a stretch. My only qualifier is that the Mickey Mouse cartoon that was included on the DVD is excessively violent and not funny. It is a modern cartoon that was drawn in the ""old"" Disney style, so the viewer thinks it is a classic as it starts. I felt cheated. Other than that, I highly recommend Frozen for all ages.

441,9,"Frozen is a worthy successor to Disney's very best features. It manages to be magical, fun and exciting whilst still breaking out as a modern Disney film with more complex characters and strong themes. The focal point of the movie is not a traditional clash of good and evil nor the search of the one true love. The movie's heart is the troubled and frozen relationship of the two protagonists, the princess Anna and Elsa, the modern Snow Queen. Instead of an evil and selfish tyrant, Elsa is a gentle and kind young woman, yet insecure and vulnerable, struggling to control her powers of ice, which frighten herself more than anyone else. Her fear of hurting other causes her to isolate herself growing up, forcing the sisters to grow apart. And when her powers accidentally create an eternal winter, Elsa banishes herself in order to protect the kingdom and her precious sister from herself. Anna, however, grown to be an optimistic young woman full of life and joy, sets out to find her to melt the kingdom and also mend the sisters' troubled relationship. As the movie puts it, ""Thaw the frozen heart.""Frozen looks great. Nay, it's stunning. The mountains, plains, iced rivers, snowflakes and iced castles of northern Scandinavia add a nice change of scenery for Disney films, and it's done splendidly. The visuals are top-notch. The landscape, obviously, but also the way the characters have been brought to life. Their movement is realistic, their faces display multiple individual emotions excellently and the voice cast is spot on. It looks like Disney-characters haven't been this lively since Timon did the hula.While openly making fun of some old Disney trademarks (""You can't marry someone you just met!""), it keeps the familiar magic alive, and not with just the visuals. The characters are plausible, fresh, evolving and easy to relate to, the songs are powerful (albeit occasionally nonsensical) and the plot divers from the source material (H. C. Andersen's Snow Queen) in the most refreshing of ways. Besides the adventure, the with and the occasional romance, it is above all a beautiful and heart- melting film about sisterly love and the lengths they would go for each other.A classic fairy tale with modern values, stunning visuals, lively cast and compelling themes, the tale should have no trouble winning over the hearts of the old and new fans. It's beautiful, it's touching, it's exciting and it's silly; Frozen is everything one could ever hope for a Disney.","['frozen', 'worthy', 'successor', 'disney', 'best', 'feature', 'manages', 'magical', 'fun', 'excite', 'whilst', 'still', 'break', 'modern', 'disney', 'film', 'complex', 'character', 'strong', 'theme', 'focal', 'point', 'movie', 'traditional', 'clash', 'good', 'evil', 'search', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'movie', 'heart', 'troubled', 'frozen', 'relationship', 'two', 'protagonist', 'princess', 'anna', 'elsa', 'modern', 'snow', 'queen', 'instead', 'evil', 'selfish', 'tyrant', 'elsa', 'gentle', 'kind', 'young', 'woman', 'yet', 'insecure', 'vulnerable', 'struggle', 'control', 'power', 'ice', 'frighten', 'anyone', 'else', 'fear', 'hurt', 'cause', 'isolate', 'grow', 'force', 'sister', 'grow', 'apart', 'power', 'accidentally', 'create', 'eternal', 'winter', 'elsa', 'banishes', 'order', 'protect', 'kingdom', 'precious', 'sister', 'anna', 'however', 'grown', 'optimistic', 'young', 'woman', 'full', 'life', 'joy', 'set', 'find', 'melt', 'kingdom', 'also', 'mend', 'sister', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'movie', 'put', 'thaw', 'frozen', 'heart', 'frozen', 'look', 'great', 'nay', 'stun', 'mountain', 'plain', 'iced', 'river', 'snowflake', 'iced', 'castle', 'northern', 'scandinavia', 'add', 'nice', 'change', 'scenery', 'disney', 'film', 'splendidly', 'visuals', 'top', 'notch', 'landscape', 'obviously', 'also', 'way', 'character', 'brought', 'life', 'movement', 'realistic', 'face', 'display', 'multiple', 'individual', 'emotion', 'excellently', 'voice', 'cast', 'spot', 'look', 'like', 'disney', 'character', 'lively', 'since', 'timon', 'hula', 'openly', 'make', 'fun', 'old', 'disney', 'trademark', 'marry', 'someone', 'met', 'keep', 'familiar', 'magic', 'alive', 'visuals', 'character', 'plausible', 'fresh', 'evolve', 'easy', 'relate', 'song', 'powerful', 'albeit', 'occasionally', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'diver', 'source', 'material', 'h', 'c', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'refresh', 'way', 'besides', 'adventure', 'occasional', 'romance', 'beautiful', 'heart', 'melt', 'film', 'sisterly', 'love', 'length', 'would', 'go', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'modern', 'value', 'stun', 'visuals', 'lively', 'cast', 'compelling', 'theme', 'tale', 'trouble', 'win', 'heart', 'old', 'new', 'fan', 'beautiful', 'touch', 'excite', 'silly', 'frozen', 'everything', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'disney']","[5, 790, 4650, 2, 34, 229, 825, 170, 125, 447, 1130, 68, 340, 324, 2, 3, 771, 8, 167, 226, 3244, 117, 1, 462, 4651, 17, 277, 793, 10, 62, 6, 1, 80, 1963, 5, 153, 42, 354, 29, 7, 4, 324, 39, 49, 208, 277, 1558, 4, 3229, 193, 73, 251, 182, 2844, 2491, 639, 128, 24, 33, 1516, 299, 270, 187, 305, 328, 1438, 285, 272, 15, 285, 512, 24, 300, 134, 310, 105, 4, 2845, 496, 513, 77, 2489, 15, 7, 110, 1107, 1268, 73, 251, 246, 79, 738, 144, 71, 359, 77, 27, 2504, 15, 1963, 153, 1, 196, 775, 5, 80, 5, 66, 25, 315, 214, 915, 2724, 1112, 2724, 168, 3375, 2071, 269, 192, 209, 1217, 2, 3, 267, 239, 1129, 889, 613, 27, 50, 8, 599, 79, 886, 640, 381, 1151, 1418, 1921, 240, 2201, 86, 227, 1278, 66, 9, 2, 8, 1559, 98, 3072, 3765, 14, 125, 64, 2, 2846, 390, 304, 392, 154, 1077, 150, 1301, 267, 8, 4652, 819, 3623, 454, 785, 11, 439, 2277, 2676, 2127, 52, 1092, 1080, 2051, 1781, 339, 39, 49, 1010, 50, 877, 326, 1422, 363, 93, 80, 359, 3, 711, 6, 1465, 26, 13, 69, 219, 114, 324, 728, 315, 267, 1559, 227, 1239, 226, 114, 1073, 374, 80, 64, 108, 176, 93, 260, 447, 847, 5, 132, 10, 54, 81, 384, 2]"

Nowadays Pixar tries too hard and misses sometimes on films they mostly do well because it's Disney but this brings it back to what it is suppose to be. It gives all the emotions of suspense, romance, comedy, thrilling and other. I don't think Pixar was apart of this film though. I never saw a short before it started or never saw the classic bouncing lamp. Maybe Disney will realize something here. Maybe Pixar focuses on modern stories when Walt Disney Studios focuses on the magical, fantasy part.

It's also the only movie that I've rewatched 3 times in the theater and still not get bored with. The story and characters are great, and animation is top notch and rivals that of PIXAR,who are in a bit of a slump these past few years making one mediocre flick after another.

Frozen has probably my favourite twist on the act of true love where its typically a kiss.

449,10,"Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel are the core to this wonderful Disney movie. Their sisterly chemistry feels both authentic and beautiful. It broke my heart every time Elsa closed the door on Anna. The antagonists were almost unnecessary. The theme of Elsa's self enforced isolation out of the need to protect her sister was enough of an obstacle to fill the story. I think Disney could have gone a little bit more to the ""dark side"" and allowed her loneliness take her deeper onto a twisted path, but maybe that would have made it less watchable for younger kids.I think the need to portray villains as villain-y is currently on the wane. We're less enamoured of traditional pure good vs evil stories, and we've developed a taste for antagonists that are more ""grey"" in their motives. In Elsa, we had the beginnings of a potential ""villain"" that lacked all the trademarks of a villainous role - in fact, most of us likely sympathized with her more than those she put in jeopardy.

450,10,"This is honestly one of my favourite films ever! The first time I saw it I came out of the cinema and thought this is brilliant, it felt like Disney has proved that it can still make a magical film! Although the horrible truth is that I never really wanted to see the film in the first place, I didn't really like what the trailer showed and I hadn't seen a Disney film in a few years. So when I was invited to go see the film I thought sure why not it's a free trip to the cinema and if I didn't like the film then it would be no skin off my nose. I am so glad that I did see it though and I loved every moment about it! I loved the songs! I loved the characters! I loved the settings! I loved the plot! I loved the story (or how they managed to adapt the story since it was a 13 year work in progress!). After getting out of the cinema I told my family how amazing it was, so after a couple of weeks I saw for a second time with my family and still loved it, plus my family loved it too! My mum was shocked at how much better it was than what she had expected! So come the restart of the school year after Christmas, I could not stop humming or singing the songs from the film (by the way at this point I should point out that I am a 16 year old guy!) so when I started telling my friends about it, some of them thought I was mad and some wanted to see the film for themselves. This brings me on to my third sitting of Frozen! in 3D! in which me and a friend went to go see at our local cinema (before hand I had thought of each scene and what the added 3D could do to it, again I was not displeased!). Got out of the cinema and though it just keeps getting better! Now at this point when I told people that I had seen the film 3 times and once in 3D, almost all of them thought I was mad! (bar a few) So after settling down and studying I thought right I've seen the film 3 times once in 3D, I won't see it again in the cinema I'll buy it on DVD nuff said. ooooohhhh no! After me and a few others kept going on about it, one of my friends cracked and decided that they wanted to see it too, then they asked if I and a few of our other friends wanted to go see it, so naturally I said yes! Now this! The forth time! I just couldn't contain myself and had to sing-a-long to the magnificent songs in this film, it's safe to say my friends weren't so pleased but after the first few songs they knew that they weren't going to shut me up! Got out of the cinema this time and thought that it had still had the same entertainment factor as the first time that I saw it! Unfortunately I don't believe I will get to go to the sing-a-long showings of this film due to lack of time but it's OK because I can sing-a-long and watch the film as many times as I want when the film comes out on DVD, This will be a day of days! :) So in conclusion, as the title of this review says: Must See!!! You really have to see it! Please I don't know one person yet who hasn't told me that after seeing this film they didn't like one bit of it, everyone had something good to say about it! I duff my hat to the creators, the voice actors, the animators and the music department (plus anyone else who was a part of a team who made this film) of this film and thank them that they took their time, they changed things that needed to be changed and picked the right people for the jobs intended. Honestly I can't think of any changes that I could make to this film to make it better!

451,10,"Unable to control her powers, Elsa unleashes an eternal winter over the land of Arendelle. It is up to her sister, Princess Anna, to find a way to break the spell. Young and longing for romance, Anna falls swiftly in love with Prince Hans and places him in charge of Arendelle while she goes in search of Elsa, who has escaped to the North Mountain. Along the way, Anna is joined by Kristoff, an ice-seller whose business is threatened by the weather, and the adorable snowman Olaf. But Elsa is in her element and doesn't want to return. Enraged and frightened, she accidentally causes ice to enter Anna's heart, which can only be cured by an act of true love. This is where things take an interesting turn; we still get the happy Disney ending, but not in a way that we expect.I love how there was a double twist at the end, which I suspect most viewers didn't see coming. The message was clear: first impressions, be they negative or positive, can turn out to be wrong. It was this that set Frozen apart from nearly all the other Disney films, where the lines between good and bad are drawn clearly from the outset. I also like how Elsa, who brought about this state of affairs, was not truly a villain but a victim of her own powers. Olaf the snowman was a touch of comic genius. The soundtrack was absolutely wonderful - lovely music and highly apt lyrics.

452,10,"Let me just say it - I loved ""Frozen""! It takes me back to the 1990's golden age of Disney, and I think the quality of this one is just way up there right alongside titles like ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", ""The Lion King"" and ""Pocahontas"" from that period. I feel like Disney may have hit a new stride with three out of the latest four tiles *(""The Princess and the Frog"", ""Tangled"" and now ""Frozen"") in the same league as those movies. I think that with ""Frozen"" Disney have once again demonstrated why they are still 76 years after ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" undeniably the number one cartoon and animation studio in the World - with only Studio Ghilbi giving real competition. The story, while loosely build on the story ""The Snow Queen"" by Hans Christian Andersen, is very inventive and contemporary. The main characters present a variation and though some are fun and likable they are not all that obvious. At the same time the sidekicks are very good and very funny and they work very well in the story without ever taking too much of the focus.Some people have complained about the music and the singing. I love it. I must say that I feel this music and the songs are on the same level as in ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" and I think it is both very, very nice and quite honestly high time that Disney returned to the animated musicals that were so very successful in the 1990's, and with ""Frozen"" I think they did just that and they did it very, very well.I am very much looking forward and hoping to see more Disney releases like this in the (near) future.

453,10,"Not since 'the big four' have Disney ever been so on top form. Their previous entries (Wreck-it Ralph, Tangled, etc.) were all good but, for me, never reached greatness. 'Frozen' is a genuinely funny and charming movie with fantastic songs and a wonderful message.Inspired (very) loosely by Hans Christian Andersen's story, 'The Snow Queen', Frozen tells the story of two sisters, Anna and Elsa, who lose their bond over the years. At Elsa's coronation of Queen, her magical ice powers are inadvertently unleashed. Fleeing in fear, she unknowingly sets off an eternal winter, covering the city of Arendelle in snow. Anna takes it upon herself to reunite with her sister, reconcile and put an end to the curse. But it proves problematic for several reasons.It might sound a little been there, done that, but Disney turns their own clichés on their head. I was surprised by an outcome several times during this movie - something that I can't honestly say about a Disney film since the 90's.I literally can't fault it. The animation is flawless, every detail is impeccable whether it be a strand of hair on a character's face or one of the countless snowflakes seen during the film. Stylistically, it's the same as 'Tangled', but here the imagery is much more striking.Princess Anna and Queen Elsa are voiced respectively by Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel. I'd never heard Bell sing before this, but her singing voice is beautiful. And as for Menzel, once again, she is on top form. I have heard her sing in 'Wicked', 'Glee', 'Rent' and more, yet her voice is still stunning and continues to surprise me. No less for a woman in her 40's.Frozen has that magic spark that's been missing from most Disney movies for so long and much, more more. It is guaranteed to delight children and adults alike and thaw even the coldest of hearts. I'm not ashamed to call it a future masterpiece and I believe it will set a new standard for Disney the same way 'The Lion King' did 20 years before it.A perfect 10/10. Bravo, Disney.

454,10,"No spoilers here----------I have never been one to throw 5 cent buzzwords around when explaining or describing things. I try to stay away from awesome, beautiful, masterful and glorious when it comes to movies because after all they are just movies. That being said: Frozen is awesome, beautiful, masterful and glorious I am actually a pretty cynical guy, I have been moved by movies in the past usually sports related titles. But I usually see them for what they are, just entertainment. Frozen is much more than that to me and since a review is usually personal that's where this one has taken me. I have heard of people being so into a piece of artwork that they can't stop thinking about it possibly even becoming obsessed about it. That may be where I am with this movie.Frozen stars Kristen Bell (also stared as Veronica Mars) who provides the voice for Anna. Anna is a fearless, optimist but also a lonely young girl who wants nothing more than to connect with another real live person. Her sister Elsa voiced by the amazing Idina Menzel (known for Broadway hits Wicked & Rent). Elsa is perhaps the most complicated of all Disney Princess to date. She is elegant, soulful and graceful but hides a deep dark secret a curse that will show itself early on in the movie.The twists and turns that the Disney storytellers take us on in this movie are brilliant. They provide something for everyone; action, suspense, romance, and just the right amount of cute (Olaf and Sven). After all it was Disney who taught us a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. The medicine in this case is one of the most emotional performances you will ever see. Without giving away major spoilers I will simply say there were a couple of moments when there is an actual audible gasp heard in the audience.The first time I saw Frozen I spent the first 15 minutes thinking great; They are going to sing to me the whole movie this may be a long 2 hours. By the end of the first act I was ready to jump out of your seat and scream encore! Idina Menzel brings the house down with her version of ""Let it Go"". It was such a great scene I find myself watching it over and over and still get chills. When I went back for all repeat viewings I appreciated the first 15 minutes much more and even fell in love with that music too. I feel the pain these characters feel so much more after getting to know them the first time.Some of the other reviews seem to concentrate negatively on the CGI animation complaining about it not being a hand drawn movie. They are entitled to their opinions but honestly could the visual effects that this movie provides have ever been created using had drawn mappings? We needed the technology to see it this way and I don't care how it was animated when the final product is this stunning.This movie is an instant classic and I am confident that my great grandkids will be showing it to their kids many years from now and still enjoying this timeless instant classic. I can't give away anything so I will leave this as my official review tag line: Frozen is a beautiful work of art set to amazing music with a powerful story. That being said I give Frozen, a solid 10 out of 10.

The two female characters, Anna and Elsa, continue the trend of strong independent Disney heroines, which started in the Disney Renaissance. I also liked how the relationship between the lead male and female developed over time. That proves to be an important part of the story towards the end. I also found the movie visually stunning. The kingdom, mountains, and ice castle are gorgeous to look at.

459,8,"Frozen is one of those animated movies that delights adults, small children and every age in between. I don't know what the secret is, but my niece was a fan of the movie and of the characters when she was 2y.o.a., Frozen being the only movie she was able to sit in front of, from beginning to end, without getting up or getting bored. Frozen has had the same effect on children all over the world. There are many reasons why this move has been able to enchant adults and children alike: 1/ This is a version of the traditional folk-tale of the Winter Witch. It doesn't matter that the story has been significantly modified, the mythological elements live in the psyche of all us, humans, and when they are matched outside, magic happens. Ask Joseph Campbell. 2/ The movie has a good combination of comedy, drama, romance, adventure, archetypal characters, and some funny 'pets' we all love straight-away. 3/ We all want to believe in magic, and there is plenty in this movie. 4/ The animation is excellent. 5/ The movie is very entertaining but it also has substance. As an adult viewer, the narrative, the quality of the soundtrack and the character composition are the main things for me not to get bored or disinterested. Frozen pleased me on all of those fronts. I thought that this was a very un-Disney Disney movie, or said differently, old-style fab Disney not the more commercial Disney of the last 25 years. One of the things I loved the most in Frozen was the update of both the male and female archetypes, both finally brought to the 21st century. The crappola of other Disney female characters was wed-out, so this is a movie with strong, independent, stubborn clever women, who are also human beings, imperfect and able to learn from their mistakes. The figure of the prince is also updated, a prince perhaps doesn't have a crown or a title, or is not even Mr Perfect, it is a good-hearted man who cares for his lady. Frozen is one for the first truly modern Disney movies. It shows that Disney is able, when they want, to produce outstanding memorable films as those I grew up with. For that to happen they have to stop considering children idiots. I found that impression confirmed when I watched Zootopia, also a great animated film. Overall, Frozen is great.","['frozen', 'one', 'animate', 'movie', 'delight', 'adult', 'small', 'child', 'every', 'age', 'know', 'secret', 'niece', 'fan', 'movie', 'character', 'frozen', 'movie', 'able', 'sit', 'front', 'begin', 'end', 'without', 'get', 'get', 'bore', 'frozen', 'effect', 'child', 'world', 'many', 'reason', 'move', 'able', 'enchant', 'adult', 'child', 'alike', 'version', 'traditional', 'folk', 'tale', 'winter', 'witch', 'matter', 'story', 'significantly', 'modify', 'mythological', 'element', 'live', 'psyche', 'u', 'human', 'match', 'outside', 'magic', 'happens', 'ask', 'joseph', 'campbell', 'movie', 'good', 'combination', 'comedy', 'drama', 'romance', 'adventure', 'archetypal', 'character', 'funny', 'pet', 'love', 'straight', 'away', 'want', 'believe', 'magic', 'plenty', 'movie', 'animation', 'excellent', 'movie', 'entertain', 'also', 'substance', 'adult', 'viewer', 'narrative', 'quality', 'soundtrack', 'character', 'composition', 'main', 'thing', 'get', 'bore', 'disinterested', 'frozen', 'pleased', 'front', 'thought', 'un', 'disney', 'disney', 'movie', 'say', 'differently', 'old', 'style', 'fab', 'disney', 'commercial', 'disney', 'last', 'year', 'one', 'thing', 'love', 'frozen', 'update', 'male', 'female', 'archetype', 'finally', 'brought', 'st', 'century', 'crappola', 'disney', 'female', 'character', 'wed', 'movie', 'strong', 'independent', 'stubborn', 'clever', 'woman', 'also', 'human', 'imperfect', 'able', 'learn', 'mistake', 'figure', 'prince', 'also', 'update', 'prince', 'perhaps', 'crown', 'title', 'even', 'mr', 'perfect', 'good', 'hearted', 'man', 'care', 'lady', 'frozen', 'one', 'first', 'truly', 'modern', 'disney', 'movie', 'show', 'disney', 'able', 'want', 'produce', 'outstanding', 'memorable', 'film', 'grow', 'happen', 'stop', 'consider', 'child', 'idiot', 'found', 'impression', 'confirm', 'watch', 'zootopia', 'also', 'great', 'animate', 'film', 'overall', 'frozen', 'great']","[5, 10, 38, 1, 1062, 147, 601, 70, 115, 139, 56, 508, 1340, 176, 1, 8, 5, 1, 294, 708, 938, 160, 41, 137, 19, 19, 604, 5, 278, 70, 126, 61, 180, 242, 294, 615, 147, 70, 725, 435, 462, 1417, 114, 105, 1385, 375, 12, 4664, 401, 224, 2830, 177, 515, 553, 769, 150, 591, 581, 1, 17, 1414, 279, 745, 363, 326, 4665, 8, 85, 983, 6, 984, 101, 59, 220, 150, 727, 1, 21, 298, 1, 243, 27, 1722, 147, 479, 802, 283, 225, 8, 2524, 119, 43, 19, 604, 4666, 5, 1515, 938, 92, 2766, 2, 2, 1, 35, 2155, 64, 355, 4271, 2, 1520, 2, 197, 47, 10, 43, 6, 5, 2482, 431, 237, 2417, 241, 599, 1405, 1248, 2, 237, 8, 2822, 1, 167, 1058, 2751, 691, 251, 27, 515, 4667, 294, 347, 967, 630, 82, 27, 2482, 82, 578, 722, 590, 28, 2500, 175, 17, 1329, 145, 293, 1599, 5, 10, 36, 329, 324, 2, 1, 78, 2, 294, 59, 587, 764, 268, 3, 285, 290, 284, 421, 70, 2022, 231, 1118, 2711, 23, 3246, 27, 25, 38, 3, 166, 5, 25]"

461,8,"This Disney musical is fun. Flat-out fun. The humor was great and the visuals continue to stun. And it looks like Disney is finally starting to learn how to use 3-d animation to their advantage (another great example of this is 2012's Wreck it Ralph). A good way to describe this film is that it's self-aware. It knew it was treading some similar Disney cliques, and it just had fun with its silly moments.

464,8,"It's hard to deny the worldwide phenomenon that is this movie. While I'm sure parents now twitch any time ""Let it Go"" comes on, the fact of the matter is many factors led to the success of this film. Starting in the mid-2000's, Disney saw they had a problem and set about trying to fix it. By rehauling how they told stories, and how they approached the characters in these stories, they soon were back on top of the animation industry (while Pixar continues to be content pumping out Cars sequels).Stunning visuals can only get you so far in a Disney movie, and Frozen (2013) certainly takes the cake when it comes to visualizing snow and ice through computers. What makes Frozen work as a story is its complexity. No one character is completely good or completely bad, each having their faults and limitations, as well as their good intentions and personal desires. This makes identifying the villain a little bit like it is in real life: is it Elsa, who accidentally turned the weather to winter and is fighting to maintain her freeing isolation? Or is it Hans, who probably has a disadvantage at home and just wants to bring his leadership to his kingdom? Either way, the moral of ""sacrificial love"" is one that breaks from the standard ""fairy tale"" storyline.I think what sets Frozen apart is its music. Sure, most Disney films are considered ""musical,"" but it's the Broadway-esque styling of the songs that makes them so memorable. And while the songs are heavily weighted to the first half of the movie, the certainly run the gamut of emotions. From sappy love songs to a goofy snowman aria to the ballad of an independent woman, almost every character gets their say through song. Still, Disney missed a few opportunities to incorporate Foreigner songs into the soundtrack (i.e. ""Cold as Ice"" and ""I Wanna Know What Love is"").A fantastic movie, when compared to other animated films, I give Frozen 4.0 stars out of 5.","['hard', 'deny', 'worldwide', 'phenomenon', 'movie', 'sure', 'parent', 'twitch', 'time', 'let', 'go', 'come', 'fact', 'matter', 'many', 'factor', 'lead', 'success', 'film', 'start', 'mid', 'disney', 'saw', 'problem', 'set', 'try', 'fix', 'rehauling', 'told', 'story', 'approach', 'character', 'story', 'soon', 'back', 'top', 'animation', 'industry', 'pixar', 'continue', 'content', 'pump', 'car', 'sequel', 'stun', 'visuals', 'get', 'far', 'disney', 'movie', 'frozen', 'certainly', 'take', 'cake', 'come', 'visualize', 'snow', 'ice', 'computer', 'make', 'frozen', 'work', 'story', 'complexity', 'one', 'character', 'completely', 'good', 'completely', 'bad', 'fault', 'limitation', 'well', 'good', 'intention', 'personal', 'desire', 'make', 'identify', 'villain', 'little', 'bit', 'like', 'real', 'life', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'turn', 'weather', 'winter', 'fight', 'maintain', 'free', 'isolation', 'han', 'probably', 'disadvantage', 'home', 'want', 'bring', 'leadership', 'kingdom', 'either', 'way', 'moral', 'sacrificial', 'love', 'one', 'break', 'standard', 'fairy', 'tale', 'storyline', 'think', 'set', 'frozen', 'apart', 'music', 'sure', 'disney', 'film', 'consider', 'musical', 'broadway', 'esque', 'style', 'song', 'make', 'memorable', 'song', 'heavily', 'weight', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'certainly', 'run', 'gamut', 'emotion', 'sappy', 'love', 'song', 'goofy', 'snowman', 'aria', 'ballad', 'independent', 'woman', 'almost', 'every', 'character', 'get', 'say', 'song', 'still', 'disney', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'incorporate', 'foreigner', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'e', 'cold', 'ice', 'wan', 'know', 'love', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'compare', 'animate', 'film', 'give', 'frozen', 'star']","[307, 1893, 1953, 1981, 1, 207, 118, 3774, 20, 30, 13, 40, 201, 375, 61, 945, 248, 577, 3, 120, 1835, 2, 157, 198, 144, 87, 1012, 511, 12, 1111, 8, 12, 580, 74, 239, 21, 2959, 194, 647, 1370, 1406, 561, 315, 267, 19, 142, 2, 1, 5, 442, 55, 3550, 40, 39, 33, 642, 14, 5, 107, 12, 1797, 10, 8, 291, 17, 291, 65, 1011, 2493, 18, 17, 1659, 537, 1070, 14, 2641, 104, 48, 95, 9, 195, 79, 4, 300, 113, 986, 105, 816, 2938, 593, 600, 44, 210, 533, 59, 221, 3247, 77, 353, 50, 551, 4668, 6, 10, 340, 633, 219, 114, 295, 37, 144, 5, 512, 58, 207, 2, 3, 421, 51, 411, 1906, 355, 11, 14, 268, 11, 2053, 2280, 36, 346, 1, 442, 233, 240, 2175, 6, 11, 961, 45, 1265, 1058, 251, 173, 115, 8, 19, 35, 11, 68, 2, 271, 759, 1750, 11, 225, 893, 366, 33, 779, 56, 6, 253, 1, 350, 38, 3, 57, 5, 249]"

467,8,"I avoided watching Disney's Frozen for a long time, no lie. I hate overblown hype despise maniacal product placement, and unfortunately kid's movies suffer through the worst of it (remember Tangled? Ugh). I did finally get around to seeing it though, and it's an utter delight. A little thin in the plot department, mind you, but that's where the Disney wizards compensate with stunning visuals, effervescent voice acting and of course that legendary, now iconic song, belted out by Idina Menzel's Elsa high atop a snowy peak. I heard that song played into oblivion before I ever saw the film, and didn't ever think I'd be able to enjoy it again without getting the ol' eyelid twitch, but seeing the real thing in the context of the film, with a little help from my home theater system, well.... let it go indeed. Menzel and Kristen Bell are touching as the two sisters, Anna the doe eyed princess with the world at her feet, Elsa the fierce and independent rebel who doesn't fit in. Her magical abilities with snow and ice allow for some unbelievable computer effects, and the ice palace she creates is a gem of a set piece, intricately woven and detailed to the max. Their castle down below is designed with traditional Germanic decoration in mind, a nod to the inspiration they have no doubt received from Hans Christian Anderson's original storybook, The Snow Queen. Like I said before, what's there in plot is spread pretty thin, but it's no matter, because this one is fuelled by visuals. Sweeping mountains packed it powdery snow drifts, ornate castles, beautifully designed costumes, sleds, dresses and animals, including Sven the rambunctious reindeer. It's a jewel of ocular achievement. Oh and I might add, that Swedish sounding dude who runs the little shop way up the mountain is probably the funniest character Disney has created in years.","['avoid', 'watch', 'disney', 'frozen', 'long', 'time', 'lie', 'hate', 'overblown', 'hype', 'despise', 'maniacal', 'product', 'placement', 'unfortunately', 'kid', 'movie', 'suffer', 'bad', 'remember', 'tangle', 'ugh', 'finally', 'get', 'around', 'see', 'though', 'utter', 'delight', 'little', 'thin', 'plot', 'department', 'mind', 'disney', 'wizard', 'compensate', 'stun', 'visuals', 'effervescent', 'voice', 'act', 'course', 'legendary', 'iconic', 'song', 'belt', 'idina', 'menzel', 'elsa', 'high', 'atop', 'snowy', 'peak', 'heard', 'song', 'played', 'oblivion', 'ever', 'saw', 'film', 'ever', 'think', 'able', 'enjoy', 'without', 'get', 'ol', 'eyelid', 'twitch', 'see', 'real', 'thing', 'context', 'film', 'little', 'help', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'well', 'let', 'go', 'indeed', 'menzel', 'kristen', 'bell', 'touch', 'two', 'sister', 'anna', 'doe', 'eyed', 'princess', 'world', 'foot', 'elsa', 'fierce', 'independent', 'rebel', 'fit', 'magical', 'ability', 'snow', 'ice', 'allow', 'unbelievable', 'computer', 'effect', 'ice', 'palace', 'creates', 'gem', 'set', 'piece', 'intricately', 'woven', 'detailed', 'max', 'castle', 'design', 'traditional', 'germanic', 'decoration', 'mind', 'nod', 'inspiration', 'doubt', 'receive', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'original', 'storybook', 'snow', 'queen', 'like', 'say', 'plot', 'spread', 'pretty', 'thin', 'matter', 'one', 'fuel', 'visuals', 'sweep', 'mountain', 'packed', 'powdery', 'snow', 'drift', 'ornate', 'castle', 'beautifully', 'design', 'costume', 'sled', 'dress', 'animal', 'include', 'sven', 'rambunctious', 'reindeer', 'jewel', 'ocular', 'achievement', 'oh', 'might', 'add', 'swedish', 'sound', 'dude', 'run', 'little', 'shop', 'way', 'mountain', 'probably', 'funniest', 'character', 'disney', 'create', 'year']","[863, 23, 2, 5, 169, 20, 1152, 333, 4085, 406, 2709, 1060, 2694, 573, 60, 1, 888, 65, 391, 83, 2334, 241, 19, 200, 16, 100, 2963, 1062, 48, 1306, 52, 1755, 320, 2, 2282, 3140, 315, 267, 3709, 86, 112, 228, 2426, 1807, 11, 1276, 141, 116, 4, 206, 4671, 1218, 2375, 357, 11, 507, 4672, 81, 157, 3, 81, 37, 294, 91, 137, 19, 3774, 16, 195, 43, 1470, 3, 48, 135, 533, 312, 2229, 18, 30, 13, 826, 116, 162, 146, 260, 42, 15, 7, 3775, 1814, 29, 126, 1892, 4, 3507, 1058, 3656, 560, 170, 367, 39, 33, 833, 2128, 642, 278, 33, 383, 797, 3034, 144, 588, 3148, 1488, 168, 424, 462, 320, 2713, 1788, 681, 852, 44, 245, 467, 230, 4499, 39, 49, 9, 35, 52, 2367, 136, 1306, 375, 10, 3776, 267, 2083, 214, 1184, 4124, 39, 2395, 168, 529, 424, 1336, 2398, 907, 876, 349, 181, 3777, 151, 1748, 425, 252, 269, 3088, 259, 1578, 233, 48, 3476, 50, 214, 210, 1526, 8, 2, 134, 47]"

Also, she never complains to be ""second"" but stands to her dominating sister. Many positive characteristics. In my eyes, she's the real hero of the movie.Now let's look how children react on the two characters: The children I observed (girls from family and friends) definitely recognize Elsa as the main hero of the movie. They remember Elsa's name, but not Anna's. They sing Elsas songs, but not Anna's. The draw pictures of Elsa, but not Anna. I can only guess why: Likely because of Elsa's appearance. She much more looks like a princess or queen. Anna is dressed in a usual way, acts like a usual girl, nothing spectacular.It's a pity that pictures and characters are misaligned. There would have been such a good potential in the story to deliver the values of Anna to children. But the pictures talk differently and obfuscate the valuable message. And all after the fact explanations of parents don't help much here, as you likely know.So: Pictures move message off target.Technically, the movie if very good.

Step into the shoes of the cutting-edge sub-brand Pixar, whose BRAVE (2012, 8/10) heralds a trend whereby a female heroine can break the shackles of looking for male suitor as the one and only goal for life. FROZEN goes for a more ambitious yet crucial route to accentuate the courage of embracing yourself as who you are, no matter how different you are from the rest, shut down your heart and lock yourself up in an isolated kingdom is not a way out. Such a valuable message can be widely assimilated among viewers while the roots remain Disney-esque, tuneful and catchy musical numbers with routine delivery, prominent sidekicks fittingly align with the protagonists, like Olaf, the snowman naively thirsts for summer and sunlight, the contribution of Josh Gad's voice cannot go unnoticed. Veteran animator Chris Buck teams up with the first-time director Jennifer Lee, together they construe Hans Christian Andersen's popular fairytale (The Ice Queen) into a visually variegated adventure, minimize the cliché-ridden flourishes which commonly embellish the leitmotif (no redundant sub-plots to slow down the narrative pace). The story progresses in a wonted and linear approach, yet the whole journey is never in deficiency of enchantment, while the plot is fairly more twisty than Disney's usual fare, a key revelation against the grain can blindside audiences without a hitch. The voice-cast are enjoyable despite that Menzel's voice is overtly too old for Elsa, it is also a plucky move to cast an openly out actor (Groff) to dub the valiant reindeer rider as Anna's genuine soulmate and love-interest, along with the connotation for a more nondiscriminatory society extracted from the pith of its tale, FROZEN is a cinematic hero of our times, a film reaches a much broader demography and transcends its general raison d' être, it may indeed positively refine our world into a more civilized tier and it is no end of virtuous achievements!","['bravura', 'toasty', 'comeback', 'zenith', 'disneyland', 'frozen', 'freshly', 'best', 'animation', 'picture', 'crowner', 'academy', 'award', 'already', 'swept', 'globe', 'colossal', 'box', 'office', 'gross', 'ultra', 'appeal', 'theme', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'also', 'signal', 'first', 'time', 'beloved', 'animation', 'tentpole', 'lovey', 'dovey', 'boilerplate', 'princess', 'quest', 'prince', 'charm', 'preponderate', 'bond', 'princess', 'anna', 'sister', 'ice', 'queen', 'elsa', 'broad', 'wholesome', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'step', 'shoe', 'cut', 'edge', 'sub', 'brand', 'pixar', 'whose', 'brave', 'herald', 'trend', 'whereby', 'female', 'heroine', 'break', 'shackle', 'look', 'male', 'suitor', 'one', 'goal', 'life', 'frozen', 'go', 'ambitious', 'yet', 'crucial', 'route', 'accentuate', 'courage', 'embrace', 'matter', 'different', 'rest', 'shut', 'heart', 'lock', 'isolated', 'kingdom', 'way', 'valuable', 'message', 'widely', 'assimilate', 'among', 'viewer', 'root', 'remain', 'disney', 'esque', 'tuneful', 'catchy', 'musical', 'number', 'routine', 'delivery', 'prominent', 'sidekick', 'fittingly', 'align', 'protagonist', 'like', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'naively', 'thirst', 'summer', 'sunlight', 'contribution', 'josh', 'gad', 'voice', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'veteran', 'animator', 'chris', 'buck', 'team', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'together', 'construe', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'popular', 'fairytale', 'ice', 'queen', 'visually', 'variegate', 'adventure', 'minimize', 'clich', 'ridden', 'flourish', 'commonly', 'embellish', 'leitmotif', 'redundant', 'sub', 'plot', 'slow', 'narrative', 'pace', 'story', 'progress', 'wonted', 'linear', 'approach', 'yet', 'whole', 'journey', 'never', 'deficiency', 'enchantment', 'plot', 'fairly', 'twisty', 'disney', 'usual', 'fare', 'key', 'revelation', 'grain', 'blindside', 'audience', 'without', 'hitch', 'voice', 'cast', 'enjoyable', 'despite', 'menzel', 'voice', 'overtly', 'old', 'elsa', 'also', 'plucky', 'move', 'cast', 'openly', 'actor', 'groff', 'dub', 'valiant', 'reindeer', 'rider', 'anna', 'genuine', 'soulmate', 'love', 'interest', 'along', 'connotation', 'nondiscriminatory', 'society', 'extract', 'pith', 'tale', 'frozen', 'cinematic', 'hero', 'time', 'film', 'reach', 'much', 'broader', 'demography', 'transcends', 'general', 'raison', 'tre', 'may', 'indeed', 'positively', 'refine', 'world', 'civilize', 'tier', 'end', 'virtuous', 'achievement']","[2679, 3590, 5, 34, 21, 438, 856, 469, 397, 1521, 598, 717, 783, 2990, 484, 226, 11, 30, 13, 27, 36, 20, 1280, 21, 4341, 4342, 4675, 29, 1527, 82, 235, 482, 29, 7, 15, 33, 49, 4, 3781, 3429, 112, 62, 6, 668, 4676, 723, 1068, 2043, 1545, 194, 620, 335, 4677, 1678, 4164, 237, 565, 340, 4678, 66, 431, 3248, 10, 2525, 79, 5, 13, 2028, 182, 3249, 1650, 1689, 1221, 375, 140, 303, 686, 80, 382, 782, 77, 50, 1880, 185, 4583, 471, 479, 885, 1436, 2, 1906, 3782, 266, 51, 184, 2953, 2756, 2835, 436, 354, 9, 32, 45, 3783, 205, 275, 257, 86, 13, 4052, 3757, 812, 526, 490, 486, 36, 20, 770, 464, 416, 332, 44, 245, 339, 559, 756, 33, 49, 585, 326, 3784, 274, 4451, 3785, 4679, 2043, 52, 1065, 802, 564, 12, 1149, 4254, 1111, 182, 127, 337, 88, 3250, 52, 890, 2, 562, 1591, 1165, 1833, 4680, 159, 137, 3786, 86, 227, 306, 313, 116, 86, 64, 4, 27, 3162, 242, 227, 3765, 518, 377, 3251, 151, 3054, 7, 1342, 6, 122, 172, 943, 114, 5, 2921, 544, 20, 3, 1046, 31, 4681, 623, 171, 826, 2379, 4682, 126, 3230, 41, 1748]"

The story is nice, the animation is gorgeous, there is the standard comic relief characters (Olaf and Sven are very enjoyable) and there is a message to the whole thing... I hope because it is slightly beyond me what the message is. Face your fears? Love is the answer? Snowmen will melt in the sun? Maybe it was just below me.Either way it is enjoyable and funny film that is entertaining and has a bit of twist to it. Which is all nice. But it is an unimportant film with characters who adults at least should find it hard to related to as there is very little explanation or redeeming qualities to them. And the bad things they end up doing is just brushed off in the end. The songs are abysmal, trivial and really below the standard Disney set in the 90s for animated musicals. For all the things I didn't like about the film I can forgive all except the songs. Had they dropped the songs I could have enjoyed it far more. And it honestly feel like they knew this as the end 20-30 minutes feature no songs whatsoever. Did they just drop them? But this is me as an adult. Kids will love it for sure. All my points in the first part is still relevant. And kids will respond to this. And they might find the songs more appealing than me. And maybe not care too much about the character flaws. So do not avoid the film... just don't expect too much for adults to love about it.","['get', 'get', 'love', 'sure', 'get', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'nice', 'animation', 'gorgeous', 'standard', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'olaf', 'sven', 'enjoyable', 'message', 'whole', 'thing', 'hope', 'slightly', 'beyond', 'message', 'face', 'fear', 'love', 'answer', 'snowman', 'melt', 'sun', 'maybe', 'either', 'way', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'film', 'entertain', 'bit', 'twist', 'nice', 'unimportant', 'film', 'character', 'adult', 'least', 'find', 'hard', 'related', 'little', 'explanation', 'redeem', 'quality', 'bad', 'thing', 'end', 'brush', 'end', 'song', 'abysmal', 'trivial', 'really', 'standard', 'disney', 'set', 'animate', 'musical', 'thing', 'like', 'film', 'forgive', 'except', 'song', 'drop', 'song', 'could', 'enjoy', 'far', 'honestly', 'feel', 'like', 'knew', 'end', 'minute', 'feature', 'song', 'whatsoever', 'drop', 'adult', 'kid', 'love', 'sure', 'point', 'first', 'part', 'still', 'relevant', 'kid', 'respond', 'might', 'find', 'song', 'appeal', 'maybe', 'care', 'much', 'character', 'flaw', 'avoid', 'film', 'expect', 'much', 'adult', 'love']","[19, 19, 6, 207, 19, 31, 6, 12, 192, 21, 444, 633, 309, 297, 8, 32, 181, 306, 185, 127, 43, 384, 774, 614, 185, 381, 187, 6, 1145, 45, 359, 2383, 232, 353, 50, 306, 85, 3, 243, 95, 129, 192, 4683, 3, 8, 147, 250, 71, 307, 1312, 48, 806, 1199, 283, 65, 43, 41, 4112, 41, 11, 4684, 4685, 22, 633, 2, 144, 38, 51, 43, 9, 3, 1584, 474, 11, 1207, 11, 54, 91, 142, 542, 53, 9, 488, 41, 211, 229, 11, 1978, 1207, 147, 60, 6, 207, 117, 36, 94, 68, 1335, 60, 2914, 252, 71, 11, 484, 232, 293, 31, 8, 386, 863, 3, 131, 31, 147, 6]"

475,8,"""Winter's a good time to sit close and cuddle, but put me in summer and I'll be a happy snowman!""Frozen may not be among Disney's best animated films, but it sure is a warm and charming one. The animation was gorgeous and looked really beautiful, while some of the characters were quite fun and memorable (Im thinking mostly of Olaf the snowman here). It balances the classic fairytale elements from other Disney movies, while at the same time bringing in some surprising twists to the mix. The Disney princess formula may be old, but it continues to work and charm audiences over the world, and it doesn't hurt that Frozen adds some fresh elements to the known and bankable formula as well. Frozen relied heavily on several musical numbers like most of the classical Disney animated films did, so it also manages to have a nostalgic effect on those of us who grew up watching those movies. This is a fun and warm film that the entire family will enjoy. It's not perfect, it has some very cheesy moments and lacks a stronger villain, but it has plenty of heart and laughs to carry the film.Directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee and loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale, The Snow Queen, Frozen is a tale of two sisters, Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell), who grow up together in the palace of Arendelle. Elsa has a magical power which allows her to turn things into ice and snow. At first it's all fun and games, but when Elsa's power increases she cannot control it any longer and is forced to live secluded in her room. After an unfortunate accident Elsa brings an eternal winter to Arendelle and runs away from the palace ashamed for what she has caused. Elsa sets out on an adventure to bring her sister back with the help of a mountain man named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven. Along the way they encounter a friendly snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad) and together they face the cold weather as they search for Elsa in order to bring her back home, but Elsa fears her powers have become too dangerous and is afraid to return home.Lee happens to be the first female director of a Disney animated film, and she delivers by creating stronger female characters. Frozen becomes more than anything a story that centers on these two sisters and the bond between them. Fear gets in the way of their relationship and it's up to them to overcome it. They are strong characters that don't depend on a prince to come to their rescue. That is what makes this classic fairytale take a modern turn.

476,9,"This is a entertaining magical drama that is surely worth seeing. As a matter of fact I want to see it again. Despite it lacking very slightly in certain areas, like a bit more development would have been nice. But it has just about everything I wanted from a CGI animated drama. And when I say drama, it's fast-paced and enjoyable. I couldn't help, but feel drawn into this magical world. I usually don't really like musical scores in movies, but I was amused and entertained by just about all of it in this. The music in this, is just superb. I usually tend to respect or at least try to understand other reviewer's reviews. But just about all the super negative things said about this movie seemed to be very very very nitpicky. Despite few very very very nitpicky negative reviews, this movie is a treat. A emotionally touching treat, that melts with warm goodness. Plus it even has a good message to go with it. I am currently hooked on the musical score ""Let It Go"" by Indina Menzel, which is the movie's theme song.

477,7,"Apart from having a fast paced first and especially third act, Disney Animation's Frozen definitely captures its audience with stunning visuals, memorable music and a heart warming story. It definitely brings back the charm that has been well-known and expected from a Disney film. The voice performances of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, and the rest were absolutely spectacular in song and out. It is everything expected out of a Disney film and more. The only negatives are of course the fast paced first and third acts. I won't say much about the first only that it had a lot of background to cover, and not much time to do it in. The Third act is fast-paced and is noticeably faster than the second and at times may be a bit hard to follow.

478,9,"Frozen is a Disney animation, directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, and stars Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel and Jonathan Groff. Frozen centres around Anna, a princess whose sister has powers over ice that are unknown to the rest of the kingdom, until at her coronation to become Queen, her powers are revealed. Anna sets off to find her sister after the disaster, and help her fix her mistakes.Frozen is certainly one of the best Disney films in recent years. It's incredibly touching, funny, and brilliantly animated. Every single frame was a beauty to behold in the way of animation, and everything looked it's finest. All the characters are impeccably designed, and all of them have real qualities to them, something that has become rare in Disney princess animations.The film is a musical, which I fortunately knew about before entering the cinema. For my brother, this was a complete surprise. Despite his less than enthusiastic wonder for musicals, my brother, as well as myself, was incredibly impressed by the quality of the songs. Every one of them was sung to perfection, and we got a couple of sure to be Disney classics here. The already Golden Globe nominated song Let It Go, sung by Idina Menzel, is absolutely wonderful, and certainly deserves the nomination for best original song. I'm already humming the rhythms to at least 3 of the songs in the film, which is a testament to their brilliance. The score is also a wonderful aspect of the film. Christophe Beck is well known in the score world, and he delivers a fairly awesome score, that fits perfectly with the tone of the film. For the most part, it's very delicate, and it can be quite heroic at certain moments. In terms for a Disney princess film, this score is certainly one to marvel at, and I can see myself listening to this many times in the near future.All the voice actors give wonderful performances, and all are cast well, except for Idina Menzel, unfortunately. Whilst her singing voice is incredible and she gives a great performance, she didn't fit the role of Anna's sister Esla, a young, scared, innocent woman very well. Despite this, the rest of the cast does very well. Kristen Bell is perfectly cast as Anna, as is Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, and Santino Fontana as the true love of Anna, Hans. All in all, the cast does pretty damn well, in every individual role. Frozen does well not to turn itself into a typical Disney princess film, with unpredictable but reasonable plot points. Certain characters had sudden changes in motive that really did surprise me, something that is certainly a good thing. The film does have a few pacing problems, towards the beginning, in my opinion, though. The film progresses a little too quickly to begin with, as do certain characters relationships with each other. These problems are dealt with later on in the film, to my delight, so it's not too much of a problem. For the most part, Frozen is well paced, unpredictable and intelligent, which is a change from most of the recent animations we've been getting. In summary, Frozen is one of the best films of the year, by far. All cast members gives their best performances possible, the writing is wonderful, and the animators deserve awards for their great work. Whether you're bringing kids or not, you should love Frozen, despite it's minimal flaws. It's certainly broke into my top 10 of the year, that's for sure! 9.4/10","['frozen', 'disney', 'animation', 'direct', 'chris', 'buck', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'star', 'kristen', 'bell', 'idina', 'menzel', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'frozen', 'centre', 'around', 'anna', 'princess', 'whose', 'sister', 'power', 'ice', 'unknown', 'rest', 'kingdom', 'coronation', 'become', 'queen', 'power', 'reveal', 'anna', 'set', 'find', 'sister', 'disaster', 'help', 'fix', 'mistake', 'frozen', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'disney', 'film', 'recent', 'year', 'incredibly', 'touch', 'funny', 'brilliantly', 'animate', 'every', 'single', 'frame', 'beauty', 'behold', 'way', 'animation', 'everything', 'look', 'fine', 'character', 'impeccably', 'design', 'real', 'quality', 'something', 'become', 'rare', 'disney', 'princess', 'animation', 'film', 'musical', 'fortunately', 'knew', 'enter', 'cinema', 'brother', 'complete', 'surprise', 'despite', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'wonder', 'musical', 'brother', 'well', 'incredibly', 'impressed', 'quality', 'song', 'every', 'one', 'sung', 'perfection', 'get', 'couple', 'sure', 'disney', 'classic', 'already', 'golden', 'globe', 'nominate', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'sung', 'idina', 'menzel', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'certainly', 'deserves', 'nomination', 'best', 'original', 'song', 'already', 'hum', 'rhythm', 'least', 'song', 'film', 'testament', 'brilliance', 'score', 'also', 'wonderful', 'aspect', 'film', 'christophe', 'beck', 'well', 'know', 'score', 'world', 'delivers', 'fairly', 'awesome', 'score', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'film', 'part', 'delicate', 'quite', 'heroic', 'certain', 'moment', 'term', 'disney', 'princess', 'film', 'score', 'certainly', 'one', 'marvel', 'see', 'listen', 'many', 'time', 'near', 'future', 'voice', 'actor', 'give', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'cast', 'well', 'except', 'idina', 'menzel', 'unfortunately', 'whilst', 'sing', 'voice', 'incredible', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'fit', 'role', 'anna', 'sister', 'esla', 'young', 'scar', 'innocent', 'woman', 'well', 'despite', 'rest', 'cast', 'well', 'kristen', 'bell', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'anna', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'kristoff', 'santino', 'fontana', 'true', 'love', 'anna', 'han', 'cast', 'pretty', 'damn', 'well', 'every', 'individual', 'role', 'frozen', 'well', 'turn', 'typical', 'disney', 'princess', 'film', 'unpredictable', 'reasonable', 'plot', 'point', 'certain', 'character', 'sudden', 'change', 'motive', 'really', 'surprise', 'something', 'certainly', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'pace', 'problem', 'towards', 'begin', 'opinion', 'though', 'film', 'progress', 'little', 'quickly', 'begin', 'certain', 'character', 'relationship', 'problem', 'dealt', 'later', 'film', 'delight', 'much', 'problem', 'part', 'frozen', 'well', 'pace', 'unpredictable', 'intelligent', 'change', 'recent', 'animation', 'get', 'summary', 'frozen', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'far', 'cast', 'member', 'give', 'best', 'performance', 'possible', 'write', 'wonderful', 'animator', 'deserve', 'award', 'great', 'work', 'whether', 'bring', 'kid', 'love', 'frozen', 'despite', 'minimal', 'flaw', 'certainly', 'broke', 'top', 'year', 'sure']","[5, 2, 21, 721, 526, 490, 464, 416, 249, 162, 146, 141, 116, 455, 377, 5, 2187, 200, 7, 29, 620, 15, 24, 33, 3233, 303, 77, 343, 179, 49, 24, 528, 7, 144, 71, 15, 1783, 135, 1012, 967, 5, 442, 10, 34, 2, 3, 399, 47, 603, 260, 85, 1849, 38, 115, 741, 1918, 149, 2052, 50, 21, 132, 66, 470, 8, 3789, 424, 195, 283, 89, 179, 1308, 2, 29, 21, 3, 51, 2192, 488, 1683, 543, 865, 656, 445, 313, 321, 2839, 532, 51, 865, 18, 603, 947, 283, 11, 115, 10, 684, 1642, 19, 398, 207, 2, 69, 397, 796, 1521, 1463, 11, 30, 13, 684, 141, 116, 292, 215, 442, 592, 1469, 34, 230, 11, 397, 1048, 2526, 250, 11, 3, 3535, 2014, 223, 27, 215, 443, 3, 1357, 1307, 18, 56, 223, 126, 1143, 890, 338, 223, 560, 456, 627, 3, 94, 3145, 124, 2812, 563, 133, 657, 2, 29, 3, 223, 442, 10, 1448, 16, 531, 61, 20, 449, 607, 86, 518, 57, 215, 493, 227, 18, 474, 141, 116, 573, 1130, 63, 86, 549, 57, 25, 493, 560, 371, 7, 15, 4091, 73, 878, 1315, 251, 18, 313, 303, 227, 18, 162, 146, 456, 227, 7, 455, 377, 67, 688, 665, 62, 6, 7, 44, 227, 136, 1480, 18, 115, 1921, 371, 5, 18, 113, 376, 2, 29, 3, 1904, 2188, 52, 117, 563, 8, 1072, 209, 3252, 22, 445, 89, 442, 17, 43, 3, 564, 198, 538, 160, 258, 100, 3, 1149, 48, 733, 160, 563, 8, 153, 198, 358, 3, 1062, 31, 198, 94, 5, 18, 564, 1904, 2126, 209, 399, 21, 19, 1432, 5, 10, 34, 3, 47, 142, 227, 1212, 57, 34, 493, 673, 165, 215, 812, 483, 469, 25, 107, 638, 221, 60, 6, 5, 313, 1939, 386, 442, 1802, 239, 47, 207]"

480,9,"FROZEN is the new ""broadway' musical now as a Disney presentation in spectacular 3D CGI gloss. If this is the new way to get musicals back on movie screens then I am all for it. FROZEN is visually breathtaking and very very funny, with a great script and overwhelming visual scenes, one after the other. FROZEN is also a very clever and throughly elaborate way to ensure kids get to enjoy musical theater and fairytale delight as new movie cineplex fun. Most kids movies present such goony characters and lame product placement cynicism but FROZEN is pitched as clearly in tone and style as a $150 ticket stage show on 44th street NY. Everyone in the cinema today relished every part of the film and when the snowman showstopper musical sequence finished (""What'd I do in Summer""), there was enthusiastic applause. Possibly over-all 10 minutes too long and with two songs early on too many FROZEN visually is a sensation and astonishing in key scenes. I can see the stage show coming in 5 years time. But do not hesitate now to take kids of all ages and make this the 3D animated musical you decide to spend the extra dollars on. The male characters work in context and equally match the spunky young princess fruitiness. However, it's Olaf the snowman who steals the show and with what might be an Oscar winning song, one Oscar of about 6 that I expect to see FROZEN win. If FROZEN is now a Disney 'formula' for quality family musicals then they have got it right. And whatever you do do NOT come late, there is a screamingly funny cartoon ahead of the feature called GET A HORSE which combines hologram and 3D.","['frozen', 'new', 'broadway', 'musical', 'disney', 'presentation', 'spectacular', 'cgi', 'gloss', 'new', 'way', 'get', 'musical', 'back', 'movie', 'screen', 'frozen', 'visually', 'breathtaking', 'funny', 'great', 'script', 'overwhelm', 'visual', 'scene', 'one', 'frozen', 'also', 'clever', 'throughly', 'elaborate', 'way', 'ensure', 'kid', 'get', 'enjoy', 'musical', 'theater', 'fairytale', 'delight', 'new', 'movie', 'cineplex', 'fun', 'kid', 'movie', 'present', 'goony', 'character', 'lame', 'product', 'placement', 'cynicism', 'frozen', 'pitch', 'clearly', 'tone', 'style', 'ticket', 'stage', 'show', 'th', 'street', 'ny', 'everyone', 'cinema', 'today', 'relish', 'every', 'part', 'film', 'snowman', 'showstopper', 'musical', 'sequence', 'finish', 'summer', 'enthusiastic', 'applause', 'possibly', 'minute', 'long', 'two', 'song', 'early', 'many', 'frozen', 'visually', 'sensation', 'astonish', 'key', 'scene', 'see', 'stage', 'show', 'come', 'year', 'time', 'hesitate', 'take', 'kid', 'age', 'make', 'animate', 'musical', 'decide', 'spend', 'extra', 'dollar', 'male', 'character', 'work', 'context', 'equally', 'match', 'spunky', 'young', 'princess', 'fruitiness', 'however', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'steal', 'show', 'might', 'oscar', 'win', 'song', 'one', 'oscar', 'expect', 'see', 'frozen', 'win', 'frozen', 'disney', 'formula', 'quality', 'family', 'musical', 'get', 'right', 'whatever', 'come', 'late', 'screamingly', 'funny', 'cartoon', 'ahead', 'feature', 'call', 'get', 'horse', 'combine', 'hologram']","[5, 108, 411, 51, 2, 2852, 671, 555, 2683, 108, 50, 19, 51, 74, 1, 369, 5, 585, 905, 85, 25, 395, 2587, 450, 90, 10, 5, 27, 691, 4687, 1862, 50, 2838, 60, 19, 91, 51, 312, 756, 1062, 108, 1, 125, 60, 1, 663, 8, 1344, 1060, 2694, 4688, 5, 2024, 690, 627, 355, 2070, 1115, 78, 1210, 3253, 4433, 109, 543, 674, 115, 94, 3, 45, 4393, 51, 502, 855, 205, 2839, 3400, 842, 211, 169, 42, 11, 594, 61, 5, 585, 3065, 1811, 1165, 90, 16, 1115, 78, 40, 47, 20, 3254, 55, 60, 139, 14, 38, 51, 491, 1031, 1237, 1446, 431, 8, 107, 1470, 1169, 553, 1909, 73, 29, 110, 32, 45, 906, 78, 252, 302, 374, 11, 10, 302, 131, 16, 5, 374, 5, 2, 534, 283, 72, 51, 19, 130, 653, 40, 530, 85, 314, 1270, 229, 308, 19, 1015, 1096]"
481,8,"No matter what people say about Walt Disney Studio and its production, it is obvious they are the best in everything they do, especially it is refers to the animation. And Frozen is an excellent demonstration to that. Frozen is one of those animated movies that can be attached to the specific season and that leave nobody indifferent after their viewing. In this case Frozen can be seen as a Christmas movie because the story takes place in winter (I don't think this animation would be that popular in summer or autumn), and winter, as we know, is usually associated with Christmas time. Moreover, while watching it you have this feeling of Christmas miracle that something good is about to happen, there is some kind of hope for the better, let's say.The plot of this movie is not that complex. There are two sisters: Elsa, elder sister gifted with icy powers, and Anna, younger sister but with no magic powers. Elsa tries to hide her magic abilities not only from other people, but mostly from her sister because when the girls were children, Elsa almost killed Anna with her powers. But Elsa's attempts to keep her secret safe fail after all. And in order not to hurt anyone she runs away and creates her own icy kingdom. But she even doesn't suspect that when she left her native city where it was summer suddenly becomes covered by snow and icy and it's getting colder and colder there. Anna thinks it is her fault that Elsa revealed her secret and she also believes the only way to stop the winter is to get back Elsa. So, Anna goes in search of her elder sister. During her adventure she meets her real love, rude mountain guy Kristoff who was raised by trolls and whose best friend is a funny reindeer Sven. Later they meet Olaf, snowman created by Elsa. All together they try to find Elsa and stop the winter.Of course, there are some obstacles on their way that they must overcome to achieve their goal. Some of those trials are funny, even hilarious, but some of them are dramatic. I guess the most memorable moment is when Anna meets Kristoff. They don't get on well at first, there are some disputes between then, but then things turn different. Besides, all along the story there are lots of hilarious situations where Olaf is involved. I guess he and his future friend Sven lessen a bit the tension that from time to time appears in the movie. In my opinion, without them the movie wouldn't be that interesting and enjoyable.Like any other movie Frozen also has some points that I didn't like. The main of them is that there are too many songs performed by the main characters. Sometimes I even thought that it was a musical.Another interesting moment is that while I was watching this movie, I remembered a Danish animated movie called Snow Queen by G.H. Anderson that has practically similar story line. There are two kids – Kai and Gerda. One day Kai was kidnapped by Snow Queen and Gerda went in search of her friend who by that time became frozen. Gerda also had to overcome a lot of difficulties in order to find Kai. But she did it. I can say that the red line of both movies is that real love, hope and faith will help to overcome any life obstacles and will save the world from becoming frozen.So, in general Frozen is a great movie that has a nice story. If one of the winter evenings you want to relax and see cute characters, so go and watch Frozen. I guarantee you will enjoy it!","['matter', 'people', 'say', 'walt', 'disney', 'studio', 'production', 'obvious', 'best', 'everything', 'especially', 'refers', 'animation', 'frozen', 'excellent', 'demonstration', 'frozen', 'one', 'animate', 'movie', 'attach', 'specific', 'season', 'leave', 'nobody', 'indifferent', 'view', 'case', 'frozen', 'see', 'christmas', 'movie', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'winter', 'think', 'animation', 'would', 'popular', 'summer', 'autumn', 'winter', 'know', 'usually', 'associate', 'christmas', 'time', 'moreover', 'watch', 'feel', 'christmas', 'miracle', 'something', 'good', 'happen', 'kind', 'hope', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'plot', 'movie', 'complex', 'two', 'sister', 'elsa', 'elder', 'sister', 'gift', 'icy', 'power', 'anna', 'young', 'sister', 'magic', 'power', 'elsa', 'try', 'hide', 'magic', 'ability', 'people', 'mostly', 'sister', 'girl', 'child', 'elsa', 'almost', 'kill', 'anna', 'power', 'elsa', 'attempt', 'keep', 'secret', 'safe', 'fail', 'order', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'run', 'away', 'creates', 'icy', 'kingdom', 'even', 'suspect', 'left', 'native', 'city', 'summer', 'suddenly', 'becomes', 'cover', 'snow', 'icy', 'get', 'colder', 'colder', 'anna', 'think', 'fault', 'elsa', 'reveal', 'secret', 'also', 'believe', 'way', 'stop', 'winter', 'get', 'back', 'elsa', 'anna', 'go', 'search', 'elder', 'sister', 'adventure', 'meet', 'real', 'love', 'rude', 'mountain', 'guy', 'kristoff', 'raise', 'troll', 'whose', 'best', 'friend', 'funny', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'later', 'meet', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'create', 'elsa', 'together', 'try', 'find', 'elsa', 'stop', 'winter', 'course', 'obstacle', 'way', 'must', 'overcome', 'achieve', 'goal', 'trial', 'funny', 'even', 'hilarious', 'dramatic', 'guess', 'memorable', 'moment', 'anna', 'meet', 'kristoff', 'get', 'well', 'first', 'dispute', 'thing', 'turn', 'different', 'besides', 'along', 'story', 'lot', 'hilarious', 'situation', 'olaf', 'involve', 'guess', 'future', 'friend', 'sven', 'lessen', 'bit', 'tension', 'time', 'time', 'appear', 'movie', 'opinion', 'without', 'movie', 'interest', 'enjoyable', 'like', 'movie', 'frozen', 'also', 'point', 'like', 'main', 'many', 'song', 'perform', 'main', 'character', 'sometimes', 'even', 'thought', 'musical', 'another', 'interest', 'moment', 'watch', 'movie', 'remember', 'danish', 'animate', 'movie', 'call', 'snow', 'queen', 'g', 'h', 'anderson', 'practically', 'similar', 'story', 'line', 'two', 'kid', 'kai', 'gerda', 'one', 'day', 'kai', 'kidnap', 'snow', 'queen', 'gerda', 'go', 'search', 'friend', 'time', 'become', 'frozen', 'gerda', 'also', 'overcome', 'lot', 'difficulty', 'order', 'find', 'kai', 'say', 'red', 'line', 'movie', 'real', 'love', 'hope', 'faith', 'help', 'overcome', 'life', 'obstacle', 'save', 'world', 'become', 'frozen', 'general', 'frozen', 'great', 'movie', 'nice', 'story', 'one', 'winter', 'evening', 'want', 'relax', 'see', 'cute', 'character', 'go', 'watch', 'frozen', 'guarantee', 'enjoy']","[375, 46, 35, 410, 2, 311, 700, 595, 34, 132, 121, 4689, 21, 5, 298, 5, 10, 38, 1, 1764, 1586, 1040, 322, 1170, 4690, 413, 514, 5, 16, 743, 1, 12, 55, 188, 105, 37, 21, 26, 559, 205, 105, 56, 460, 2793, 743, 20, 2091, 23, 53, 743, 2183, 89, 17, 290, 193, 384, 18, 30, 35, 52, 1, 771, 42, 15, 4, 1139, 15, 832, 453, 24, 7, 73, 15, 150, 24, 4, 87, 676, 150, 367, 46, 567, 15, 76, 70, 4, 173, 286, 7, 24, 4, 448, 154, 508, 1174, 1166, 496, 305, 299, 233, 101, 797, 453, 77, 28, 1845, 330, 3374, 1389, 205, 1033, 380, 712, 39, 453, 19, 2759, 2759, 7, 37, 1011, 4, 528, 508, 27, 220, 50, 284, 105, 19, 74, 4, 7, 13, 793, 1139, 15, 326, 244, 195, 6, 2498, 214, 148, 67, 760, 123, 620, 34, 327, 85, 151, 181, 358, 244, 32, 45, 134, 4, 332, 87, 71, 4, 284, 105, 228, 2094, 50, 236, 1009, 1531, 2525, 3580, 85, 28, 364, 1213, 388, 268, 133, 7, 244, 67, 19, 18, 36, 4691, 43, 113, 140, 877, 172, 12, 84, 364, 867, 32, 584, 388, 607, 327, 181, 95, 1214, 20, 20, 582, 1, 258, 137, 1, 122, 306, 9, 1, 5, 27, 117, 9, 119, 61, 11, 1332, 119, 8, 504, 28, 92, 51, 102, 122, 133, 23, 1, 391, 2487, 38, 1, 308, 39, 49, 1986, 2051, 467, 1349, 446, 12, 213, 42, 60, 1940, 1816, 10, 138, 1940, 3790, 39, 49, 1816, 13, 793, 327, 20, 179, 5, 1816, 27, 1009, 84, 2321, 496, 71, 1940, 35, 1564, 213, 1, 195, 6, 384, 2249, 135, 1009, 79, 2094, 111, 126, 179, 5, 623, 5, 25, 1, 192, 12, 10, 105, 59, 2252, 16, 265, 8, 13, 23, 5, 3255, 91]"
482,9,"Like vintage mythical animations of Disney had done, Frozen will gift a fond memory for audience long after they leave the cinema. It's filled with stuffs childhood memory is made of; lovable characters, witty humor, great soundtracks and pleasant graphic. A few 3D animations have seen success with the newer technology, but Frozen tops them all with near magical feel which is almost forgotten in recent years. This is one movie that everyone, despite age and preference, can universally enjoy.The art has certain Disney aesthetic look; it's the best fusion of the old 2D nuance in 3D setting they've created so far. Games and other movies have superior graphic prowess, but there's something subtly captivating about Frozen's art direction. With plenty purplish azure dye in the transparent ice and quite elaborate designs in its detail, it's easy to appreciate the soft yet intricate wintery nature. The use of 3D effect helps the surreal environment, as the movie progresses the visual adapts to its tricky details, such as the falling snow, into astute part of the story. Its ice castle and vast snowy plain give feeling of majesty and also a hint of loneliness.Characters are simply lovable. Anna, the younger princess, is seriously lacking grace, but her brash and naive demeanor will surely captivate audience. She's downright adorable; it's a near impossible feat not to cheer for her. Elsa, the older one, is more mature and restricted. Her character has the most self-doubt and sadness; in a way the movie is about finding one self and acceptance from others, two things that might not go hand in hand, Elsa embodies the struggle perfectly. It's not often there are two princesses involved, however they have their own expressive personalities and their sisterhood bond is an uncanny delight.Kristoff as the rugged stud provides some chuckles and rather odd pauper prince role. He appears to have the most common sense and it's pretty funny to see him interact with odder characters. Sven, the reindeer, and Olaf, the magical little snow man, have plenty of humor amongst them. Disney always has the humor relief role, this time the honor goes to Olaf, who is ridiculously naive down to a life threatening fault. His lines are full of puns, out of place clichés and awkward impeccable timing. He delivers more laughs than I expected his corny appearance could do.The writing is absolutely superb, both for the tender moments, the humorous ones and also the musical soundtracks. Songs are beautifully made, they fit the moments amazingly and the cast deliver fantastic job performing them. It's been a while since an animated movie with such excellent heartwarming story, memorable characters and brilliant artwork grace the theater. If one compares Frozen to Lion King, Mulan, Tarzan or any other Disney classics, they wouldn't be wrong.Frozen is a timeless journey.","['like', 'vintage', 'mythical', 'animation', 'disney', 'frozen', 'gift', 'fond', 'memory', 'audience', 'long', 'leave', 'cinema', 'fill', 'stuff', 'childhood', 'memory', 'make', 'lovable', 'character', 'witty', 'humor', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'pleasant', 'graphic', 'animation', 'see', 'success', 'newer', 'technology', 'frozen', 'top', 'near', 'magical', 'feel', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'recent', 'year', 'one', 'movie', 'everyone', 'despite', 'age', 'preference', 'universally', 'enjoy', 'art', 'certain', 'disney', 'aesthetic', 'look', 'best', 'fusion', 'old', 'nuance', 'set', 'create', 'far', 'game', 'movie', 'superior', 'graphic', 'prowess', 'something', 'subtly', 'captivate', 'frozen', 'art', 'direction', 'plenty', 'purplish', 'azure', 'dye', 'transparent', 'ice', 'quite', 'elaborate', 'design', 'detail', 'easy', 'appreciate', 'soft', 'yet', 'intricate', 'wintery', 'nature', 'use', 'effect', 'help', 'surreal', 'environment', 'movie', 'progress', 'visual', 'adapts', 'tricky', 'detail', 'fall', 'snow', 'astute', 'part', 'story', 'ice', 'castle', 'vast', 'snowy', 'plain', 'give', 'feel', 'majesty', 'also', 'hint', 'loneliness', 'character', 'simply', 'lovable', 'anna', 'young', 'princess', 'seriously', 'lack', 'grace', 'brash', 'naive', 'demeanor', 'surely', 'captivate', 'audience', 'downright', 'adorable', 'near', 'impossible', 'feat', 'cheer', 'elsa', 'old', 'one', 'mature', 'restrict', 'character', 'self', 'doubt', 'sadness', 'way', 'movie', 'find', 'one', 'self', 'acceptance', 'others', 'two', 'thing', 'might', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'elsa', 'embodies', 'struggle', 'perfectly', 'often', 'two', 'princess', 'involve', 'however', 'expressive', 'personality', 'sisterhood', 'bond', 'uncanny', 'delight', 'kristoff', 'rugged', 'stud', 'provide', 'chuckle', 'rather', 'odd', 'pauper', 'prince', 'role', 'appear', 'common', 'sense', 'pretty', 'funny', 'see', 'interact', 'odder', 'character', 'sven', 'reindeer', 'olaf', 'magical', 'little', 'snow', 'man', 'plenty', 'humor', 'amongst', 'disney', 'always', 'humor', 'relief', 'role', 'time', 'honor', 'go', 'olaf', 'ridiculously', 'naive', 'life', 'threaten', 'fault', 'line', 'full', 'pun', 'place', 'clich', 'awkward', 'impeccable', 'timing', 'delivers', 'laugh', 'expect', 'corny', 'appearance', 'could', 'write', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'tender', 'moment', 'humorous', 'one', 'also', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'song', 'beautifully', 'make', 'fit', 'moment', 'amazingly', 'cast', 'deliver', 'fantastic', 'job', 'perform', 'since', 'animate', 'movie', 'excellent', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'memorable', 'character', 'brilliant', 'artwork', 'grace', 'theater', 'one', 'compare', 'frozen', 'lion', 'king', 'mulan', 'tarzan', 'disney', 'classic', 'wrong', 'frozen', 'timeless', 'journey']","[9, 4692, 4693, 21, 2, 5, 832, 2807, 412, 159, 169, 322, 543, 481, 698, 466, 412, 14, 726, 8, 1216, 222, 25, 225, 978, 714, 21, 16, 577, 2056, 1379, 5, 239, 449, 170, 53, 173, 1017, 399, 47, 10, 1, 109, 313, 139, 2798, 3791, 91, 749, 563, 2, 3792, 66, 34, 4694, 64, 2611, 144, 134, 142, 925, 1, 1185, 714, 3621, 89, 2273, 1024, 5, 749, 754, 727, 4695, 2978, 33, 124, 1862, 424, 468, 454, 699, 1680, 182, 3256, 3179, 1094, 158, 278, 135, 4696, 1147, 1, 1149, 450, 4697, 4698, 468, 186, 39, 94, 12, 33, 168, 2726, 1218, 915, 57, 53, 3343, 27, 1281, 1505, 8, 341, 726, 7, 73, 29, 667, 273, 1738, 1144, 3257, 960, 1024, 159, 1830, 687, 449, 1762, 2307, 1724, 4, 64, 10, 1022, 8, 429, 681, 1626, 50, 1, 71, 10, 429, 1946, 247, 42, 43, 252, 13, 323, 323, 4, 3258, 639, 456, 583, 42, 29, 584, 110, 3793, 407, 861, 482, 3093, 1062, 67, 1371, 458, 2074, 191, 1258, 82, 371, 582, 999, 217, 136, 85, 16, 2644, 8, 181, 151, 32, 170, 48, 39, 145, 727, 222, 2853, 2, 163, 222, 297, 371, 20, 3568, 13, 32, 2422, 1144, 79, 2517, 1011, 213, 246, 1396, 188, 274, 810, 2407, 1861, 1143, 190, 131, 1737, 1225, 54, 165, 292, 904, 133, 1135, 10, 27, 51, 225, 11, 529, 14, 560, 133, 1824, 227, 1050, 253, 373, 1332, 98, 38, 1, 298, 803, 12, 268, 8, 523, 1767, 1738, 312, 10, 350, 5, 152, 97, 931, 975, 2, 69, 280, 5, 1566, 337]"
483,8,"Another magical cartoon from Disney, meant primarily for kids but with plenty throughout for adults to appreciate too – as is the case with the best cartoons made over the decades whether by Disney, MGM, Hanna-Barbera etc. It adapts Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, adds a few nice shouty songs and special syrup resulting in a nearly masterpiece. It's full of stereotypes and clichés, is image-rich and plot-weak, sweet and short and glib and witty and unrealistic and a fantasy which thankfully ""says nothing to me about my life"". Even if I'm a crusty old guy do I have to like the crusty realism so prevalent nowadays? With variable success I try and follow Thumper's injunction - if you can't say somethin' nice, don't say nuthin' at all.Queen Elsa has dangerous magical powers to freeze things, becomes cold and closed in her attempts not to hurt people or things but eventually flees to an instant ice palace high in the mountains when inadvertently creating a perpetual winter. The only trouble with the film is that either she or the weaselly trader should have been an evil villain instead of unwitting ones for a greater freezing frisson. Sister Anna would then had an external battle to match her internal one. Favourite bits: the relentless sound and vision witticisms in Love Is An Open Door; the trolls Fixer Upper welcoming of Kristof; the great action graphics with Hans and Elsa at the ice palace; Anna freezing to death but more worried about Olaf melting; the heart-warming moral perfectly portrayed in the best Disney tradition. Talk about sistas doing it for themselves! On another note, I find that Disney's conception of female beauty has got so atrophied over time that the handsome males now look far more normal. But I join the Corporation in distancing myself from Kristof's crass bogey-men comment which got right up my nose. The cgi cartoonery is unremittingly excellent and as suitably cold as ice, even breath-taking – where will all this technology lead to?Can I say something crazy?

486,10,"Okay, so I loved Frozen, and I saw a lot of people hating on it. So I'm counter-arguing reasons to hate the movie. Before I do, GO PAY MONEY TO WATCH THIS AMAZING FILM!1.) There are way too many songs.Yeah, ""The Princess And The Frog"" has more. Also, each of these songs has a point, which I'll get into later.2.) Anna is not an interesting character.Okay, most of this comes from her ""dilemma"" of being lonely, compared to Elsa's problems. But honestly, guys, Anna had no idea why the castle was locked up and she wasn't allowed to play with her sister, so you can't blame her for that. Also, she had limited contact with anyone but her parents and the few people on staff that were kept. She, after that, is socially awkward, and one of the most realistic characters- let alone Disney Princesses- ever. Seriously, what other character can pull off the line ""I Wanna Stuff some chocolate in my face!"" without eye-rolling?3.) Olaf was not funny. NO. Olaf was fantastic. And if you don't agree, let me just say that the kids at my school, who are actually mentally advanced beyond their grade and are performing ""Macbeth"" (aka ""Have a High IQ and low tolerance for stupidity""), all burst out laughing for a full minute straight just for ONE of his lines. And for someone who was expecting Martin-Short-bot from Treasure Planet, let me say that this was a pleasant surprise. 4.) Elsa should have been the main protagonist. If she was, this movie would not have been as good. Hear me out! The whole point of having Anna as the protagonist, at least to me, was to show that these writers can make the most complex, tortured and amazing character without drawing too much time on her. If she had been the Main Protagonist, we would have gotten bored of her eventually and wondered what Anna was getting up to. Also, Anna's POV was more important, as otherwise we would have gotten the dreaded Plot Holes.5.) The Twist was predictable. Then you must be psychic. I was in shock for ten minutes afterwords.6.) The songs were pointless. Here are the songs and their points of the story.Frozen Heart- This sets the foreboding mood, gives us light into Kristoff's childhood, and lets us giggle at what the Ice-Men get right.Do You Want to Build a Snowman?- This shows how Elsa can't control her powers, how Anna is dealing with the separation from her sister, as well as how the parents died. (I doubt that's a spoiler; it happens in every Disney movie.)For The First Time in Forever- The classic ""I Want"" song (which is good), also with a little bit of Elsa's fear.Love is an Open Door- I like to call this ""Parody: The Song,"" but it still shows Anna and Hans' instant-relationship pretty well.Let it Go- This is the greatest song in all of humanity! Oh, and it also shows Elsa finding herself and building her palace and outfit. And ""wicked"" hairstyle.Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People- Kristoff's relationship with Sven and the outside world are captured here.In Summer- Olaf's dreams... and hilarity.For The First Time In Forever (Reprise)- This is the song meant so a certain plot thread (no spoilers) could happen, and also shows how the snow reacts to Elsa's fear and anxiety, as well as Anna's optimism. Fixer Upper- To show Kristoff's ""family""'s characters. Also to parody the fans when they heard that Anna might get together with Hans.Let it Go (Single Version)- ...yeah, okay, I'll give you that one. This song was pointless.So there you have it! Six reasons to hate Frozen argued away!

So having been recommended Frozen, I decided to give it a go.Personally, I didn't really get into it that much. There was far too much singing in the first few minutes and that put me off from the word go. The story has a certain resemblance with movies such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" where an act of pure love is the answer to all evil. I guess Frozen is a good old fashion Disney movie with the latest animation possibilities of today's time. But here's the thing, I no longer watch these movies to be blown away by their production skills.

It isn't as good as tangled, (which I will review later.) Let's start with the problems. Number one, there are too many main characters. I'm not saying that the characters are bad but with the exception of Anna and Olaf none of them get the screen time needed. (Bear in mind Olaf is a comedy sidekick and therefore does t need as much screen time.) number two. The characters seem to tread on each other's toes. Two princes, two princesses, two comedy sidekicks? It's a bit much. And finally and this is something that drives me mad, the fixer upper scene. I don't know where to begin.

The only stand out element of this movie is that it is the only Disney movie I can recall that centers around the relationship between two sisters, much like how Brave was one of the only Disney movies featuring a story about the relationship between a mother and daughter.But this characteristic aside, there is little that I found redeeming about this movie.The moose's personality and mannerisms were a COMPLETELY recycled attributes of Flynn's horse in Tangled (An awesome Disney movie).The graphics and special effects for the monster hit theme song Let It Go were definitely overrated. Beauty and the Beast had just as good of a moment -- if not better -- in the sweeping camera ballroom scene.Oloff. F'ing. Oloff -_- The obvious cutesy sidekick character in this movie. He was SO self-aware of his ""cuteness"" that it was completely saturated and contrived. I couldn't stand him, aside from his brief musical number. That was OK. But save for that scene, zero redeeming qualities about this centrally featured supporting character.I don't even care enough about this movie to critique it any further.

494,6,"Frozen is a heart-warming Disney adventure following the story of two sisters: Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) has the power to create ice and snow, but an accident leaves her frightened and isolated from the world; meanwhile younger sister Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) is determined to bring Elsa back out into the world. When their kingdom is plunged into an eternal winter Anna sets off on an adventure to save the kingdom and her sister.This is by no means a ""Christmas"" film, as in there is no Santa or Christmas setting, however I guess it can be classed as a festive film what with it being set in winter! It has a typical sweet-Disney styling: there are catchy songs and likable characters – in particular, Olaf the snowman (voiced by Josh Gad), who provides warm-and-fuzzy moments. The morals of the story and theme of the importance of family are quite endearing, and the characters of the sisters are very relatable. The story itself is fairly simplistic, but different to other Disney films (and apparently inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen""), with a couple of some more complex emotional scenes as well. As a children's film adults can expect to only be mildly entertained by the charm of the animations, and maybe the occasional chuckle at a rare adult joke – It's not got the same enjoyment factor for the adult audience that some other animated classics have (I still love the likes of Monsters Inc (2001) and the Toy Story for example) but perhaps that is because I grew up with those films and appreciated them when I was younger!Frozen is a sweet animation with songs and characters that children will love. I'm a bit too old to be captured by it in the same way that a younger audience would - there was a lot of hype surrounding this film and it fell slightly short of my expectations, but still heart-warming.

497,10,"The shallow trailers don't do the film justice. Without giving anything away, I thought it was very moving. Disney is beginning to expand its definitions of happiness and love and it's great to see them growing. The definition of true love in this film is exactly what true love is all about. It's innovative in other ways too. For example, it doesn't live or die on the villain like other Disney movies have, but finds a more sophisticated, less obvious way to tell a story. Not only are these worthy themes, but they are packaged within a beautifully realized art direction, great voice performances, and good (but not necessarily great) songs. I even though the comedic sidekick had such a different humor that he had me laughing when I least expected it. I thought I would hate it, but I ended up loving it.

This is hands down the best Disney movie in the last decade. The message, animation, music, cast was spectacular!! I downloaded the entire soundtrack as soon as the movie finished. Most importantly the message that this movie gave off was modern and nothing like Disney has ever done before. I loved that this movie showed that woman don't need a man to be successful or to save the day, that a sister's love can be stronger than a man's.

499,10,"A Young Princes named Elsa with an incredible gift, being able to make snow impressed by many. But her reality is sometimes different then what is seems. A gift design for good but, Elsa has to develop her gift, and learn to control it. Frozen has demonstrates a different point of view. How life can change in a second if we do not know how to control the inner us, as well as destroy the ones we love if we make a wrong error without realizing, it too can be our own death. This story is about a young Princess named Elsa, and her young sister Anna, they are in a beautiful palace, where there lives change in a matter of seconds. Elsa has the ability to create snow in any shape or form. She is the only one in her family that has this gift. Her younger sister Anna, has enjoy of the incredible powers Elsa can do. But one day Elsa does not know how to control and ends up damaging her sister without realizing that one wrong move can change everything. Everyone believes Elsa is dangerous, and its Anna's duty to save her sister and make her realize she is not the bad person, everyone things she is.Frozen is an inspiring movie with an incredible meaning behind it. I would recommend this movie to young kids, and there families. Why, because it demonstrate the bond between sister. It is something hard to explain, because it shows the way we treat our siblings, or how much we care for them. In the movie Frozen, the two young sisters bump heads trying too help one another. They are scared to hurt each other. But they did not realize that they need each other to make each other stronger. As I see it with any family, the bound between siblings can not be compared with anything. The movie frozen, made me realize that even if we have different point of view, the only ones who will give us a hand when we need it the most, is our siblings and family. Our own anger can be the death of ourselves if not knowing how to controlling it. When the princess Elsa freezes the city where she lives. She does not realize what harm she is doing and not realizing that her own gift is taking control over her. Elsa needs to learn to value herself and be careful of what she does when she is at the worst, before everything is lost. Focusing on the bad all the time, will destroy who we are, like it slowly destroy her. The value of family, friends, and the people whom we care about, and the ones whom get effected the most. They do not want to cause us any harm, even if we do not think they are correct, we should thing about what we say to them before we push them away and they are no longer there. As we get older we loose a lot of imagination and how creative we are as young kids. But the movie Frozen, brings back so many memories of my childhood. For example, how much I enjoy playing on the snow and wanting summer back after many months of winter. How even playing alone was great, we would not get bored. This movie has a lot of animation, like how Elsa's powers come to her. As when they did the snowman, as odd as it looks. As young kids that how it looks. This movie great artwork and incredible detail, it impressed me in how great it looksThe movie Frozen Directed by Chris Buckma and Jennifer Lee. Has been one of the best Disney movies of the year. I has won sever Awards like the Best Animated Film, Best Display and Best Sound Editing like many others Awards. Not only has it been entertaining for the young generation but some of the older generation has enjoy it as well. It shows us the world of magic in a different perspective, we see magic as evil and avoid using it. In the movie Frozen, it interpret evil and changes it into something different, and magical. Our powers don't necessary have to be super powers, like being too move objects, or transporting from one place to another. But real powers, like being able to help other succeed in this world and make a difference on any age. As a great example, Frozen has been said to give hope that out of all the bad, something positive comes out of it. The emotion we see a great movie, will opens us to new goals. Reviewing this movie I have seen the impact and experience the it do to people of all ages, as well as say its meaning with a unique point of view. Like a saying in frozen, don't be afraid of the person you are, Learn how to control the inner you.","['young', 'prince', 'name', 'elsa', 'incredible', 'gift', 'able', 'make', 'snow', 'impressed',

500,10,"I have written a slew of reviews for multiple newspapers and online websites but this is the first for IMDb, and let me say this, Frozen is a Disney masterpiece that is unmatched by Disney's past. You heard me, unmatched. Frozen is Disney's greatest movie, animated or live action, and here's why.Cast: Frozen's cast is not an All-Star heavy hitter like The Lion King or Toy Story or Monster's Inc. it has a bunch of people I bet you haven't heard of and they just kill their roles! They are magnificent beyond belief! And they do a better job than The Lion King and Monster's Inc. (Toy Story is impossible to beat with Tom Hanks) But you end up loving the characters you are supposed to and hate the ones you are supposed to hate. Bell, Menzel, and Gad (Anna, Elsa, Olaf) are amazing and the best trio of characters since Luke, Leia, and Han Solo.Plot: It's perfectly written! Really no holes. I think Frozen is the first Disney movie with a love triangle, if I'm not mistaken. And it's a feminist movie! This movie is great for young girls to watch, and for guys to learn how to treat girls. It has brilliant lessons, character development, minimal or no plot holes, and several twists.Score: The score was perfect. (for those who don't know, score is music play during scenes without singing) It matched the mood in harmony and helped transition to new moods smoothly, and it's really catchy too. It's a rip off it's not Oscar nominated!Animation: Holy crap this was the best out any Disney movie! The snow and ice look animated but the texture of the snow and ice look completely real. Disney even sent people to study snow for their animation! And it gets a solid A+.Songs: Frozen has the best in any Disney movie I can remember. They are masterfully written and composed. You can tell from Frozen Heart and Do You Want to Build a Snowman at the beginning the songs will be brilliant! I have only two complaints. Fixer Upper (song with trolls) should have been either scrapped or completely redone. It served basically had no purpose and made the whole scene seem too long, and a few lyrics could a flowed better, but overall a great job, and Let It Go was so deliciously perfect! If it doesn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song, then I will never watch the Oscars again, the same if Frozen doesn't win Best Animated Feature Film.Message: Frozen's message is just so heart warming. I'm as manly as a man can get, but I bawled like baby during this movie. Something I never do. (I didn't cry for Old Yeller, Mufasa, or Bambi's mom) but man this movie got to me! There's a deleted scene online of Elsa singing to Anna after a very important scene. I looked it up and I was an emotional wreck. It's called I Want to Build Snowman. And it's so good!!!If you couldn't tell, I love this movie. It's Disney's best and possibly my favorite movie, ever. It certainly surprised me, but it was a pleasant surprise at that. It gets the highest rating I can give and a go watch ASAP if you haven't already! Why are you still here? I'm going to go watch it again.","['write', 'slew', 'review', 'multiple', 'newspaper', 'online', 'website', 'first', 'imdb', 'let', 'say', 'frozen', 'disney', 'masterpiece', 'unmatched', 'disney', 'past', 'heard', 'unmatched', 'frozen', 'disney', 'great', 'movie', 'animate', 'live', 'action', 'cast', 'frozen', 'cast', 'star', 'heavy', 'hitter', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'toy', 'story', 'monster', 'inc', 'bunch', 'people', 'bet', 'heard', 'kill', 'role', 'magnificent', 'beyond', 'belief', 'well', 'job', 'lion', 'king', 'monster', 'inc', 'toy', 'story', 'impossible', 'beat', 'tom', 'hank', 'end', 'love', 'character', 'suppose', 'hate', 'one', 'suppose', 'hate', 'bell', 'menzel', 'gad', 'anna', 'elsa', 'olaf', 'amaze', 'best', 'trio', 'character', 'since', 'luke', 'leia', 'han', 'solo', 'plot', 'perfectly', 'write', 'really', 'hole', 'think', 'frozen', 'first', 'disney', 'movie', 'love', 'triangle', 'mistaken', 'feminist', 'movie', 'movie', 'great', 'young', 'girl', 'watch', 'guy', 'learn', 'treat', 'girl', 'brilliant', 'lesson', 'character', 'development', 'minimal', 'plot', 'hole', 'several', 'twist', 'score', 'score', 'perfect', 'know', 'score', 'music', 'play', 'scene', 'without', 'sing', 'match', 'mood', 'harmony', 'help', 'transition', 'new', 'mood', 'smoothly', 'really', 'catchy', 'rip', 'oscar', 'nominate', 'animation', 'holy', 'crap', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'snow', 'ice', 'look', 'animate', 'texture', 'snow', 'ice', 'look', 'completely', 'real', 'disney', 'even', 'sent', 'people', 'study', 'snow', 'animation', 'get', 'solid', 'song', 'frozen', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'remember', 'masterfully', 'write', 'compose', 'tell', 'frozen', 'heart', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'begin', 'song', 'brilliant', 'two', 'complaint', 'fixer', 'upper', 'song', 'troll', 'either', 'scrap', 'completely', 'redone', 'serve', 'basically', 'purpose', 'make', 'whole', 'scene', 'seem', 'long', 'lyric', 'could', 'flow', 'well', 'overall', 'great', 'job', 'let', 'go', 'deliciously', 'perfect', 'win', 'oscar', 'best', 'original', 'song', 'never', 'watch', 'oscar', 'frozen', 'win', 'best', 'animate', 'feature', 'film', 'message', 'frozen', 'message', 'heart', 'warm', 'manly', 'man', 'get', 'bawl', 'like', 'baby', 'movie', 'something', 'never', 'cry', 'old', 'yeller', 'mufasa', 'bambi', 'mom', 'man', 'movie', 'get', 'delete', 'scene', 'online', 'elsa', 'sing', 'anna', 'important', 'scene', 'look', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'call', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'good', 'tell', 'love', 'movie', 'disney', 'best', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'movie', 'ever', 'certainly', 'surprised', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'get', 'high', 'rating', 'give', 'go', 'watch', 'asap', 'already', 'still', 'go', 'go', 'watch']","[165, 4593, 161, 1418, 4711, 2445, 1960, 36, 866, 30, 35, 5, 2, 461, 4712, 2, 276, 357, 4712, 5, 2, 25, 1, 38, 224, 345, 227, 5, 227, 249, 1376, 4328, 9, 152, 97, 463, 12, 495, 1926, 1211, 46, 1575, 357, 286, 371, 935, 614, 1796, 18, 373, 152, 97, 495, 1926, 463, 12, 1762, 1167, 3802, 41, 6, 8, 473, 333, 10, 473, 333, 146, 116, 257, 7, 4, 32, 96, 34, 2837, 8, 98, 4713, 44, 1618, 52, 456, 165, 22, 697, 37, 5, 36, 2, 1, 6, 2532, 3261, 720, 1, 1, 25, 73, 76, 23, 148, 347, 682, 76, 523, 499, 8, 356, 1939, 52, 697, 608, 129, 223, 223, 175, 56, 223, 58, 204, 90, 137, 63, 553, 1084, 1608, 135, 1740, 108, 1084, 4150, 22, 266, 1580, 302, 1463, 21, 4714, 1114, 34, 2, 1, 39, 33, 66, 38, 1148, 39, 33, 66, 291, 195, 2, 28, 1606, 46, 2084, 39, 21, 19, 664, 11, 5, 34, 2, 1, 391, 3803, 165, 1203, 143, 5, 80, 59, 202, 45, 160, 11, 523, 42, 897, 772, 737, 11, 123, 353, 291, 1173, 570, 646, 14, 127, 90, 75, 169, 475, 54, 1183, 18, 166, 25, 373, 30, 13, 175, 374, 302, 34, 230, 11, 88, 23, 302, 5, 374, 34, 38, 229, 3, 185, 5, 185, 80, 362, 145, 19, 9, 2286, 1, 89, 88, 505, 64, 2040, 1109, 145, 1, 19, 2212, 90, 2445, 4, 63, 7, 289, 90, 66, 342, 352, 308, 59, 202, 45, 17, 143, 6, 1, 2, 34, 842, 189, 1, 81, 442, 703, 978, 445, 19, 206, 437, 57, 13, 23, 397, 68, 13, 13, 23]"

I was fully attracted and made a promise that I will see it.After a week, I went to see the movie with my friends. It was...really something. Whether in music or storyline, all was wonderful. The songs struck a chord in my heart. Singers' interpretation of the songs was amazing. For my first time and forever, I was deeply indulged in the film. I was devoured by spontaneous overflow of feelings and was moved by the power of the sibling, the act of the true love. As people said, Disney came back. This time, not only did he bring songs and happiness back, but also tears and emotions. If your movie conception is that animation is only for child, unfortunately, you are out of the trend. This animation would definitely change your conception. In my opinion, this film do not suit children, but the senior who can feel more about the film. Thanks to the persons who built up the film.

Like usual a failure in Disney? No! No! Frozen was nothing compared to it's expectations! It was brilliant! It was one of the best Disney movie since the lion king. Beautiful characters, each with a soul that can be felt by the audience, and outstanding comedy for a Disney movie. When the movie first came out, I thought it would be like tangled, a movie that just modified an old Disney classic and won fame for no reason! But frozen was brilliant. It deserved the golden globe and it deserves all the upcoming awards which I'm sure it will win. This movie was so good! Although it has a slight feminine touch to it, it is suitable for boys as well and the movie was actually cool! I think that everyone should watch it and make it more beautiful than ever!

506,10,"Well, I've been a huge fan of Disney and cartoons ever since I was a child. Now I'm almost 18, and I still excited for this movie. I was mostly curious about Elsa, cause I love the thought of a character whose life is not only sad, tragic, lonely but also crystal and graceful, who controls a beautiful and dangerous power of nature - Ice. I was right about Elsa. Watching the movie, I can feel her pain, her lonely feelings, her fear of hurting everyone she loves. I also see her fear that no one would ever love her, her father and mother, her sister, Elsa feels that she was loved by none of them, because of her strange and (a bit) scary power. She couldn't except herself and she saw herself as a monster, a curse. However during the movie, she learned to love herself, to be proud of herself and her power. She learned that her sister loved her and would always be there for her. But in the end, it wasn't only Elsa who rent my heart. It was Anna, who is always so afraid of the closing doors, the lonely feeling when hanging in the big castle with no one around. It was Olaf, who seemed to be innocent and happy and funny and cute all the time but sacrificed even his own life for his friends, who looked like a cute character but said something so simple and true that made us think about ""Love is putting someone's needs before yours"" It was Kristoff, who always loves his troll family, always dorky, honest and brave.

The characters are likable within one minute and the conflict is made clear within four minutes. It's still Disney so expect singing and family values, but I went with my four daughters (13 to 25) and they all loved it. There were small children all around us.

Frozen is a complete entertaining movie that has many funny, sad and jaw dropping moments. As far as animation concerns, you don't to worry about that when you are watching a movie created by Disney. Frozen offers exceptionally good animation and characters so far created by any production company.

Another thing that makes Frozen stand out is the message the love from your family can sometimes be better than romantic love.

513,-,"Ah, Frozen. It's created Frozen Fever for the below-10 crowd. Around 2015-16, it was all Frozen Frozen Frozen in the girls' toy aisles. Frozen's merchandise and third-party products have given it a life of its own, beyond the mere movie that inspired them. When I first saw the movie, I gave it a 7. But a couple of years afterwards, with plenty of Frozen merchandise under my belt, I feel like I should give it a 10 - cult status, a franchise, a pop culture phenomenon, like LOTR, Twilight, and Star Wars. I'll settle for a compromise, and I'll give it a 9 for this review. Frozen's most endearing and enduring aspect is the beauty of the characters. The scenery, majestic castles, and ice castle are beautiful, too. Elsa is one of the most stunning characters in the history of animation. She's like one of those gilded country singers. I still don't know what she did all day cooped up in her ice castle, but a girl can dream. Anna is very pretty, too. She has a gorgeous, multi-colored costume that looks faux-Swiss or Nordic or whatever. Anna's princely love interest, Hans, is nice-looking, in an average way. Kristoff, oddly enough, is way handsomer, so I don't know why she didn't fall in love with him immediately. Do these animated characters have eyes or not? Humans are, unfortunately, visual creatures, so beautiful visuals in a film really speak to us, and lead to much more. Frozen inspired a clusterf--k of affilated merchandise, coloring books, memes, Pinterest pins, dreamy ""princess"" art, DeviantArt musings, etc. It's the cult of the princess in American pop culture. Little girls like it, and they don't know why they like it - it's just marketed to girls, and it fits the popular conception of what girls should like. Frozen is good because it inspires you to dream, and it's escapism, and it fits into the Pinterest-y dreams that young American women are suckered into. Frozen's songs are maybe second-rate, but they're still good. Mainly I know that Idina Menzel sang Elsa's songs in Frozen. Menzel is a semi-celebrity for the geek and Broadway crowd. She's the most famous Wicked actress, and for that, she's beloved. Of course, the surprise element of the sisterly love between Elsa and Anna is one of the hallmarks of the film. It's creative and innovative. You'd think it's another prince-saves-the-princess film, but that's been done too many times in the history of Disney. In 2013, Disney needed to think harder. Frozen is a gorgeous, perfect fantasy for girls and women. It will forever have its place in pop culture geekdom, like Harry Potter, Star Trek, Narnia, etc. It gives Beauty and the Beast a run for the money. Frozen and Beauty & the Beast fans have a lot of crossover. Both are girly, pretty fantasies with gorgeous mansions, landscapes, and lead characters. Beauty & the Beast has the deeper, more profound story, but still. In this age of Pinterest, Instagram, and third-party merchandise, it's not the story that's the king - it's the mere visual, or meme.","['ah', 'frozen', 'create', 'frozen', 'fever', 'crowd', 'around', 'frozen', 'frozen', 'frozen', 'girl', 'toy', 'aisle', 'frozen', 'merchandise', 'third', 'party', 'product', 'give', 'life', 'beyond', 'mere', 'movie', 'inspire', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'give', 'couple', 'year', 'afterwards', 'plenty', 'frozen', 'merchandise', 'belt', 'feel', 'like', 'give', 'cult', 'status', 'franchise', 'pop', 'culture', 'phenomenon', 'like', 'lotr', 'twilight', 'star', 'war', 'settle', 'compromise', 'give', 'review', 'frozen', 'endear', 'endure', 'aspect', 'beauty', 'character', 'scenery', 'majestic', 'castle', 'ice', 'castle', 'beautiful', 'elsa', 'one', 'stun', 'character', 'history', 'animation', 'like', 'one', 'gild', 'country', 'singer', 'still', 'know', 'day', 'cooped', 'ice', 'castle', 'girl', 'dream', 'anna', 'pretty', 'gorgeous', 'multi', 'color', 'costume', 'look', 'faux', 'swiss', 'nordic', 'whatever', 'anna', 'princely', 'love', 'interest', 'han', 'nice', 'look', 'average', 'way', 'kristoff', 'oddly', 'enough', 'way', 'handsomer', 'know', 'fall', 'love', 'immediately', 'animate', 'character', 'eye', 'human', 'unfortunately', 'visual', 'creature', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'film', 'really', 'speak', 'u', 'lead', 'much', 'frozen', 'inspire', 'clusterf', 'k', 'affilated', 'merchandise', 'color', 'book', 'meme', 'pinterest', 'pin', 'dreamy', 'princess', 'art', 'deviantart', 'musing', 'etc', 'cult', 'princess', 'american', 'pop', 'culture', 'little', 'girl', 'like', 'know', 'like', 'market', 'girl', 'fit', 'popular', 'conception', 'girl', 'like', 'frozen', 'good', 'inspires', 'dream', 'escapism', 'fit', 'pinterest', 'dream', 'young', 'american', 'woman', 'suckered', 'frozen', 'song', 'maybe', 'second', 'rate', 'still', 'good', 'mainly', 'know', 'idina', 'menzel', 'sang', 'elsa', 'song', 'frozen', 'menzel', 'semi', 'celebrity', 'geek', 'broadway', 'crowd', 'famous', 'wicked', 'actress', 'beloved', 'course', 'surprise', 'element', 'sisterly', 'love', 'elsa', 'anna', 'one', 'hallmark', 'film', 'creative', 'innovative', 'think', 'another', 'prince', 'save', 'princess', 'film', 'many', 'time', 'history', 'disney', 'disney', 'need', 'think', 'harder', 'frozen', 'gorgeous', 'perfect', 'fantasy', 'girl', 'woman', 'forever', 'place', 'pop', 'culture', 'geekdom', 'like', 'harry', 'potter', 'star', 'trek', 'narnia', 'etc', 'give', 'beauty', 'beast', 'run', 'money', 'frozen', 'beauty', 'beast', 'fan', 'lot', 'crossover', 'girly', 'pretty', 'fantasy', 'gorgeous', 'mansion', 'landscape', 'lead', 'character', 'beauty', 'beast', 'deeper', 'profound', 'story', 'still', 'age', 'pinterest', 'instagram', 'third', 'party', 'merchandise', 'story', 'king', 'mere', 'visual', 'meme']","[2257, 5, 134, 5, 1881, 1150, 200, 5, 5, 5, 76, 463, 4555, 5, 949, 715, 1123, 1060, 57, 79, 614, 1876, 1, 500, 36, 157, 1, 57, 398, 47, 2391, 727, 5, 949, 1276, 53, 9, 57, 3208, 3264, 1361, 658, 1034, 1981, 9, 4578, 3613, 249, 1442, 2037, 3141, 57, 161, 5, 1478, 2006, 443, 149, 8, 1217, 2457, 168, 33, 168, 93, 4, 10, 315, 8, 636, 21, 9, 10, 872, 706, 68, 56, 138, 33, 168, 76, 626, 7, 136, 444, 1590, 651, 1336, 66, 3399, 1692, 653, 7, 4725, 6, 122, 44, 192, 66, 921, 50, 67, 2771, 164, 50, 56, 186, 6, 597, 38, 8, 336, 515, 573, 450, 1334, 93, 267, 3, 22, 641, 177, 248, 31, 5, 500, 2068, 949, 651, 596, 3808, 3809, 3265, 29, 749, 430, 3208, 29, 1413, 658, 1034, 48, 76, 9, 56, 9, 1447, 76, 560, 559, 2527, 76, 9, 5, 17, 3810, 626, 560, 3809, 626, 73, 1413, 251, 5, 11, 232, 319, 694, 68, 17, 934, 56, 141, 116, 1142, 4, 11, 5, 116, 2746, 3473, 3030, 411, 1150, 903, 678, 1495, 1280, 228, 445, 401, 711, 6, 4, 7, 10, 2337, 3, 1014, 1831, 37, 102, 82, 111, 29, 3, 61, 20, 636, 2, 2, 99, 37, 4224, 5, 444, 175, 545, 76, 251, 287, 188, 658, 1034, 9, 249, 2009, 2645, 430, 57, 149, 203, 233, 661, 5, 149, 203, 176, 84, 3266, 136, 545, 444, 4726, 889, 248, 8, 149, 203, 1354, 1823, 12, 68, 139, 3809, 715, 1123, 949, 12, 97, 1876, 450, 3808]"

515,7,"Yet another sumptuous PIxar animated feature and the first in a long time to actually be an adaptation of a classic fairy tale (Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Snow Queen""). With a catchy soundtrack, witty and amusing dialogue and excellent artwork, this is one of the best latter-day Disney's and was deserving of its runaway (or should that be skateaway?) box-office success.Young Queen Anna's ice-throwing powers are very-well illustrated by the animators on top of their usual mastery of movement, background and facial expressions. The songs come at you a bit like a snowstorm, thick and fast, but they are always apropos the plot and invariably stirring and moving (the soundtrack album topped the US Billboard album chart for weeks on original release, which must say something about the standard of composition).Sure, the big-eyed, idealised forms of the human characters arguably overdoes the ""cute factor"" but it's not as if Pixar is going to abandon the formula which has brought it so much success from ""Toy Story"" onwards. I actually thought, about a third of the way into the movie, that the story was going to be carried wholly by ""human"" characters with no talking animals, in fact there was a nice spoof on this early in the film with Kristof having an amusing ventriloquist-type conversation with himself and his faithful reindeer Sven, but of course, the introduction of talking multi-part snowman Alf just couldn't be resisted. Funny as he is, I suspect commercial considerations aimed at the infant ""want-that-toy"" market were at work.Also predictable was the introduction of a bad-guy protagonist just to reinforce Disney's perennial need for a whole ""good versus evil"" battle, but again, this time the quarter from where this arises was unexpected and seemed forced. In films of this type, I think it's better if the baddie is identifiable from the start rather than slipped in under the viewer's nose as occurs here. And while I'm carping, couldn't a better film title have been employed too, I mean I know they seem to like snappy one-word titles (c.f. ""Up"", ""Brave"" et. al) but what was wrong with tributing Anderson's source story properly?Anyway, I did enjoy the film, there was lots of pithy and funny dialogue, the songs were varied and amusing and by the end, my heart of ice was probably melted, but while I would say it was one of the better Pixar productions, I wouldn't rate it as the very best. Maybe the inevitable sequel (""Deeper Frozen"" anyone?) will rectify some of the minor failings I detected here.","['yet', 'another', 'sumptuous', 'pixar', 'animate', 'feature', 'first', 'long', 'time', 'actually', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'catchy', 'soundtrack', 'witty', 'amuse', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'artwork', 'one', 'best', 'latter', 'day', 'disney', 'deserve', 'runaway', 'skateaway', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'young', 'queen', 'anna', 'ice', 'throw', 'power', 'well', 'illustrate', 'animator', 'top', 'usual', 'mastery', 'movement', 'background', 'facial', 'expression', 'song', 'come', 'bit', 'like', 'snowstorm', 'thick', 'fast', 'always', 'apropos', 'plot', 'invariably', 'stir', 'move', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'topped', 'u', 'billboard', 'album', 'chart', 'week', 'original', 'release', 'must', 'say', 'something', 'standard', 'composition', 'sure', 'big', 'eyed', 'idealise', 'form', 'human', 'character', 'arguably', 'overdoes', 'cute', 'factor', 'pixar', 'go', 'abandon', 'formula', 'brought', 'much', 'success', 'toy', 'story', 'onwards', 'actually', 'thought', 'third', 'way', 'movie', 'story', 'go', 'carry', 'wholly', 'human', 'character', 'talk', 'animal', 'fact', 'nice', 'spoof', 'early', 'film', 'kristof', 'amuse', 'ventriloquist', 'type', 'conversation', 'faithful', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'course', 'introduction', 'talk', 'multi', 'part', 'snowman', 'alf', 'resist', 'funny', 'suspect', 'commercial', 'consideration', 'aim', 'infant', 'want', 'toy', 'market', 'work', 'also', 'predictable', 'introduction', 'bad', 'guy', 'protagonist', 'reinforce', 'disney', 'perennial', 'need', 'whole', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'battle', 'time', 'quarter', 'arises', 'unexpected', 'seem', 'force', 'film', 'type', 'think', 'well', 'baddie', 'identifiable', 'start', 'rather', 'slip', 'viewer', 'nose', 'occurs', 'carp', 'well', 'film', 'title', 'employ', 'mean', 'know', 'seem', 'like', 'snappy', 'one', 'word', 'title', 'c', 'f', 'brave', 'et', 'al', 'wrong', 'tributing', 'anderson', 'source', 'story', 'properly', 'anyway', 'enjoy', 'film', 'lot', 'pithy', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'song', 'varied', 'amuse', 'end', 'heart', 'ice', 'probably', 'melt', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'well', 'pixar', 'production', 'rate', 'best', 'maybe', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'deeper', 'frozen', 'anyone', 'rectify', 'minor', 'failing', 'detect']","[182, 102, 194, 38, 229, 36, 169, 20, 103, 891, 69, 219, 114, 44, 245, 467, 39, 49, 266, 225, 1216, 828, 719, 298, 1767, 10, 34, 955, 138, 2, 483, 598, 717, 577, 73, 49, 7, 33, 744, 24, 18, 3354, 812, 239, 562, 886, 617, 1482, 1069, 11, 40, 95, 9, 4440, 4202, 780, 163, 52, 4728, 2288, 242, 225, 2254, 3811, 177, 3812, 2254, 4729, 1078, 230, 288, 236, 35, 89, 633, 2524, 207, 106, 1814, 427, 515, 8, 1390, 265, 945, 194, 13, 1622, 534, 599, 31, 577, 463, 12, 4730, 103, 92, 715, 50, 1, 12, 13, 853, 3813, 515, 8, 178, 876, 201, 192, 594, 3, 1230, 828, 524, 1730, 2561, 151, 181, 228, 1304, 178, 1590, 94, 45, 2289, 85, 1845, 1520, 3267, 859, 59, 463, 1447, 107, 27, 331, 1304, 65, 148, 354, 4731, 2, 4732, 99, 127, 17, 1985, 277, 1435, 20, 3663, 894, 75, 272, 3, 524, 37, 18, 2533, 4733, 120, 191, 1687, 479, 971, 3231, 18, 3, 590, 3814, 218, 56, 75, 9, 4407, 10, 548, 590, 1781, 1272, 335, 3087, 4734, 280, 467, 1092, 12, 1675, 497, 91, 3, 84, 85, 719, 11, 3510, 828, 41, 80, 33, 210, 359, 26, 35, 10, 18, 194, 700, 694, 34, 232, 2232, 561, 1354, 5, 299, 4116, 670]"

Anna enlists the help of Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. They meet the magical snowman Olaf created by Elsa. Once again, it boils down to an act of true love.This is an interesting if somewhat uneven Disney princess story. The opening exposition is a little clunky. It could do with some more careful rewrites. The story wants to follow both sisters. It's probably better to keep the POV on Anna from the beginning. This is above all else about sisterly love. The big midpoint reveal may work even better much earlier. It could have been an aside to the audience. The love story would be simplified and clearer which is more fitting for a kids movie. The songs are all big bombastic Broadway tunes. The catchiest part is the chorus of 'Let It Go'.

This film, like all other Disney Animated Classics, has beautiful animation, and, like Tangled, manages to give us CGI that is obviously CGI, but yet has the feel of the 2D animation that Disney is best known for. The 3D for this film is really cool too and compliments the stunning visuals and animation. The characters are wonderful. They're respective voice actors offer entertaining performances which are well written. When I saw the character Olaf in the advertising, I predicted that he would be shoved in my face, but no! Compared to most of the comic relief characters from Disney movies, Olaf was downplayed just enough to stay out of the way of the story, but still stay around long enough to get some good laughs (yes, he was funny). Most of the songs are beautifully written and composed (""Fixer Upper"" and ""In Summer"" were OK). The story is also wonderfully orchestrated. I will not give anything away, but I will say that it plays with your expectations a lot. I would've given this film 10 stars, but I chose to take away one because of those two songs and also because it is never explained how Elsa got her powers.

It turned out to be a good decision.Frozen is fun to watch. The story is about the princess sisters Elsa and Anna. Elsa has magical power which she cannot control and unintentionally hurts her sister and turns her kingdom into eternal winter. The film has good character development. Besides, I quite like the idea of true love in this film which is different from Disney classic fairy tales. (You've got to see it to know what I mean. ^^ )Frozen is also accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack. There are two songs I love especially: 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman?' and 'Let It Go'. Elsa was voiced by Idina Menzel, who played the original Elphaba in Wicked the musical, so the song is really powerful like the power of Elsa.It's just a pity that the pace of the film is a bit too rushed.

525,8,"'FROZEN': Four Stars (Out of Five) Disney's most financially successful and critically acclaimed animated musical film since it's glory days in the 1990s! It's a loose adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale 'The Snow Queen' and tells the story of a queen with cryokinetic abilities who accidentally places her kingdom in a state of constant winter weather and her estranged sister who sets out to save the land and her sister. The film stars one of my favorite actresses Kristen Bell, as the voice of the heroic princess, and also features a voice cast including Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, Santino Fontana, Ciarán Hinds and Alan Tudyk. It was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee and co-written by Buck, Lee and Shane Morris. I'd say it's definitely a lot better than the current crop of animated Disney films (that Pixar's not involved with) and mostly deserves it's critical praise.The film begins when Anna (Bell) and Elsa (Menzel) are children. They're princesses of Arendelle and Elsa also has the ability to freeze things. One night when they're playing together Elsa accidentally hurts Anna with her powers. Their parents take them to see magical trolls and Anna is healed but in order to protect her Anna's memories of Elsa's special abilities are erased and Elsa is forbidden from playing with her little sister anymore. After the king and queen die at sea (when the girls are much older) Elsa is made queen of Arendelle. At her coronation Anna meets Prince Hans (Fontana) and immediately falls for him. When he proposes Anna gleefully accepts but Elsa refuses to give her blessing for their wedding (due to the fact that they just met). This causes an argument which unleashes Elsa's magical powers in front of all the guests. Elsa runs away while accidentally freezing all the land. Anna sets out to find her sister in order to save her and Arendelle. She finds help in the form of a childhood snowman which comes to life, named Olaf (Gad), and a mountain man, named Kristoff (Groff), and his reindeer Sven.The film surprisingly isn't filled with the usual bad kids jokes (and lame pop culture references) Disney usually fills it's animated kids' movies with. It's actually charming, the characters are likable and the story and drama is somewhat involving. It's funny enough in an adequate way and emotional enough where it needs to be. The songs are also catchy and well done. It's got all the magical touches that used to make Disney animated films classic and Kristen Bell is wonderfully cast as a Disney princess. The movie also has a great message about family and love. For people that grew up on movies like this it's a joy and kids will probably like it too.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAefz9rzS5w","['frozen', 'four', 'star', 'five', 'disney', 'financially', 'successful', 'critically', 'acclaim', 'animate', 'musical', 'film', 'since', 'glory', 'day', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'snow', 'queen', 'tell', 'story', 'queen', 'cryokinetic', 'ability', 'accidentally', 'place', 'kingdom', 'state', 'constant', 'winter', 'weather', 'estrange', 'sister', 'set', 'save', 'land', 'sister', 'film', 'star', 'one', 'favorite', 'actress', 'kristen', 'bell', 'voice', 'heroic', 'princess', 'also', 'feature', 'voice', 'cast', 'include', 'idina', 'menzel', 'josh', 'gad', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'santino', 'fontana', 'ciar', 'n', 'hind', 'alan', 'tudyk', 'direct', 'chris', 'buck', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'co', 'write', 'buck', 'lee', 'shane', 'morris', 'say', 'definitely', 'lot', 'well', 'current', 'crop', 'animate', 'disney', 'film', 'pixar', 'involve', 'mostly', 'deserves', 'critical', 'praise', 'film', 'begin', 'anna', 'bell', 'elsa', 'menzel', 'child', 'princess', 'arendelle', 'elsa', 'also', 'ability', 'freeze', 'thing', 'one', 'night', 'play', 'together', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'hurt', 'anna', 'power', 'parent', 'take', 'see', 'magical', 'troll', 'anna', 'heal', 'order', 'protect', 'anna', 'memory', 'elsa', 'special', 'ability', 'erase', 'elsa', 'forbidden', 'play', 'little', 'sister', 'anymore', 'king', 'queen', 'die', 'sea', 'girl', 'much', 'old', 'elsa', 'make', 'queen', 'arendelle', 'coronation', 'anna', 'meet', 'prince', 'han', 'fontana', 'immediately', 'fall', 'proposes', 'anna', 'gleefully', 'accepts', 'elsa', 'refuse', 'give', 'blessing', 'wedding', 'due', 'fact', 'met', 'cause', 'argument', 'unleashes', 'elsa', 'magical', 'power', 'front', 'guest', 'elsa', 'run', 'away', 'accidentally', 'freeze', 'land', 'anna', 'set', 'find', 'sister', 'order', 'save', 'arendelle', 'find', 'help', 'form', 'childhood', 'snowman', 'come', 'life', 'name', 'olaf', 'gad', 'mountain', 'man', 'name', 'kristoff', 'groff', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'fill', 'usual', 'bad', 'kid', 'joke', 'lame', 'pop', 'culture', 'reference', 'disney', 'usually', 'fill', 'animate', 'kid', 'movie', 'actually', 'charm', 'character', 'likable', 'story', 'drama', 'somewhat', 'involve', 'funny', 'enough', 'adequate', 'way', 'emotional', 'enough', 'need', 'song', 'also', 'catchy', 'well', 'get', 'magical', 'touch', 'use', 'make', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'classic', 'kristen', 'bell', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'message', 'family', 'love', 'people', 'grow', 'movie', 'like', 'joy', 'kid', 'probably', 'like', 'watch', 'movie', 'review', 'show', 'movie', 'talk', 'http', 'www', 'youtube', 'com', 'watch', 'v', 'paefz', 'rzs', 'w']","[5, 784, 249, 731, 2, 3820, 814, 3821, 1942, 38, 51, 3, 98, 1619, 138, 937, 891, 44, 245, 339, 219, 114, 39, 49, 143, 12, 49, 2534, 367, 300, 188, 77, 881, 2371, 105, 986, 1747, 15, 144, 111, 757, 15, 3, 249, 10, 189, 1495, 162, 146, 86, 2812, 29, 27, 229, 86, 227, 349, 141, 116, 275, 257, 455, 377, 688, 665, 4736, 2823, 1997, 1134, 1426, 721, 526, 490, 464, 416, 1263, 165, 490, 416, 4118, 4119, 35, 174, 84, 18, 1481, 38, 2, 3, 194, 584, 567, 592, 1458, 535, 3, 160, 7, 146, 4, 116, 70, 29, 199, 4, 27, 367, 282, 43, 10, 773, 204, 332, 4, 300, 305, 7, 24, 118, 55, 16, 170, 123, 7, 1234, 496, 513, 7, 412, 4, 316, 367, 972, 4, 3151, 204, 48, 15, 892, 97, 49, 368, 1002, 76, 31, 64, 4, 14, 49, 199, 343, 7, 244, 82, 44, 665, 597, 186, 2860, 7, 2173, 4, 1383, 57, 1528, 3243, 404, 201, 392, 328, 1375, 1884, 4, 170, 24, 938, 2790, 4, 233, 101, 300, 282, 757, 7, 144, 71, 15, 496, 111, 199, 71, 135, 427, 466, 45, 40, 79, 183, 32, 257, 214, 145, 183, 67, 377, 151, 181, 3, 1179, 481, 562, 65, 60, 451, 1344, 658, 1034, 1246, 2, 460, 481, 38, 60, 1, 103, 235, 8, 402, 12, 745, 572, 584, 85, 164, 2701, 50, 342, 164, 99, 11, 27, 266, 18, 19, 170, 260, 158, 14, 2, 38, 3, 69, 162, 146, 1261, 227, 2, 29, 1, 27, 25, 185, 72, 6, 46, 285, 1, 9, 738, 60, 210, 9, 23, 1, 161, 78, 1, 178, 1666, 1489, 1654, 968, 23, 1330, 4737]"

527,9,"There are the people who adore this film just like myself, and the few who simply criticize its every aspect. The people who dare say that Frozen does not compare to The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the beast might be right, but remember, these masterpieces of the Disney Renaissance have been around for a long time now, and that span of 20 years leaves us establishing an emotional/nostalgic bond with the songs, characters, and the story. I chiefly can say that this generation will forever love the beauty and nostalgia Frozen brought the viewers. In 20 years from now, you will hear people saying nothing can compete with Frozen (and alike with Wreck it Ralph, and Tangled). It is a test of time of course, but all in all, Frozen leaves us with the pure Disney Magic we have been waiting for a long while. You can not deny the beauty of the animation. It is simply spectacular, just amazing. The ice and snow animation are feasts for the eyes, especially in the Let it Go sequence. Regarding the songs, there maybe some that appeal to us better than others, but you still catch yourself singing every song in the film, because they are meant to be catchy, they are Broadway styled, not pop-y. The characters are greatly developed, and though some parts felt rushed, I and many others were pleased with what was offered to us, for what we could see. If you haven't seen it yet, and wonder if its worth all the hype, you should see it, because it truly deserves the hype, but you will initially be the judge of that. All in all, it is a film that will forever withstand as a Disney classic and favorite for generations to come.","['people', 'adore', 'film', 'like', 'simply', 'criticize', 'every', 'aspect', 'people', 'dare', 'say', 'frozen', 'compare', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'might', 'right', 'remember', 'masterpiece', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'around', 'long', 'time', 'span', 'year', 'leaf', 'u', 'establish', 'emotional', 'nostalgic', 'bond', 'song', 'character', 'story', 'chiefly', 'say', 'generation', 'forever', 'love', 'beauty', 'nostalgia', 'frozen', 'brought', 'viewer', 'year', 'hear', 'people', 'say', 'nothing', 'compete', 'frozen', 'alike', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'tangle', 'test', 'time', 'course', 'frozen', 'leaf', 'u', 'pure', 'disney', 'magic', 'wait', 'long', 'deny', 'beauty', 'animation', 'simply', 'spectacular', 'amaze', 'ice', 'snow', 'animation', 'feast', 'eye', 'especially', 'let', 'go', 'sequence', 'regard', 'song', 'maybe', 'appeal', 'u', 'well', 'others', 'still', 'catch', 'sing', 'every', 'song', 'film', 'meant', 'catchy', 'broadway', 'style', 'pop', 'character', 'greatly', 'developed', 'though', 'part', 'felt', 'rush', 'many', 'others', 'pleased', 'offer', 'u', 'could', 'see', 'see', 'yet', 'wonder', 'worth', 'hype', 'see', 'truly', 'deserves', 'hype', 'initially', 'judge', 'film', 'forever', 'withstand', 'disney', 'classic', 'favorite', 'generation', 'come']","[46, 1190, 3, 9, 341, 1339, 115, 443, 46, 1110, 35, 5, 350, 48, 422, 149, 203, 252, 130, 391, 461, 2, 465, 200, 169, 20, 1789, 47, 586, 177, 2170, 342, 1709, 482, 11, 8, 12, 35, 616, 287, 6, 149, 1677, 5, 599, 479, 47, 568, 46, 35, 156, 2738, 5, 725, 352, 379, 83, 1279, 20, 228, 5, 586, 177, 724, 2, 150, 415, 169, 1893, 149, 21, 341, 671, 96, 33, 39, 21, 3268, 336, 121, 30, 13, 502, 902, 11, 232, 484, 177, 18, 247, 68, 1321, 63, 115, 11, 3, 868, 266, 411, 355, 658, 8, 1316, 610, 100, 94, 155, 525, 61, 247, 1515, 705, 177, 54, 16, 16, 182, 532, 254, 406, 16, 329, 592, 406, 2026, 1592, 3, 287, 3669, 2, 69, 189, 616, 40]"

531,10,"When people speak of their favorite Disney movies, the big four of the Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion.The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant.Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation.FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.","['people', 'speak', 'favorite', 'disney', 'movie', 'big', 'four', 'renaissance', 'film', 'golden', 'age', 'animation', 'likely', 'mention', 'past', 'decade', 'see', 'disney', 'movie', 'hit', 'miss', 'consider', 'classic', 'forgotten', 'close', 'classic', 'yet', 'frozen', 'change', 'dynamic', 'creates', 'full', 'fledge', 'classic', 'frozen', 'classic', 'disney', 'classic', 'decade', 'could', 'position', 'best', 'disney', 'return', 'root', 'vengeance', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'past', 'year', 'opinion', 'story', 'heart', 'melt', 'fill', 'pure', 'feel', 'heart', 'become', 'staple', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'move', 'story', 'family', 'center', 'unpretentious', 'try', 'portray', 'comedy', 'hit', 'right', 'mark', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'thrill', 'journey', 'make', 'tale', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'exact', 'right', 'amount', 'dare', 'movie', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moment', 'stun', 'provoke', 'others', 'achieve', 'balance', 'true', 'triumph', 'story', 'tell', 'prof', 'exactly', 'disney', 'best', 'prove', 'back', 'produce', 'top', 'quality', 'film', 'affect', 'human', 'story', 'one', 'significant', 'startle', 'stun', 'beautifully', 'envision', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'relevant', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'stun', 'backdrop', 'intricacy', 'like', 'never', 'see', 'environment', 'costume', 'character', 'movement', 'among', 'thing', 'make', 'film', 'gigantic', 'step', 'forward', 'brilliant', 'voice', 'talent', 'breath', 'life', 'project', 'need', 'applaud', 'cast', 'consist', 'kristen', 'bell', 'veronica', 'mar', 'idina', 'menzel', 'wicked', 'among', 'many', 'others', 'bring', 'win', 'charm', 'superior', 'voice', 'act', 'magnificent', 'vocal', 'well', 'heart', 'tale', 'sensational', 'wit', 'humor', 'array', 'different', 'personality', 'emotion', 'triumph', 'fall', 'make', 'interest', 'character', 'people', 'relate', 'best', 'see', 'animation', 'cast', 'fully', 'become', 'character', 'score', 'music', 'perfect', 'score', 'grand', 'sound', 'texture', 'harmony', 'melody', 'class', 'beyond', 'anything', 'attempt', 'animation', 'studio', 'past', 'decade', 'would', 'place', 'song', 'movie', 'enchant', 'true', 'round', 'musical', 'triumph', 'song', 'stuck', 'mind', 'hum', 'even', 'know', 'belting', 'top', 'lung', 'good', 'song', 'progress', 'story', 'essential', 'part', 'meticulously', 'craft', 'breath', 'take', 'animation', 'affect', 'tale', 'bond', 'family', 'romance', 'hilarious', 'wit', 'humor', 'courtesy', 'character', 'especially', 'sweet', 'olaf', 'heart', 'stop', 'adventure', 'true', 'fairy', 'tale', 'would', 'say', 'could', 'well', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'generation', 'frozen', 'disney', 'magic', 'miss', 'long', 'come', 'full', 'force']","[46, 641, 189, 2, 1, 106, 784, 465, 3, 796, 139, 21, 1016, 348, 276, 492, 16, 2, 1, 234, 271, 421, 69, 1017, 351, 69, 182, 5, 209, 988, 797, 246, 2297, 69, 5, 69, 2, 69, 492, 54, 1391, 34, 2, 385, 885, 2554, 34, 38, 3, 276, 47, 258, 12, 80, 359, 481, 724, 53, 80, 179, 1704, 34, 2, 1, 242, 12, 72, 649, 2298, 87, 1018, 279, 234, 130, 820, 345, 1184, 326, 1019, 337, 14, 114, 48, 95, 132, 1392, 130, 624, 1110, 1, 190, 798, 133, 315, 1607, 247, 1531, 677, 62, 989, 12, 143, 909, 522, 2, 34, 799, 74, 587, 239, 283, 3, 1076, 515, 12, 10, 1705, 2299, 315, 529, 2104, 910, 439, 1335, 444, 267, 315, 1821, 1947, 9, 88, 16, 1147, 1336, 8, 886, 471, 43, 14, 3, 2105, 668, 571, 523, 86, 800, 990, 79, 1020, 99, 1235, 227, 2106, 162, 146, 1532, 1533, 141, 116, 678, 471, 61, 247, 221, 374, 235, 1185, 86, 112, 935, 821, 18, 80, 114, 1948, 1455, 222, 2107, 140, 407, 240, 989, 186, 14, 122, 8, 46, 785, 34, 16, 21, 227, 822, 179, 8, 223, 58, 175, 223, 936, 259, 1148, 1608, 1186, 1283, 614, 212, 448, 21, 311, 276, 492, 26, 188, 11, 1, 615, 62, 911, 51, 989, 11, 954, 320, 1048, 28, 56, 1949, 239, 2108, 17, 11, 1149, 12, 1337, 94, 2555, 1021, 990, 55, 21, 1076, 114, 482, 72, 363, 364, 1455, 222, 2300, 8, 121, 457, 32, 80, 284, 326, 62, 219, 114, 26, 35, 54, 18, 48, 422, 149, 203, 616, 5, 2, 150, 271, 169, 40, 246, 272]"

553,8,"Review:
'Frozen' is a computer-animated musical-fantasy film directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. It is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale ""The Snow Queen"".
I was late to the party with this movie. I actually hadn't seen it until it was out on DVD and I rented it from my local movie store. I was surprised by this movie because I didn't see all the hype around it, and that made it more enjoyable.
It tells the story of fearless princess Anna (Kristen Bell) who sets off on a journey alongside a rugged iceman (Jonathan Groff), his loyal reindeer, and a naive snowman (Josh Gad) to find her estranged sister, Elsa (Idina Menzel), whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped their kingdom in eternal winter.
All of the voice acting in this movie is incredible. The actors really take the form of these characters and bring them to life. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel are both admirable as Anna and Elsa, while the rest are also full of personality.
What brings it to the table even more are the songs. There is a sense of Broadway indeed, blending it with its wondrous animation makes it more captivating. Sure, most of the songs became over played almost immediately after the soundtrack was released, but you can't say they're bad songs. They're great. The animation is also beautiful, showcasing the beauty of both the characters and the atmosphere around Arendelle.
Overall, the movie is beautifully animated and has a great cast of voice actors. It may not have the best re-watch factor, but you will enjoy at least the first viewing.

555,9,"This movie is one of my favorite Disney movies ever since which is Frozen. The story is mainly about a snow Queen who scares to be herself and scares to regulate her own power. Actually, she has one younger sister Anna. When Elsa was a kid, she used to play with Anna, but one day she played uncarelessly with her sister, then she unintentionally released her icy power to her sister's heart which was an eternal curse. After that, she was cured by a mystical troll and never had a chance to play with Elsa again.
One day, it's time for Elsa to take control the whole kingdom Arendelle. In other word, she is going to become a queen. As a result, Elsa and Anna had chance to meet each other again. After the royal coronation ceremony day passed, there's a big party fulled with crowded people coming from many different cities. Anna found Prince Hans, and she thought it's a true love. After telling Elsa about this, she uncontrollably released her icy power without knowing that her power made a neverending winter in the Arendelle, then she ran away to a far away land. Her younger sister, Anna, had to bring summer back to Arendelle. She started the journey by following her sister's footstep, and accidentally met Kristoff, who was a lumberjack. Kristoff decided to help Anna find Elsa for returning summer to the kingdom.
There're three main characters which are Elsa, Anna and Kristoff. They made the story much more impressive filled with joy and happiness, although there're some sad scenes a bit. It can make the story recalled by most spectators, even though they watched it for a long time.
This story is totally involved with love between family or even girl and boy. When I watch it, it make me feel like our world is much more beautiful filled with love. In my point of view, there're some scenes which are funny. For example, at the end of the story Olaf, who is a snowman with a big carrot for his nose, said that he would melt because of the hot weather, so Elsa use her power to create a cloud with a snow above Olaf's head, and then he felt excited and acted in a kind of weird, but funny. There's one scene that represents love in the family, and it remind me of how much my family love me.
Sometimes we don't have to try hard to find where true love is, but look back to our family who always stays by our side and always be there for you. No matter what happens, family is the only thing who always stays with you. In fact, you have to believe yourself that you can do it. Don't let your fear overcome you, but you have to overcome it. This movie taught me a lot. Just be proud of who you really are, and try to be the best version of you, so you won't regret at all. Frozen can inspire you quite a lot.
Frozen may appropriates to people of all ages. It's a comedy animation film, and it's a heartwarming either. Actually, it's not a serious movie at all. In my perspective, most kids must enjoy watching Frozen because it involves with magic and the song is so sweet too.

558,7,"The weak point of animation is close up. Close up in live actor's action is very effective in description of the change in the emotion of the person. Surprise, sadness, shock and no expression. The close up expression of the characters directly affects to the audience's heart. That's because it is a real human face, so it won't be effective in anime.
But 3D seems a little different. The delicate expression of Ana is very well expressed, and when you look at her face, you will naturally like her. The personality, facial expression and voice are very good in harmony. I think that is the reason that this movie made great hit.The bad point is that her older sister's suffering is not well described. The writers had to think of a more effective episode and convey her suffering well to the audience. When she jumps out of the castle and the famous song begins, but I'm not the only one who felt that the part was so sudden and premature in the story.
But if you want to write that part well, it will probably take time. The main character of this movie is not her, so the writers want to avoid it. That's why it went wrong.
So it was a work that was not great a whole, but since the idea of the last was good, it became a shining work. Namely, the love is not only love of men and women. That part was good, impressive. Well, movies are all good when it's the last scene is good.

562,7,"The souls of feminists unite as Frozen finally breaks through old Disney cliché's. Young women can attach to Disney's prototypical fantasy world of princesses and castles, but Frozen does not let them dream infinitely as the film's conclusion shows the love and strength within all women's hearts; strength in the confidence women have as individuals and equals. While the movie's message is powerful and well overdue, the fact is Frozen's flaws are impossible to overlook. Disney fell short in creating a dream world, as the entire setting happens within one town, never stretching beyond outlying mountains. The film's plot begins and ends within a two day span, leaving viewers with the hopeless task of believing monumental character change occurred in such a short period of time. The audience is also expected to understand the depth within each character as young adults, based on single, insignificant, events that happened in childhood. Disney's difficult task of designing films for all ages will always create plot rifts, but the film's strong themes warranted more depth within the movie. The film is simply not on the same level as Disney's previous classics, but Frozen will be remembered as the catalyst in re-shaping Disney's gender ideals for the better.","['soul', 'feminist', 'unite', 'frozen', 'finally', 'break', 'old', 'disney', 'clich', 'young', 'woman', 'attach', 'disney', 'prototypical', 'fantasy', 'world', 'princess', 'castle', 'frozen', 'let', 'dream', 'infinitely', 'film', 'conclusion', 'show', 'love', 'strength', 'within', 'woman', 'heart', 'strength', 'confidence', 'woman', 'individual', 'equal', 'movie', 'message', 'powerful', 'well', 'overdue', 'fact', 'frozen', 'flaw', 'impossible', 'overlook', 'disney', 'fell', 'short', 'create', 'dream', 'world', 'entire', 'set', 'happens', 'within', 'one', 'town', 'never', 'stretch', 'beyond', 'outlying', 'mountain', 'film', 'plot', 'begin', 'end', 'within', 'two', 'day', 'span', 'leave', 'viewer', 'hopeless', 'task', 'believe', 'monumental', 'character', 'change', 'occur', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'audience', 'also', 'expect', 'understand', 'depth', 'within', 'character', 'young', 'adult', 'base', 'single', 'insignificant', 'event', 'happen', 'childhood', 'disney', 'difficult', 'task', 'design', 'film', 'age', 'always', 'create', 'plot', 'rift', 'film', 'strong', 'theme', 'warrant', 'depth', 'within', 'movie', 'film', 'simply', 'level', 'disney', 'previous', 'classic', 'frozen', 'remember', 'catalyst', 'shape', 'disney', 'gender', 'ideal', 'well']","[1074, 720, 4750, 5, 241, 340, 64, 2, 274, 73, 251, 1764, 2, 4751, 545, 126, 29, 168, 5, 30, 626, 3, 734, 78, 6, 887, 654, 251, 80, 887, 2077, 251, 1921, 1718, 1, 185, 439, 18, 3766, 201, 5, 386, 1762, 2247, 2, 843, 263, 134, 626, 126, 264, 144, 591, 654, 10, 602, 88, 2319, 614, 4752, 214, 3, 52, 160, 41, 654, 42, 138, 1789, 322, 479, 4753, 3271, 220, 3833, 8, 209, 1932, 263, 1295, 20, 159, 27, 131, 216, 609, 654, 8, 73, 147, 256, 741, 3635, 618, 290, 466, 2, 1113, 3271, 424, 3, 139, 163, 134, 52, 2467, 3, 167, 226, 2789, 609, 654, 1, 3, 341, 440, 2, 763, 69, 5, 391, 4754, 1317, 2, 1288, 2829, 18]"

564,8,"There are no spoilers in this review so I highly encourage you to read this review in its entirety before you decide to spend your money taking the family to see this movie.I will begin by giving you some background. I am not a fan of musicals of any genre. I have never made it through The Wizard of Oz from beginning to end and I literally fell asleep during a live performance of Phantom of the Opera.Taking that into account, Frozen still managed to entertain myself and my two boys, aged 9 and 6, for a majority of the movie. Later, I will explain exactly what I mean by that.This movie is a visual spectacle and cinematically speaking, it is an incredible site to behold viewed in 3D as we saw it. Animators have come a long way since the early days of Mickey Mouse and the 3D in this movie was flawlessly executed. The 3D effects were also subtle and not in your face like many other 3D movies which exploit it gratuitously like Spy Kids 4D (perhaps the worst movie I have ever reviewed).I was quite impressed with the storyline as well. It was a unique story and not your typical good vs evil flick that has been done a million times over. The true villain was not revealed until the latter half of the movie. The music was also extremely well done and did not overly detract from the movie itself. I repeat, I am not a fan of this type of movie and my 9 year old also expressed that he thought there was a bit too much singing. But overall it was still a spectacle to behold.Now on the negative side, the movie is listed as being 1 hour and 25 minutes long. After commercials, previews and a short Disney 'cartoon' before the movie begins, it was almost 2 hours long. The producers must realize that the target audience of such a movie is families with children of varying ages and attention spans. My boys were starting to get a bit antsy by the end and my 6 year old needed to use the bathroom half way thru. Frozen seemed to drag a bit in spots and the producers, in conjunction with the editors, could have easily deleted a few scenes or pared down a few and it would not have detracted at all from the story. An animated film produced for families does not require this level of complexity and character development to entertain. It's not Shindler's List or the Ten Commandments! There are also a few loud and frightening scenes that may not be appropriate for small children. I heard one youngster crying in the theatre.Frozen will inevitably go down in history as a classic and result in hundreds of millions of dollars in box office and related revenue for the Disney money-making machine. I also have no doubt that it will garner several Oscar nominations in the animation and musical score categories. It is a great family movie and will entertain for generations to come. However, I would not recommend this movie if you have children under the age of 5, for the reasons mentioned above, or if you have children with limited attention spans or are easily frightened. If you do take your family to see this movie, be prepared for a long journey and get the kids to use the bathroom BEFORE you take your seats.","['spoiler', 'review', 'highly', 'encourage', 'read', 'review', 'entirety', 'decide', 'spend', 'money', 'take', 'family', 'see', 'movie', 'begin', 'give', 'background', 'fan', 'musical', 'genre', 'never', 'make', 'wizard', 'oz', 'begin', 'end', 'literally', 'fell', 'asleep', 'live', 'performance', 'phantom', 'opera', 'take', 'account', 'frozen', 'still', 'manage', 'entertain', 'two', 'boy', 'age', 'majority', 'movie', 'later', 'explain', 'exactly', 'mean', 'movie', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'cinematically', 'speak', 'incredible', 'site', 'behold', 'view', 'saw', 'animator', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'since', 'early', 'day', 'mickey', 'mouse', 'movie', 'flawlessly', 'execute', 'effect', 'also', 'subtle', 'face', 'like', 'many', 'movie', 'exploit', 'gratuitously', 'like', 'spy', 'kid', 'perhaps', 'bad', 'movie', 'ever', 'review', 'quite', 'impressed', 'storyline', 'well', 'unique', 'story', 'typical', 'good', 'v', 'evil', 'flick', 'million', 'time', 'true', 'villain', 'reveal', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', 'music', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'overly', 'detract', 'movie', 'repeat', 'fan', 'type', 'movie', 'year', 'old', 'also', 'express', 'thought', 'bit', 'much', 'sing', 'overall', 'still', 'spectacle', 'behold', 'negative', 'side', 'movie', 'list', 'hour', 'minute', 'long', 'commercial', 'preview', 'short', 'disney', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'begin', 'almost', 'hour', 'long', 'producer', 'must', 'realize', 'target', 'audience', 'movie', 'family', 'child', 'vary', 'age', 'attention', 'span', 'boy', 'start', 'get', 'bit', 'antsy', 'end', 'year', 'old', 'need', 'use', 'bathroom', 'half', 'way', 'thru', 'frozen', 'seem', 'drag', 'bit', 'spot', 'producer', 'conjunction', 'editor', 'could', 'easily', 'delete', 'scene', 'par', 'would', 'detract', 'story', 'animate', 'film', 'produce', 'family', 'require', 'level', 'complexity', 'character', 'development', 'entertain', 'shindler', 'list', 'ten', 'commandment', 'also', 'loud', 'frighten', 'scene', 'may', 'appropriate', 'small', 'child', 'heard', 'one', 'youngster', 'cry', 'theatre', 'frozen', 'inevitably', 'go', 'history', 'classic', 'result', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollar', 'box', 'office', 'related', 'revenue', 'disney', 'money', 'make', 'machine', 'also', 'doubt', 'garner', 'several', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'animation', 'musical', 'score', 'category', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'entertain', 'generation', 'come', 'however', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'child', 'age', 'reason', 'mention', 'child', 'limited', 'attention', 'span', 'easily', 'frighten', 'take', 'family', 'see', 'movie', 'prepared', 'long', 'journey', 'get', 'kid', 'use', 'bathroom', 'take', 'seat']","[419, 161, 472, 1657, 547, 161, 3835, 491, 1031, 661, 55, 72, 16, 1, 160, 57, 617, 176, 51, 768, 88, 14, 2282, 3273, 160, 41, 643, 843, 3836, 224, 493, 3837, 1473, 55, 1732, 5, 68, 857, 243, 42, 408, 139, 1163, 1, 358, 400, 522, 218, 1, 450, 1506, 641, 549, 2388, 2052, 413, 157, 812, 40, 169, 50, 98, 594, 138, 850, 707, 1, 2444, 1450, 278, 27, 1302, 381, 9, 61, 1, 2470, 9, 60, 578, 65, 1, 81, 161, 124, 947, 295, 18, 414, 12, 376, 17, 1330, 277, 805, 965, 20, 62, 104, 528, 955, 346, 1, 58, 27, 423, 18, 1200, 2861, 1, 1431, 176, 524, 1, 47, 64, 27, 1099, 92, 95, 31, 63, 166, 68, 1506, 2052, 761, 387, 1, 550, 487, 211, 169, 1520, 1568, 263, 2, 314, 1, 160, 173, 487, 169, 1543, 236, 428, 1037, 159, 1, 72, 70, 3798, 139, 541, 1789, 408, 120, 19, 95, 4721, 41, 47, 64, 99, 158, 1952, 346, 50, 5, 75, 1045, 95, 1278, 1543, 4756, 54, 403, 2212, 90, 1028, 26, 2861, 12, 38, 3, 587, 72, 1364, 440, 1797, 8, 356, 243, 550, 829, 27, 798, 1516, 90, 171, 1742, 601, 70, 357, 10, 2347, 505, 1275, 5, 3274, 13, 636, 69, 648, 1540, 965, 1446, 598, 717, 1312, 3228, 2, 661, 14, 2456, 27, 681, 2531, 608, 302, 1469, 21, 51, 223, 1693, 25, 72, 1, 243, 616, 40, 110, 26, 262, 1, 70, 139, 180, 348, 70, 1576, 541, 1789, 403, 1516, 55, 72, 16, 1, 1964, 169, 337, 19, 60, 158, 1952, 55, 966]"

566,7,"This year Disney teaming up again with Pixar presents us a winterly fairy tale so warm that will certainly thaw our hearts. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale 'The Snow Queen', 'Frozen' follows Princess Anna on a quest to bring her sister Queen Elsa back to her kingdom which owing to her icy powers is accidentally trapped in eternal winter. Full of optimism and courage Anna is determined to bring her sister back and restore her kingdom to flourish. En Route she encounters Kristoff, an ice trader with his reindeer and Olaf, a crazy and hilarious snowman.They are back and they are good this time. 'Frozen' is packed with an amazing and smartly written script, some hummable & memorable sing- alongs and striking visuals (whoa, the technology has made possible rendering as never seen. The lighting looks so natural). This is what Disney excelled at. Its like a tribute to the legacy of all those movies we enjoyed as kids - The Lion King, The Little Mermaid etc.The best factor about this movie is its closeness to real life issues despite being a fantasy tale. Notice, there is no scheming villain here in here to interrupt the journey. All there is, is the conflict with inner selves and difference in perceptions. The humor and the optimistic approach towards relationships will appeal to folks of all ages and stir their emotions as well. In all, a tale that will melt your heart and leave you wondering only if our world were as beautiful.","['year', 'disney', 'team', 'pixar', 'present', 'u', 'winterly', 'fairy', 'tale', 'warm', 'certainly', 'thaw', 'heart', 'inspire', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'snow', 'queen', 'frozen', 'follow', 'princess', 'anna', 'quest', 'bring', 'sister', 'queen', 'elsa', 'back', 'kingdom', 'owe', 'icy', 'power', 'accidentally', 'trap', 'eternal', 'winter', 'full', 'optimism', 'courage', 'anna', 'determine', 'bring', 'sister', 'back', 'restore', 'kingdom', 'flourish', 'en', 'route', 'encounter', 'kristoff', 'ice', 'trader', 'reindeer', 'olaf', 'crazy', 'hilarious', 'snowman', 'back', 'good', 'time', 'frozen', 'packed', 'amaze', 'smartly', 'write', 'script', 'hummable', 'memorable', 'sing', 'alongs', 'strike', 'visuals', 'whoa', 'technology', 'make', 'possible', 'render', 'never', 'see', 'light', 'look', 'natural', 'disney', 'excel', 'like', 'tribute', 'legacy', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'kid', 'lion', 'king', 'little', 'mermaid', 'etc', 'best', 'factor', 'movie', 'closeness', 'real', 'life', 'issue', 'despite', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'notice', 'scheme', 'villain', 'interrupt', 'journey', 'conflict', 'inner', 'self', 'difference', 'perception', 'humor', 'optimistic', 'approach', 'towards', 'relationship', 'appeal', 'folk', 'age', 'stir', 'emotion', 'well', 'tale', 'melt', 'heart', 'leave', 'wonder', 'world', 'beautiful']","[47, 2, 486, 194, 663, 177, 219, 114, 362, 442, 775, 80, 500, 44, 245, 339, 219, 114, 39, 49, 5, 378, 29, 7, 1527, 221, 15, 49, 4, 74, 77, 2862, 453, 24, 300, 900, 310, 105, 246, 2856, 1689, 7, 993, 221, 15, 74, 1934, 77, 3785, 3453, 1650, 951, 67, 33, 1756, 151, 32, 1008, 364, 45, 74, 17, 20, 5, 1184, 96, 2627, 165, 395, 4504, 268, 63, 1193, 267, 1379, 14, 673, 1254, 88, 16, 735, 66, 1660, 2, 4641, 9, 4757, 3424, 1, 91, 60, 152, 97, 48, 422, 430, 34, 945, 1, 3838, 195, 79, 519, 313, 545, 114, 692, 1467, 104, 4662, 337, 552, 1154, 429, 1164, 222, 1268, 1111, 538, 153, 484, 1417, 139, 2288, 240, 18, 114, 359, 80, 322, 532, 126, 93]"

The style is very much like that of Tangled. They look so realistic and beautiful. Apart from the amazing graphics there were some great songs. Of course there are songs, this is a musical. I see people complaining about the amount of songs and i must say there are a lot. But is that a bad thing in this case? The voices were very nice to listen to, the lyrics were very cleverly put together and the music was really nice. Disney really outdid themselves this time with the musical songs. Humour, yes there was a lot of great humour. It was not over the top, nor was there too much. There were funny parts in the entire movie, suitable for adults and children. I even think some of the humour was to far fetched for children and only really understandable for adults which made it fun for all ages. The plot was different from most of the Disney movies i've ever watched. It wasn't just a princess story, it was so much more. The characters were very well made and believable and also very likable. Olaf the snowman and Glen the reindeer were very fun and really added something to the story other than being just filler. All in all, I enjoyed this movie very much and rate it very high on my 'best Disney movies' list. Disney really showed everyone what they are still capable of and that they continue to create really great animation films. I can't wait what they come up with for their next feature film. Frozen was one of those movies you can watch over and over and never get bored off.","['expect', 'lot', 'new', 'disney', 'flick', 'exceed', 'expectation', 'let', 'begin', 'animation', 'wow', 'wow', 'look', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'style', 'much', 'like', 'tangle', 'look', 'realistic', 'beautiful', 'apart', 'amaze', 'graphic', 'great', 'song', 'course', 'song', 'musical', 'see', 'people', 'complain', 'amount', 'song', 'must', 'say', 'lot', 'bad', 'thing', 'case', 'voice', 'nice', 'listen', 'lyric', 'cleverly', 'put', 'together', 'music', 'really', 'nice', 'disney', 'really', 'outdid', 'time', 'musical', 'song', 'humour', 'yes', 'lot', 'great', 'humour', 'top', 'much', 'funny', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'suitable', 'adult', 'child', 'even', 'think', 'humour', 'far', 'fetch', 'child', 'really', 'understandable', 'adult', 'make', 'fun', 'age', 'plot', 'different', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'watch', 'princess', 'story', 'much', 'character', 'well', 'make', 'believable', 'also', 'likable', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'glen', 'reindeer', 'fun', 'really', 'add', 'something', 'story', 'filler', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'much', 'rate', 'high', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'list', 'disney', 'really', 'show', 'everyone', 'still', 'capable', 'continue', 'create', 'really', 'great', 'animation', 'film', 'wait', 'come', 'next', 'feature', 'film', 'frozen', 'one', 'movie', 'watch', 'never', 'get', 'bore']","[131, 84, 108, 2, 805, 1669, 452, 30, 160, 21, 926, 926, 66, 292, 444, 355, 31, 9, 83, 66, 640, 93, 512, 96, 714, 25, 11, 228, 11, 51, 16, 46, 1460, 624, 11, 236, 35, 84, 65, 43, 514, 86, 192, 531, 475, 4761, 196, 332, 58, 22, 192, 2, 22, 20, 51, 11, 732, 325, 84, 25, 732, 239, 31, 85, 94, 264, 1, 2031, 147, 70, 28, 37, 732, 142, 3503, 70, 22, 2230, 147, 14, 125, 139, 52, 140, 2, 1, 81, 23, 29, 12, 31, 8, 18, 14, 1374, 27, 402, 32, 45, 151, 125, 22, 269, 89, 12, 1504, 91, 1, 31, 694, 206, 34, 2, 1, 550, 2, 22, 78, 109, 68, 1924, 647, 134, 22, 25, 21, 3, 415, 40, 418, 229, 3, 5, 10, 1, 23, 88, 19, 604]"

580,7,"Given the mass of animated features of late, it becomes hard to discern which stable any given title derives from; given the Walt Disney Studios' monopoly of the market for so many decades, their efforts remain among the more popular but not necessarily the best with respect to both box-office performance or, for that matter, when accolades are doled out. So, when the film under review copped 2 Oscars (Best Animated Feature and Original Song ""Let It Go"") at last Sunday's ceremony, I thought of checking it out now rather than wait for the Christmas season – for which period I usually leave such family-oriented fare!In retrospect and, to my surprise, the end result was generally very satisfactory – evoking favourable memories of some of the brand name's better efforts of the last 25 years! The narrative is inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen fairy-tale (of which I also own but have yet to watch a 1966 live-action Russian version). The icy setting is appropriately elaborate and nicely detailed, while characterization is reasonably appealing – at least where the two female protagonists are concerned, and especially with respect to their unusually tense relationship, as well as the obligatory comic-relief sidekick (represented by a garrulous snowman called Olaf who has a carrot for a nose, is constantly getting dismembered and, at one point, even deadpans about having been impaled on a jutting piece of ice!). On the heroic side of things, we have a stocky woodcutter and his sympathetic reindeer but, oddly enough, the orphaned princesses are shown growing up sans guardians!Conversely, the rogues' gallery – involving an elderly foreign tradesman and a young, deceptively handsome but opportunistic visiting prince – seems decidedly weak in comparison; similarly, the would-be sinister elements – a group of wise and friendly trolls on one hand and a giant snow creature (whom we thought had been disposed of but reappears for the, by now inevitable, post-credits sequence!) on the other – somehow feel like an afterthought! The climax, too, is sort of underwhelming because the sense of awe expected, after considerable build-up (and the film clocks in at a hefty 102 minutes), is rather lacking!; still, the songs – which are definitely not what I look forward to the most in efforts of this type – prove surprisingly tolerable on this occasion...which brings us back to ""Let It Go"", whose live performance during Oscar night was not only introduced by John Travolta apparently struggling with a bad hair day, but he also went on to spectacularly mispronounce singer Idina Menzel's name (incidentally, the star quality typically found among the engaged voice artists is conspicuous in its absence here) as Adele Dazeem while obliged to wax about her ""wicked"" talents!","['give', 'mass', 'animate', 'feature', 'late', 'becomes', 'hard', 'discern', 'stable', 'give', 'title', 'derives', 'give', 'walt', 'disney', 'studio', 'monopoly', 'market', 'many', 'decade', 'effort', 'remain', 'among', 'popular', 'necessarily', 'best', 'respect', 'box', 'office', 'performance', 'matter', 'accolade', 'doled', 'film', 'review', 'copped', 'oscar', 'best', 'animate', 'feature', 'original', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'last', 'sunday', 'ceremony', 'thought', 'check', 'rather', 'wait', 'christmas', 'season', 'period', 'usually', 'leave', 'family', 'orient', 'fare', 'retrospect', 'surprise', 'end', 'result', 'generally', 'satisfactory', 'evoke', 'favourable', 'memory', 'brand', 'name', 'well', 'effort', 'last', 'year', 'narrative', 'inspire', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'also', 'yet', 'watch', 'live', 'action', 'russian', 'version', 'icy', 'set', 'appropriately', 'elaborate', 'nicely', 'detailed', 'characterization', 'reasonably', 'appeal', 'least', 'two', 'female', 'protagonist', 'concerned', 'especially', 'respect', 'unusually', 'tense', 'relationship', 'well', 'obligatory', 'comic', 'relief', 'sidekick', 'represent', 'garrulous', 'snowman', 'call', 'olaf', 'carrot', 'nose', 'constantly', 'get', 'dismember', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'deadpans', 'impale', 'jutting', 'piece', 'ice', 'heroic', 'side', 'thing', 'stocky', 'woodcutter', 'sympathetic', 'reindeer', 'oddly', 'enough', 'orphan', 'princess', 'show', 'grow', 'sans', 'guardian', 'conversely', 'rogue', 'gallery', 'involve', 'elderly', 'foreign', 'tradesman', 'young', 'deceptively', 'handsome', 'opportunistic', 'visit', 'prince', 'seem', 'decidedly', 'weak', 'comparison', 'similarly', 'would', 'sinister', 'element', 'group', 'wise', 'friendly', 'troll', 'one', 'hand', 'giant', 'snow', 'creature', 'thought', 'dispose', 'reappears', 'inevitable', 'post', 'credit', 'sequence', 'somehow', 'feel', 'like', 'afterthought', 'climax', 'sort', 'underwhelming', 'sense', 'awe', 'expect', 'considerable', 'build', 'film', 'clock', 'hefty', 'minute', 'rather', 'lack', 'still', 'song', 'definitely', 'look', 'forward', 'effort', 'type', 'prove', 'surprisingly', 'tolerable', 'occasion', 'brings', 'u', 'back', 'let', 'go', 'whose', 'live', 'performance', 'oscar', 'night', 'introduce', 'john', 'travolta', 'apparently', 'struggle', 'bad', 'hair', 'day', 'also', 'go', 'spectacularly', 'mispronounce', 'singer', 'idina', 'menzel', 'name', 'incidentally', 'star', 'quality', 'typically', 'found', 'among', 'engage', 'voice', 'artist', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'adele', 'dazeem', 'oblige', 'wax', 'wicked', 'talent']","[57, 2617, 38, 229, 530, 380, 307, 3749, 4764, 57, 590, 57, 410, 2, 311, 1447, 61, 492, 575, 1436, 471, 559, 1284, 34, 1311, 598, 717, 493, 375, 3275, 3, 161, 302, 34, 38, 229, 230, 11, 30, 13, 197, 2363, 1851, 92, 1310, 191, 415, 743, 1040, 1295, 460, 322, 72, 2502, 1591, 445, 41, 648, 1004, 4765, 2961, 412, 1545, 183, 18, 575, 197, 47, 802, 500, 44, 245, 339, 219, 114, 27, 182, 23, 224, 345, 4766, 435, 453, 144, 3841, 1862, 1231, 1488, 1640, 2458, 484, 250, 42, 237, 354, 2200, 121, 1311, 3842, 3276, 153, 18, 2146, 309, 297, 436, 1194, 45, 308, 32, 1146, 971, 1176, 19, 10, 117, 28, 3843, 588, 33, 2812, 387, 43, 4767, 1616, 151, 2771, 164, 2291, 29, 78, 285, 4618, 1768, 4316, 2653, 3277, 584, 1579, 3844, 73, 739, 1341, 82, 75, 4574, 434, 1126, 2348, 26, 4768, 401, 849, 1041, 837, 123, 10, 323, 1171, 39, 1334, 92, 4769, 2232, 1285, 662, 502, 981, 53, 9, 3111, 792, 539, 3278, 217, 2059, 131, 3497, 202, 3, 3552, 4760, 211, 191, 273, 68, 11, 174, 66, 571, 575, 524, 799, 1179, 1914, 4770, 509, 177, 74, 30, 13, 620, 224, 493, 302, 773, 736, 1205, 3739, 755, 639, 65, 844, 138, 27, 13, 3845, 706, 141, 116, 183, 4398, 249, 283, 1782, 231, 471, 619, 86, 1886, 4771, 3125, 678, 800]"

583,8,"The Disney juggernaut Frozen is a retelling of the Hans Christian Anderson classic The Snow Queen. It's garnered a tremendous amount of hype and do you know what? It's justified.Princess Elsa's (Menzel) ability to create frost and snow is exposed at her coronation, and she flees Arendelle under a cloud. Her sister, Anna (Bell), pursues her to bring her home and absolve the claims of sorcery levelled against her.Frozen is very much a story about these two sisters, with the male characters in supporting roles. Depending on which newspaper you read, it's the most pro-Christian Disney movie in history, or an insidious attempt to promote an LGBT agenda. In reality, it's neither of these, it's simply a story with very strong female leads and a wealth of themes to unpack and draw your own conclusions from.Both the Anna and Elsa garner sympathy from the audience. This is, after all, a plight inflicted on Elsa without her having choice in the matter. And poor Anna, in the opening song, being rejected by her sister through a closed door is very upsetting, which makes her unwavering support for Elsa throughout the movie all the more moving.Among the comedy characters, Olaf (Gad) stands head and carrot above the rest as the world's happiest snowman. He's charmingly designed and has some hilarious lines, though Kirstoff (Groff) and his reindeer Sven are not without a giggle here and there.All of the action is accompanied by an excellent score. Even aside from its famous, and insanely catching, big hit Let It Go, the incidental score by Jeff Draheim is haunting in a way Disney hasn't really done before. Something about it is a little less jovial than previous movies, and it works well for the unforgiving icy setting.The story is straightforward and subplots are lacking, which gives Frozen a little less depth. This might be, partly, due to the lack of focal villain for much of the movie. The trolls are also underused; Kristoff's adoptive mother (Wilson) seemed to want to be akin to Timon's mother (The Lion King 3) but didn't ever get the opportunity to be that.Frozen is a straightforward story that packs a punch: a powerful message wrapped up in a thrilling, enchanting romp.","['disney', 'juggernaut', 'frozen', 'retell', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'classic', 'snow', 'queen', 'garner', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'hype', 'know', 'justified', 'princess', 'elsa', 'menzel', 'ability', 'create', 'frost', 'snow', 'expose', 'coronation', 'flees', 'arendelle', 'cloud', 'sister', 'anna', 'bell', 'pursues', 'bring', 'home', 'absolve', 'claim', 'sorcery', 'level', 'frozen', 'much', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'male', 'character', 'support', 'role', 'depend', 'newspaper', 'read', 'pro', 'christian', 'disney', 'movie', 'history', 'insidious', 'attempt', 'promote', 'lgbt', 'agenda', 'reality', 'neither', 'simply', 'story', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'wealth', 'theme', 'unpack', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'anna', 'elsa', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'plight', 'inflict', 'elsa', 'without', 'choice', 'matter', 'poor', 'anna', 'opening', 'song', 'reject', 'sister', 'close', 'door', 'upset', 'make', 'unwavering', 'support', 'elsa', 'throughout', 'movie', 'move', 'among', 'comedy', 'character', 'olaf', 'gad', 'stand', 'head', 'carrot', 'rest', 'world', 'happiest', 'snowman', 'charmingly', 'design', 'hilarious', 'line', 'though', 'kirstoff', 'groff', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'without', 'giggle', 'action', 'accompany', 'excellent', 'score', 'even', 'aside', 'famous', 'insanely', 'catch', 'big', 'hit', 'let', 'go', 'incidental', 'score', 'jeff', 'draheim', 'haunt', 'way', 'disney', 'really', 'something', 'little', 'less', 'jovial', 'previous', 'movie', 'work', 'well', 'unforgiving', 'icy', 'set', 'story', 'straightforward', 'subplots', 'lack', 'give', 'frozen', 'little', 'less', 'depth', 'might', 'partly', 'due', 'lack', 'focal', 'villain', 'much', 'movie', 'troll', 'also', 'underused', 'kristoff', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'wilson', 'seem', 'want', 'akin', 'timon', 'mother', 'lion', 'king', 'ever', 'get', 'opportunity', 'frozen', 'straightforward', 'story', 'pack', 'punch', 'powerful', 'message', 'wrap', 'thrill', 'enchant', 'romp']","[2, 5, 2250, 44, 245, 467, 69, 39, 49, 2531, 1869, 624, 406, 56, 2248, 29, 4, 116, 367, 134, 1686, 39, 1318, 343, 710, 199, 1777, 15, 7, 146, 4773, 221, 533, 1042, 2536, 440, 5, 31, 12, 42, 15, 431, 8, 740, 371, 2719, 4711, 547, 1319, 245, 2, 1, 636, 448, 1829, 3721, 3080, 940, 1197, 341, 12, 167, 237, 248, 4774, 226, 1128, 734, 7, 4, 2531, 2130, 159, 1890, 4, 137, 862, 375, 973, 7, 631, 11, 1836, 15, 351, 478, 1320, 14, 740, 4, 296, 1, 242, 471, 279, 8, 32, 257, 361, 317, 1146, 303, 126, 4643, 45, 3421, 424, 364, 213, 100, 4775, 377, 151, 181, 137, 1388, 345, 1472, 298, 223, 28, 716, 903, 2338, 1321, 106, 234, 30, 13, 4776, 223, 2665, 50, 2, 22, 89, 48, 321, 4777, 763, 1, 107, 18, 453, 144, 12, 1806, 2213, 273, 57, 5, 48, 321, 609, 252, 3847, 404, 273, 3244, 104, 31, 1, 123, 27, 4778, 67, 4779, 883, 4780, 75, 59, 3096, 3072, 883, 152, 97, 81, 19, 759, 5, 1806, 12, 2161, 1359, 439, 185, 1735, 1019, 615, 3848]"
584,9,"Frozen is a 2013 American 3D film produced by Walt Disney Studio. This is one of my favorite Disney's movie-- it's a lovely movie and mischievously funny. The thing which catches my heart is the love between the sisters (Elsa & Anna). When they were little, Elsa once hurts Anna so she agree to lock herself in the room so no one else will get hurt again. However, because of their sister-relationship, Anna always tries to go near her and asks her to play. For the sweet character Olaf, he's so cute and caring. The moment he tries to help Anna he says ""SOME PEOPLE ARE WORTH MELTING FOR"". Those words touch my hearts (he is my favorite character). There parts where you can laugh out loud and feel pity at some moments. The story is full of heart-melting, pure feeling, romance, and two hearts become as one. It's an incredible story with perfect music, script,etc... The soundtrack of the movie will make you addicted, i believe you'll be singing the song over and over again.

While last year's ""Wreck-It Ralph"" was a marvel to behold and among their most enjoyable films ever, ""Frozen"" comes to play with a stream of great songs and some good humor (Olaf the snowman will quickly grow on you).The source material, Hans Christian Andersen, is heavily buried in this story, which seems to owe much more to original thinking with just a dash of Kurt Vonnegut's ""Cat's Cradle"". And this is a good thing, because the fairy tale is quite dark and relies too much on Christian theology with demons and such. (Not that Christian theology makes a bad film -- the world of Narnia is beloved -- but it would be out of character for Disney.) One wonders if this will be the breakout role for Kristen Bell. While already known as Veronica Mars, she never quite hit the mainstream.

590,8,"Disney finally came to their senses and said, ''Alright, Pixar is going down hill, and we have our own Disney animation studio, so let's make a movie like The Lion King and our classics.'' And they did do that, but in modern times.Frozen is pretty much the definition of a hit and miss. So many great hits, but lots of small misses.1. The Music The music is fantastic, when it needs to. My favorite is Do You Want to Build a Snowman? It's a great song, but I felt like it attempted to be the song 'Married Life' from Up, but with dialog. And it did the job well, but I kinda wished it was longer and added more emotion. Other great songs are Let It Go and both the versions of For The First Time In Forever, however, like I said, the music is great when it needs to. What I mean is, unlike The Lion King, they added songs that were pointless and annoying. An example? The Picker Upper. It's the song that should of just left in the first place. Nobody understands the lyrics, and it's just a plain bad song. Other pointless songs include the Olaf summer song and the Ice Cutting song. The Lion King had all the songs at least have a meaning and helped the plot.2. Plot Notice how I said plot, not script. The story being about a girl with ice powers how make summer a winter wonderland is great. And the twists and turns are also impressive.3. Animation Perfect animation, the dresses, characters, everything pops in beautiful animation.Now let's get into the misses Frozen has, and boy it has a lot.1. Comedy Olaf is pretty much the only source of comedy you'll find in Frozen, unless you like very awkward, and dumb modern comedy. In an animated film, you have two routes, story, and comedy. Free Birds took the comedy path, not having a care in the world about story. Pixar movies, besides Cars 2, go both routes. Frozen, for the most part, goes mostly on the story route, but forgets comedy until Olaf comes on stage.2. Runtime/Script Frozen, really needed to be at least 2 hours, but since this is a kids movie, it's close to an hour and 30 minutes. If this was 2 hours, Frozen might of have the chance to slow down and reveal emotion. As I said in music, Do You Want to Build a Snowman needed to be longer to show what it needed to be. And something that disappointed me greatly was that I was hoping for maybe a scene on how Elsa got her powers, like maybe she was born in ice or something.While Frozen does have its problems, the music and animation really does its possible best, making it an 8/10.","['disney', 'finally', 'come', 'sens', 'say', 'alright', 'pixar', 'go', 'hill', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'let', 'make', 'movie', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'classic', 'modern', 'time', 'frozen', 'pretty', 'much', 'definition', 'hit', 'miss', 'many', 'great', 'hit', 'lot', 'small', 'miss', 'music', 'music', 'fantastic', 'need', 'favorite', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'great', 'song', 'felt', 'like', 'attempt', 'song', 'married', 'life', 'dialog', 'job', 'well', 'kinda', 'wish', 'longer', 'add', 'emotion', 'great', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'version', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'however', 'like', 'say', 'music', 'great', 'need', 'mean', 'unlike', 'lion', 'king', 'add', 'song', 'pointless', 'annoy', 'example', 'picker', 'upper', 'song', 'left', 'first', 'place', 'nobody', 'understands', 'lyric', 'plain', 'bad', 'song', 'pointless', 'song', 'include', 'olaf', 'summer', 'song', 'ice', 'cut', 'song', 'lion', 'king', 'song', 'least', 'meaning', 'help', 'plot', 'plot', 'notice', 'say', 'plot', 'script', 'story', 'girl', 'ice', 'power', 'make', 'summer', 'winter', 'wonderland', 'great', 'twist', 'turn', 'also', 'impressive', 'animation', 'perfect', 'animation', 'dress', 'character', 'everything', 'pop', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'let', 'get', 'miss', 'frozen', 'boy', 'lot', 'comedy', 'olaf', 'pretty', 'much', 'source', 'comedy', 'find', 'frozen', 'unless', 'like', 'awkward', 'dumb', 'modern', 'comedy', 'animate', 'film', 'two', 'route', 'story', 'comedy', 'free', 'bird', 'take', 'comedy', 'path', 'care', 'world', 'story', 'pixar', 'movie', 'besides', 'car', 'go', 'route', 'frozen', 'part', 'go', 'mostly', 'story', 'route', 'forgets', 'comedy', 'olaf', 'come', 'stage', 'runtime', 'script', 'frozen', 'really', 'need', 'least', 'hour', 'since', 'kid', 'movie', 'close', 'hour', 'minute', 'hour', 'frozen', 'might', 'chance', 'slow', 'reveal', 'emotion', 'say', 'music', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'need', 'longer', 'show', 'need', 'something', 'disappointed', 'greatly', 'hop', 'maybe', 'scene', 'elsa', 'get', 'power', 'like', 'maybe', 'born', 'ice', 'something', 'frozen', 'problem', 'music', 'animation', 'really', 'possible', 'best', 'make']","[2, 241, 40, 2864, 35, 2216, 194, 13, 1930, 2, 21, 311, 30, 14, 1, 9, 152, 97, 69, 324, 20, 5, 136, 31, 1585, 234, 271, 61, 25, 234, 84, 601, 271, 58, 58, 253, 99, 189, 59, 202, 45, 25, 11, 155, 9, 448, 11, 895, 79, 1187, 373, 18, 629, 417, 612, 269, 240, 25, 11, 30, 13, 435, 36, 20, 287, 110, 9, 35, 58, 25, 99, 218, 766, 152, 97, 269, 11, 898, 238, 396, 737, 11, 330, 36, 188, 1170, 2696, 475, 915, 65, 11, 898, 11, 349, 32, 205, 11, 33, 723, 11, 152, 97, 11, 250, 672, 135, 52, 52, 692, 35, 52, 395, 12, 76, 33, 24, 14, 205, 105, 1809, 25, 129, 113, 27, 933, 21, 175, 21, 907, 8, 132, 658, 93, 21, 30, 19, 271, 5, 408, 84, 279, 32, 136, 31, 1092, 279, 71, 5, 959, 9, 810, 1157, 324, 279, 38, 3, 42, 1650, 12, 279, 593, 2176, 55, 279, 1347, 293, 126, 12, 194, 1, 877, 1406, 13, 1650, 5, 94, 13, 567, 12, 1650, 3588, 279, 32, 40, 1115, 395, 5, 22, 99, 250, 487, 98, 60, 1, 351, 487, 211, 487, 5, 252, 632, 1065, 528, 240, 35, 58, 59, 202, 45, 99, 612, 78, 99, 89, 476, 1316, 840, 232, 90, 4, 19, 24, 9, 232, 589, 33, 89, 5, 198, 58, 21, 22, 673, 34, 14]"
591,6,"I have no idea why most people really love this movie. 'Frozen' is a typical Disney's princess animation movie that having almost the same formula from others.

The middle of this movie is undeniably interesting, they got me curious what would happen at the end of it. Unfortunately the ending is not what I expected, it's lame and seems to be forced in such big conflicts. The conclusion is just too ordinary for Disney studio.

After I saw that film I was thinking there's no way that most people in this world want to see the film after what I watch, however when many people started talking about how Disney Frozen is good and many people like or love the film, but in my mind, I'm thinking, how?! There's nothing interesting or special about the film, all I see are sisters fighting each other. I never see music entertaining to me, nothing. I don't get why most people those days like it so much? I even watch it the second time 3 years afterward but when I'm halfway through I ended up stop watching the film right there. I'm still confused about how so many people like it so much but I couldn't get the full picture.

596,6,"What was undoubtedly supposed to be the modern Disney classic in the likes of The Lion King, unfortunately, falls somewhat flat. Frozen is of course in many ways a very typical Disney film. Sadly, it never manages to capture the magic that films like The Lion King do. Although it is filled with wonder, as it should be, something about it just doesn't feel right.What surprised me the most, after 7 years since last seeing this, was how much I enjoyed the songs. Although Let It Go became the mega-hit we now know it as, I actually enjoyed the other songs more. They felt very Disney-like and set a wonderful tone from the get-go.Unfortunately, that's where the magic ends. There is really nothing special about anything in Frozen. As expected, the story is very predictable. But that didn't bother me. What bothered me, was that the great Disney films of that past don't suffer from a predictable story. They still manage to create such a wonderful and special experience that you could care less that you know exactly what's going to happen next. Frozen never manages to do that.Another annoyance, be it a relatively small one in the grand scheme of things, is the seemingly compulsory sidekick. What is it about these newer animations that apparently require an annoying side-kick? It is just to sell more merchandise or am I supposed to believe that kids actually like these characters so much that there needs to be one in every animated film. Olaf, the sidekick in Frozen, is just another one to add to the pile of them. I suppose that their purpose is to bring some comedic relief, and perhaps kids do find them funny. But watching these films as an adult, I can't help but be annoyed by them. Especially when they are completely useless. Olaf brings absolutely nothing to this film, and every scene he is in would've worked just as well without him.Enough with me ranting about this film. Because ultimately, Frozen is a decent Disney film. It's nowhere near as good as the Disney films from my childhood, but maybe that's just nostalgia talking. And as far as I've understood, most kids absolutely loved this one. And at the end of the day, that's what matters. These films are aimed at kids, and if adults can enjoy them too, that's just a bonus. I certainly enjoyed this film despite all its flaws. I suppose I was just expecting to feel some of that Disney magic of the past, and sadly I never did.","['undoubtedly', 'suppose', 'modern', 'disney', 'classic', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'unfortunately', 'fall', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'frozen', 'course', 'many', 'way', 'typical', 'disney', 'film', 'sadly', 'never', 'manages', 'capture', 'magic', 'film', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'although', 'fill', 'wonder', 'something', 'feel', 'right', 'surprised', 'year', 'since', 'last', 'see', 'much', 'enjoy', 'song', 'although', 'let', 'go', 'become', 'mega', 'hit', 'know', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'song', 'felt', 'disney', 'like', 'set', 'wonderful', 'tone', 'get', 'go', 'unfortunately', 'magic', 'end', 'really', 'nothing', 'special', 'anything', 'frozen', 'expect', 'story', 'predictable', 'bother', 'bother', 'great', 'disney', 'film', 'past', 'suffer', 'predictable', 'story', 'still', 'manage', 'create', 'wonderful', 'special', 'experience', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'know', 'exactly', 'go', 'happen', 'next', 'frozen', 'never', 'manages', 'another', 'annoyance', 'relatively', 'small', 'one', 'grand', 'scheme', 'thing', 'seemingly', 'compulsory', 'sidekick', 'newer', 'animation', 'apparently', 'require', 'annoy', 'side', 'kick', 'sell', 'merchandise', 'suppose', 'believe', 'kid', 'actually', 'like', 'character', 'much', 'need', 'one', 'every', 'animate', 'film', 'olaf', 'sidekick', 'frozen', 'another', 'one', 'add', 'pile', 'suppose', 'purpose', 'bring', 'comedic', 'relief', 'perhaps', 'kid', 'find', 'funny', 'watch', 'film', 'adult', 'help', 'annoyed', 'especially', 'completely', 'useless', 'olaf', 'brings', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'every', 'scene', 'would', 'work', 'well', 'without', 'enough', 'rant', 'film', 'ultimately', 'frozen', 'decent', 'disney', 'film', 'nowhere', 'near', 'good', 'disney', 'film', 'childhood', 'maybe', 'nostalgia', 'talk', 'far', 'understood', 'kid', 'absolutely', 'love', 'one', 'end', 'day', 'matter', 'film', 'aim', 'kid', 'adult', 'enjoy', 'bonus', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'film', 'despite', 'flaw', 'suppose', 'expect', 'feel', 'disney', 'magic', 'past', 'sadly', 'never']","[1674, 473, 324, 2, 69, 9, 152, 97, 573, 186, 572, 838, 5, 228, 61, 50, 376, 2, 3, 1670, 88, 825, 611, 150, 3, 9, 152, 97, 255, 481, 532, 89, 53, 130, 703, 47, 98, 197, 16, 31, 91, 11, 255, 30, 13, 179, 2255, 234, 56, 103, 91, 11, 155, 2, 9, 144, 215, 627, 19, 13, 573, 150, 41, 22, 156, 316, 212, 5, 131, 12, 331, 864, 864, 25, 2, 3, 276, 888, 331, 12, 68, 857, 134, 215, 316, 334, 54, 293, 321, 56, 522, 13, 290, 418, 5, 88, 825, 102, 4789, 1688, 601, 10, 936, 1467, 43, 1161, 436, 2056, 21, 755, 1364, 238, 387, 1699, 718, 949, 473, 220, 60, 103, 9, 8, 31, 99, 10, 115, 38, 3, 32, 436, 5, 102, 10, 269, 2589, 473, 646, 221, 1043, 297, 578, 60, 71, 85, 23, 3, 147, 135, 1127, 121, 291, 1490, 32, 509, 292, 156, 3, 115, 90, 26, 107, 18, 137, 164, 2865, 3, 941, 5, 546, 2, 3, 801, 449, 17, 2, 3, 466, 232, 1677, 178, 142, 2167, 60, 292, 6, 10, 41, 138, 375, 3, 859, 60, 147, 91, 2055, 442, 91, 3, 313, 386, 473, 131, 53, 2, 150, 276, 1670, 88]"

600,8,"Frozen, in my opinion, is probably the best Disney animated movie not made by Pixar to come out since the Lion King. The Lion King was the peak of Disney animation. After that Disney animated films were on the decline and Pixar took over for a while. However, that could be about to change. If Disney continues to put out movies as good as or better than Frozen then we may have another Disney golden age.Frozen is the story of the Ice Queen but told from a different angle. When you think of the ice queen you think that she is the villain. However, in Frozen she is not evil but more misunderstood, which I did not expect. This story could be really fun or feel really forced. Fortunately this movie was extremely fun, well-paced, well-acted, and well animated. The characters are really fun and relatable.Most of the songs were also good. One of the things I love about this film is that it is a Disney animated film not a Pixar film. Frozen is a Disney 2D animated film in 3D animation. While in 3D animation this film is not a comedy like most of them are. It has much humor in it, but it places focus on the story and the dramatic moments more than humor. Plus it is a musical like the old Disney films, which is a welcome change. I also like how they make fun of past Disney tropes like a prince and princess falling in love instantly without getting to know one another.There are some issues I have with the film, though most are minor. Firstly, I kind of wish this was done in 2D animation. I do not dislike 3D animation, but I do like the 2D style of animation more. Plus, I am so used to pure Disney animated movies like this in 2D that seeing one in 3D did not entirely click with me. That one is more of a personal preference I know.Another problem I have is with the villain. The problem is that they reveal who the main villain is in the third act. To be honest it really comes out of nowhere. Not to mention the villain is very bland. I have seen this villain in many Disney films and even films in general. I get what they were going for with the reveal, but I still did not really care for it and thought it was too out of left field.Overall, Frozen is Disney's best animated films of the decade (maybe two decades) that isn't made by Pixar. It is fun and funny when it wants to be and dark and serious when it needs to be. The characters (save one) are all likable and fun to watch. The effects were amazing and very well done. I do have some gripes but they're really just nitpicks. I recommend going to see this and I highly recommend taking your kids to see this.","['frozen', 'opinion', 'probably', 'best', 'disney', 'animate', 'movie', 'make', 'pixar', 'come', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'lion', 'king', 'peak', 'disney', 'animation', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'decline', 'pixar', 'take', 'however', 'could', 'change', 'disney', 'continue', 'put', 'movie', 'good', 'well', 'frozen', 'may', 'another', 'disney', 'golden', 'age', 'frozen', 'story', 'ice', 'queen', 'told', 'different', 'angle', 'think', 'ice', 'queen', 'think', 'villain', 'however', 'frozen', 'evil', 'misunderstood', 'expect', 'story', 'could', 'really', 'fun', 'feel', 'really', 'force', 'fortunately', 'movie', 'extremely', 'fun', 'well', 'pace', 'well', 'act', 'well', 'animate', 'character', 'really', 'fun', 'relatable', 'song', 'also', 'good', 'one', 'thing', 'love', 'film', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'pixar', 'film', 'frozen', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'animation', 'animation', 'film', 'comedy', 'like', 'much', 'humor', 'place', 'focus', 'story', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'humor', 'plus', 'musical', 'like', 'old', 'disney', 'film', 'welcome', 'change', 'also', 'like', 'make', 'fun', 'past', 'disney', 'trope', 'like', 'prince', 'princess', 'fall', 'love', 'instantly', 'without', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'another', 'issue', 'film', 'though', 'minor', 'firstly', 'kind', 'wish', 'animation', 'dislike', 'animation', 'like', 'style', 'animation', 'plus', 'use', 'pure', 'disney', 'animate', 'movie', 'like', 'see', 'one', 'entirely', 'click', 'one', 'personal', 'preference', 'know', 'another', 'problem', 'villain', 'problem', 'reveal', 'main', 'villain', 'third', 'act', 'honest', 'really', 'come', 'nowhere', 'mention', 'villain', 'bland', 'see', 'villain', 'many', 'disney', 'film', 'even', 'film', 'general', 'get', 'go', 'reveal', 'still', 'really', 'care', 'thought', 'left', 'field', 'overall', 'frozen', 'disney', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'decade', 'maybe', 'two', 'decade', 'make', 'pixar', 'fun', 'funny', 'want', 'dark', 'serious', 'need', 'character', 'save', 'one', 'likable', 'fun', 'watch', 'effect', 'amaze', 'well', 'gripe', 'really', 'nitpicks', 'recommend', 'go', 'see', 'highly', 'recommend', 'take', 'kid', 'see']","[5, 258, 210, 34, 2, 38, 1, 14, 194, 40, 98, 152, 97, 152, 97, 2375, 2, 21, 2, 38, 3, 3171, 194, 55, 110, 54, 209, 2, 647, 196, 1, 17, 18, 5, 171, 102, 2, 796, 139, 5, 12, 33, 49, 511, 140, 2065, 37, 33, 49, 37, 104, 110, 5, 277, 1994, 131, 12, 54, 22, 125, 53, 22, 272, 2192, 1, 423, 125, 18, 564, 18, 112, 18, 38, 8, 22, 125, 884, 11, 27, 17, 10, 43, 6, 3, 2, 38, 3, 194, 3, 5, 2, 38, 3, 21, 21, 3, 279, 9, 31, 222, 188, 261, 12, 1213, 133, 222, 569, 51, 9, 64, 2, 3, 1108, 209, 27, 9, 14, 125, 276, 2, 1032, 9, 82, 29, 186, 6, 1498, 137, 19, 56, 10, 102, 519, 3, 100, 670, 2655, 193, 417, 21, 1116, 21, 9, 355, 21, 569, 158, 724, 2, 38, 1, 9, 16, 10, 1083, 4790, 10, 537, 2798, 56, 102, 198, 104, 198, 528, 119, 104, 715, 112, 742, 22, 40, 801, 348, 104, 811, 16, 104, 61, 2, 3, 28, 3, 623, 19, 13, 528, 68, 22, 293, 92, 330, 4791, 166, 5, 2, 34, 38, 3, 492, 232, 42, 492, 14, 194, 125, 85, 59, 628, 835, 99, 8, 111, 10, 402, 125, 23, 278, 96, 18, 2866, 22, 4792, 262, 13, 16, 472, 262, 55, 60, 16]"

After an accident, Elsa is isolated from the rest of the world in fear of her powers going out of control and is forbidden contact with anyone - including her younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell). Years later, after her parents pass away, Elsa is crowned queen and a party is thrown. All is well, but then Anna, who is upset with being constantly rejected by Elsa all these years, finally confronts Elsa, and accidentally causes Elsa's powers to go berserk and Elsa flees the kingdom in panic, unwittingly setting off an eternal winter everywhere.
Anna must brave the elements, team up with a rough-and-tumble man called Kristoff, his trusty reindeer Sven, and a lovable snowman called Olaf, to find her sister and restore summer.
For quite a few years, I had been putting off watching this movie as I wasn't sure about the magical elements of it - sounded too much like the White Witch and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, in my opinion.
But, earlier this year, I finally decided to borrow it from my library and give it a go, seriously expecting it to be a waste of time.
Boy, was I very wrong.
I love this movie!!!
It is, quite frankly, one of Disney's best animated movies of all time!
The animation is top notch and has serious attention to detail. The acting is very fantastic and everyone is perfectly cast for the roles - especially Kristen Bell, who plays Anna, and Josh Gad, who plays Olaf.
The story was very entertaining and engaging - it grabbed my attention from the very start. Has plenty of twists and turns - nothing is what it seems. The villain is great and perfectly believable - far from cheesy. I don't get why there have been complaints about who the villain turns out to be. With regards to the complaint that we had no idea beforehand, I would say it was done that way to lead us up the garden path, to make it more of a surprise. And they succeeded. Well done and hats off to Disney.
There is nothing wrong with Olaf - he really makes this movie something special. He's cute, adorable, and will steal your heart in a second. Bonus points for the fact that Josh Gad improvised a lot of his lines - his comic timing was absolutely spot-on.
The climax is so good. Amazing, amazing. I'm practically jumping up and down in my seat every time I watch it. Well, with the whole movie, really. Embarrassing, since I'm not a child.
There is not too many songs. In fact, I wish there was more of them. I love each and every one of the songs and have memorized Let It Go and the first First Time In Forever song. Not sure if that is a bad thing or not.
And it's not just for little girls. It's for anyone of any age.
It has great themes of sisterhood and coming of age. Of love, of letting go of your fears.
A true classic and a must watch.","['princess', 'elsa', 'arendelle', 'idina', 'menzel', 'next', 'line', 'throne', 'ice', 'power', 'accident', 'elsa', 'isolated', 'rest', 'world', 'fear', 'power', 'go', 'control', 'forbidden', 'contact', 'anyone', 'include', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'year', 'later', 'parent', 'pas', 'away', 'elsa', 'crown', 'queen', 'party', 'thrown', 'well', 'anna', 'upset', 'constantly', 'reject', 'elsa', 'year', 'finally', 'confronts', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'cause', 'elsa', 'power', 'go', 'berserk', 'elsa', 'flees', 'kingdom', 'panic', 'unwittingly', 'set', 'eternal', 'winter', 'everywhere', 'anna', 'must', 'brave', 'element', 'team', 'rough', 'tumble', 'man', 'call', 'kristoff', 'trusty', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'lovable', 'snowman', 'call', 'olaf', 'find', 'sister', 'restore', 'summer', 'quite', 'year', 'put', 'watch', 'movie', 'sure', 'magical', 'element', 'sound', 'much', 'like', 'white', 'witch', 'lion', 'witch', 'wardrobe', 'opinion', 'earlier', 'year', 'finally', 'decide', 'borrow', 'library', 'give', 'go', 'seriously', 'expect', 'waste', 'time', 'boy', 'wrong', 'love', 'movie', 'quite', 'frankly', 'one', 'disney', 'best', 'animate', 'movie', 'time', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'serious', 'attention', 'detail', 'act', 'fantastic', 'everyone', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'especially', 'kristen', 'bell', 'play', 'anna', 'josh', 'gad', 'play', 'olaf', 'story', 'entertain', 'engage', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'start', 'plenty', 'twist', 'turn', 'nothing', 'seem', 'villain', 'great', 'perfectly', 'believable', 'far', 'cheesy', 'get', 'complaint', 'villain', 'turn', 'regard', 'complaint', 'idea', 'beforehand', 'would', 'say', 'way', 'lead', 'u', 'garden', 'path', 'make', 'surprise', 'succeed', 'well', 'hat', 'disney', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'olaf', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'something', 'special', 'cute', 'adorable', 'steal', 'heart', 'second', 'bonus', 'point', 'fact', 'josh', 'gad', 'improvised', 'lot', 'line', 'comic', 'timing', 'absolutely', 'spot', 'climax', 'good', 'amaze', 'amaze', 'practically', 'jumping', 'seat', 'every', 'time', 'watch', 'well', 'whole', 'movie', 'really', 'embarrass', 'since', 'child', 'many', 'song', 'fact', 'wish', 'love', 'every', 'one', 'song', 'memorize', 'let', 'go', 'first', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'song', 'sure', 'bad', 'thing', 'little', 'girl', 'anyone', 'age', 'great', 'theme', 'sisterhood', 'come', 'age', 'love', 'let', 'go', 'fear', 'true', 'classic', 'must', 'watch']","[29, 4, 199, 141, 116, 418, 213, 952, 33, 24, 480, 4, 782, 303, 126, 187, 24, 13, 128, 3151, 1998, 299, 349, 73, 15, 7, 162, 146, 47, 358, 118, 1204, 101, 4, 722, 49, 1123, 1121, 18, 7, 1320, 1176, 1836, 4, 47, 241, 2867, 4, 300, 328, 4, 24, 13, 4156, 4, 710, 77, 2868, 3221, 144, 310, 105, 879, 7, 236, 335, 401, 486, 2057, 3714, 145, 308, 67, 2263, 151, 181, 726, 45, 308, 32, 71, 15, 1934, 205, 124, 47, 196, 23, 1, 207, 170, 401, 259, 31, 9, 365, 1385, 152, 1385, 4554, 258, 846, 47, 241, 491, 3396, 2366, 57, 13, 667, 131, 644, 20, 408, 280, 6, 1, 124, 1547, 10, 2, 34, 38, 1, 20, 21, 239, 1129, 835, 541, 468, 112, 253, 109, 456, 227, 371, 121, 162, 146, 204, 7, 275, 257, 204, 32, 12, 243, 619, 3701, 541, 120, 727, 129, 113, 156, 75, 104, 25, 456, 1374, 142, 922, 19, 897, 104, 113, 902, 897, 281, 2538, 26, 35, 50, 248, 177, 4796, 1347, 14, 445, 1101, 18, 606, 2, 156, 280, 32, 22, 14, 1, 89, 316, 265, 687, 906, 80, 319, 2055, 117, 201, 275, 257, 3619, 84, 213, 309, 1861, 292, 1278, 792, 17, 96, 96, 1349, 2063, 966, 115, 20, 23, 18, 127, 1, 22, 1989, 98, 70, 61, 11, 201, 417, 6, 115, 10, 11, 3481, 30, 13, 36, 36, 20, 287, 11, 207, 65, 43, 48, 76, 299, 139, 25, 226, 861, 40, 139, 6, 30, 13, 187, 62, 69, 236, 23]"

The music wasn't to great, but the CGI was drop dead gorgeous. The plot, while underdeveloped in some areas, was great in others. Hans, I'm looking at you.But it didn't deserve all the hype that it got. People treated it like it was somehow better than the lion king. When the merchandise was released, it made insane amounts of money, doing better than the lion king in terms of overall box office.I don't think it deserved that. I think it should have looked more like Moana in terms of success. It did good, but not incredibly spectacular.

616,8,"Disney's 53rd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics Series, Frozen, came out this year on November 27. Directed by Chris Buck (Tarzan) and Jennifer Lee (Wreck it Ralph) this computer-animated musical is loosely based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale called The Snow Queen. It illustrates the story of two sisters with a feel similar to the Broadway musical Wicked; the youngest, Anna (Kristen Bell), is very much like Rapunzel from Tangled with her rambunctious lust for life. The oldest sister, Elsa (Idina Menzel), comes across poised and stand offish, though the real reason behind her reserved demeanor and isolation is due to her dangerous icy powers, which grow increasingly deadly whenever Elsa becomes emotional. When long-simmering tensions come to a height at a coronation party, the newly crowned queen fearfully flees the kingdom and unintentionally whips up a snow storm that throws everyone into a glittering white winter. In order to bring back summer and fix the unnatural seasonal change, Anna sets off on a journey to find Elsa and put things to right again, but more importantly to make a reconciliation with a sister she used to be very close to. Along the way she develops a company of friends including a ruggedly handsome mountain man, his pet reindeer, and a cheeky snowman. Here's a film that I hadn't originally planned on watching because of the cheesy trailers and the lack of marketing, which for me was indicative of a sloppily thrown together el cheapo 3D film. The commercial advertising didn't do Frozen any favors focusing too heavily on the kiddish comic relief. I didn't want another Disney road trip movie with quirky reindeer characters, a talking snowman or even a plastic looking Barbie princess squeaking ""Cold, cold cold!"" While what I got wasn't something that deserved a comparison to Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King, it still had all the wholesome whimsical tones that mark a memorable Disney classic. Many film critics also agree that it's possibly one of the best animated musicals since Disney's renaissance era. It received critical acclaim upon its release. I owe the majority of this film's success to the stellar visuals and the mildly heart-warming bond between the two sisters. The strongest playing card of the film is the complexity of Elsa's character and Anna's drive to break through the emotional walls that she has built up makes for sweet story telling. Unfortunately when Elsa runs away and leaves the scene the movie loses it's momentum. The high point of the film comes at this point when Elsa, on her way up a mountain side belts out a power ballad called ""Let it Go."" While singing this Disney version of ""Defying Gravity"", she sculpts a massive ice crystal castle using her ice-bending powers.

617,10,"It is always a smart move to release a Christmas film, if its good it will be watched for many years to come, bad Santa and elf have already become classics for the current generation and frozen maybe another that will be a must watch for years to come.Its typical Disney, similar film to the Rapunzel based film: Tangled, which was released a few years ago. Disney had a rocky spell in my opinion with films such as, the incredibles, bolt amongst a few that haven't hit the heights of classics like The Lion King, Jungle Book etc.The only sad thing I felt was the hilarious trailer in which Olaf features doesn't actually happen in the film, that was a surprise as every time I saw it I was in hysterics. I Wont ruin the storyline at all as its a very enjoyable and quirky film.Its not a classic tale by no means, but its very enjoyable, the characters all have interesting personalities and for the most are very likable. I can see a second film where Olaf is the main character in the future as I see his popularity rivalling that of Despicable Me's Minions.Kids and adults will enjoy it. its the right amount of humour mixed with tension and enjoyable flashes of cute rom-com like moments. Disney have such an amazing range of talent for creating these films, imagination is the most beautiful thing in the world when applied like this.I for one will be adding this to my yearly Christmas watch list. Like the last film Brave it is an awesome and enjoyable romp but still falls slightly short of being a classic in 50 years time like the Little Mermaid and The Jungle Book.Definitely a must see for the kids out there.","['always', 'smart', 'move', 'release', 'christmas', 'film', 'good', 'watch', 'many', 'year', 'come', 'bad', 'santa', 'elf', 'already', 'become', 'classic', 'current', 'generation', 'frozen', 'maybe', 'another', 'must', 'watch', 'year', 'come', 'typical', 'disney', 'similar', 'film', 'rapunzel', 'base', 'film', 'tangle', 'release', 'year', 'ago', 'disney', 'rocky', 'spell', 'opinion', 'film', 'incredibles', 'bolt', 'amongst', 'hit', 'height', 'classic', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'jungle', 'book', 'etc', 'sad', 'thing', 'felt', 'hilarious', 'trailer', 'olaf', 'feature', 'actually', 'happen', 'film', 'surprise', 'every', 'time', 'saw', 'hysteric', 'wont', 'ruin', 'storyline', 'enjoyable', 'quirky', 'film', 'classic', 'tale', 'mean', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'interest', 'personality', 'likable', 'see', 'second', 'film', 'olaf', 'main', 'character', 'future', 'see', 'popularity', 'rival', 'despicable', 'minion', 'kid', 'adult', 'enjoy', 'right', 'amount', 'humour', 'mixed', 'tension', 'enjoyable', 'flash', 'cute', 'rom', 'com', 'like', 'moment', 'disney', 'amaze', 'range', 'talent', 'create', 'film', 'imagination', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'world', 'apply', 'like', 'one', 'add', 'yearly', 'christmas', 'watch', 'list', 'like', 'last', 'film', 'brave', 'awesome', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'still', 'fall', 'slightly', 'short', 'classic', 'year', 'time', 'like', 'little', 'mermaid', 'jungle', 'book', 'definitely', 'must', 'see', 'kid']","[163, 1001, 242, 288, 743, 3, 17, 23, 61, 47, 40, 65, 1941, 397, 179, 69, 1481, 616, 5, 232, 102, 236, 23, 47, 40, 376, 2, 446, 3, 527, 256, 3, 83, 288, 47, 683, 2, 4034, 858, 258, 3, 2214, 1951, 2853, 234, 2118, 69, 9, 152, 97, 1799, 596, 430, 579, 43, 155, 364, 394, 32, 229, 103, 290, 3, 445, 115, 20, 157, 3643, 851, 295, 306, 908, 3, 69, 114, 218, 306, 8, 122, 407, 402, 16, 319, 3, 32, 119, 8, 607, 16, 1872, 1487, 1158, 2781, 60, 147, 91, 130, 624, 732, 1082, 1214, 306, 2209, 265, 3398, 968, 9, 133, 2, 96, 958, 800, 134, 3, 1251, 93, 43, 126, 4803, 9, 10, 269, 743, 23, 550, 9, 197, 3, 335, 338, 306, 3848, 68, 186, 774, 263, 69, 47, 20, 9, 48, 422, 1799, 596, 174, 236, 16, 60]"
618,7,"The story was not super-compelling for me. There just wasn't enough on-screen time to really develop the relationship between the two sisters. I realize screen-time and Arendelle-time are different, just it didn't come through for me. It didn't make me cry. It was a cute enough story, and that's all I can say about it.It was insufficiently racially diverse. Out of all those people in the crowd scenes, they could have made some of them people of color. I mean, it's a fantasy land with magical snow and talking snowmen! Surely, compared to a talking snowman, having some people of color wouldn't be the end of the world??Calling it ""Frozen"" was a pretty bad decision. By giving it a juvenile, humorous title, they've taken away the mysterious, magical, serious feel of a fairy tale. And it does have funny moments, but at its core it's intended to be a heartwarming and emotional story, not a slapstick. Disney needs to quit making titles worse.On that note --- it wasn't The Snow Queen. I'm still waiting for a Snow Queen movie. The Snow Queen is charming in a very different way, a story not about princesses, but about an ordinary girl. Gerda is like Frodo: she loves her quiet life but goes out anyways to rescue her friend. Along the way she matures and grows. I want to see the sorceress with the enchanted garden, and the robber girl, and the passing princess, and the old women who talk about Gerda's inner strength. I want to see the ending that isn't flashy romantic happily ever after, but rather a relief muted by the passage of time.The scenery was very beautiful. Let It Go was a lovely and memorable song. Prince Hans was exceptionally well written.","['story', 'super', 'compelling', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'really', 'develop', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'realize', 'screen', 'time', 'arendelle', 'time', 'different', 'come', 'make', 'cry', 'cute', 'enough', 'story', 'say', 'insufficiently', 'racially', 'diverse', 'people', 'crowd', 'scene', 'could', 'make', 'people', 'color', 'mean', 'fantasy', 'land', 'magical', 'snow', 'talk', 'snowman', 'surely', 'compare', 'talk', 'snowman', 'people', 'color', 'end', 'world', 'call', 'frozen', 'pretty', 'bad', 'decision', 'give', 'juvenile', 'humorous', 'title', 'take', 'away', 'mysterious', 'magical', 'serious', 'feel', 'fairy', 'tale', 'funny', 'moment', 'core', 'intend', 'heartwarming', 'emotional', 'story', 'slapstick', 'disney', 'need', 'quit', 'make', 'title', 'bad', 'note', 'snow', 'queen', 'still', 'wait', 'snow', 'queen', 'movie', 'snow', 'queen', 'charm', 'different', 'way', 'story', 'princess', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'gerda', 'like', 'frodo', 'love', 'quiet', 'life', 'go', 'anyways', 'rescue', 'friend', 'along', 'way', 'matures', 'grows', 'want', 'see', 'sorceress', 'enchant', 'garden', 'robber', 'girl', 'passing', 'princess', 'old', 'woman', 'talk', 'gerda', 'inner', 'strength', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'flashy', 'romantic', 'happily', 'ever', 'rather', 'relief', 'mute', 'passage', 'time', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'let', 'go', 'lovely', 'memorable', 'song', 'prince', 'han', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'write']","[12, 998, 1239, 164, 369, 20, 22, 917, 153, 42, 15, 428, 369, 20, 199, 20, 140, 40, 14, 505, 265, 164, 12, 35, 46, 1150, 90, 54, 14, 46, 651, 218, 545, 757, 170, 39, 178, 45, 960, 350, 178, 45, 46, 651, 41, 126, 308, 5, 136, 65, 758, 57, 3226, 1135, 590, 55, 101, 2085, 170, 835, 53, 219, 114, 85, 133, 1399, 913, 803, 342, 12, 1751, 2, 99, 14, 590, 65, 625, 39, 49, 68, 415, 39, 49, 1, 39, 49, 235, 140, 50, 12, 29, 1420, 76, 1816, 9, 4269, 6, 2459, 79, 13, 1292, 1518, 327, 172, 50, 1291, 59, 16, 2827, 615, 4796, 76, 2792, 29, 64, 251, 178, 1816, 1154, 887, 59, 16, 41, 3499, 393, 795, 81, 191, 297, 3239, 2995, 20, 1217, 93, 30, 13, 765, 268, 11, 82, 44, 2278, 18, 165]"
619,9,Frozen is a loosely based on the Hans Christian Anderson tale The Snow Queen and is a happy tale. Anna seeks to find her sister Elsa who has left the kingdom because of her frozen powers. Along the way she befriends a snowman and a cast of characters. This movie is happy story of finding your way even though fate maybe predestine. The start of the film has a Mickey Mouse cartoon that pulled the voice from Walt Disney himself. It is a nostalgic peek inside the world of past cartoons.

622,7,"Very enjoyable Disney movie about family, loyalty, and personal responsibility with very good songs, a couple of which I can see becoming as popular as other previous Disney movie hits (A Whole New World, A Friend Like Me, etc.). However, the only things that ""took me out"" of the movie were 1) Elsa's transformation (a little too sexy for a kids' movie and even though I'm not a dress designer, I kept thinking what a missed opportunity not to utilize a snowflake-lace design on a much more modest neckline!), 2) the geographical confusion, (where was this supposed to be?

623,-,"When people speak of their favored Disney movies, the big four of the, Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be, mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or, miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being, classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a, full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney, classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best, of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best, animated film of the past few years in my opinion. The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that, has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story, that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying, to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed, adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of, everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is, laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at, others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that, proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are, back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story,, one that is significant. Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful, and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like, you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the, character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step, forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project, need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell, (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring, winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as, heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of, different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make, them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to, and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become, the characters. The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the, texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and, beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I, would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's, Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck, in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it., And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they, are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of, it. So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting, tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy, of the characters especially sweetened Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A, true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid, or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation. FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it, comes in full force here.","['people', 'speak', 'favor', 'disney', 'movie', 'big', 'four', 'renaissance', 'film', 'golden', 'age', 'animation', 'likely', 'mention', 'past', 'decade', 'see', 'disney', 'movie', 'hit', 'miss', 'consider', 'classic', 'forgotten', 'close', 'classic', 'yet', 'frozen', 'change', 'dynamic', 'creates', 'full', 'fledge', 'classic', 'frozen', 'classic', 'disney', 'classic', 'decade', 'could', 'position', 'best', 'disney', 'return', 'root', 'vengeance', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'past', 'year', 'opinion', 'story', 'heart', 'melt', 'fill', 'pure', 'feel', 'heart', 'become', 'staple', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'move', 'story', 'family', 'center', 'unpretentious', 'try', 'portray', 'comedy', 'hit', 'right', 'mark', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'thrill', 'journey', 'make', 'tale', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'exact', 'right', 'amount', 'dare', 'movie', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moment', 'stun', 'provoke', 'others', 'achieve', 'balance', 'true', 'triumph', 'story', 'tell', 'prof', 'exactly', 'disney', 'best', 'prove', 'back', 'produce', 'top', 'quality', 'film', 'affect', 'human', 'story', 'one', 'significant', 'startle', 'stun', 'beautifully', 'envision', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'relevant', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'stun', 'backdrop', 'intricacy', 'like', 'never', 'see', 'environment', 'costume', 'character', 'movement', 'among', 'thing', 'make', 'film', 'gigantic', 'step', 'forward', 'brilliant', 'voice', 'talent', 'breath', 'life', 'project', 'need', 'applaud', 'cast', 'consist', 'kristen', 'bell', 'veronica', 'mar', 'idina', 'menzel', 'wicked', 'among', 'many', 'others', 'bring', 'win', 'charm', 'superior', 'voice', 'act', 'magnificent', 'vocal', 'well', 'heart', 'tale', 'sensational', 'wit', 'humor', 'array', 'different', 'personality', 'emotion', 'triumph', 'fall', 'make', 'interest', 'character', 'people', 'relate', 'best', 'see', 'animation', 'cast', 'fully', 'become', 'character', 'score', 'music', 'perfect', 'score', 'grand', 'sound', 'texture', 'harmony', 'melody', 'class', 'beyond', 'anything', 'attempt', 'animation', 'studio', 'past', 'decade', 'would', 'place', 'song', 'movie', 'enchant', 'true', 'round', 'musical', 'triumph', 'song', 'stuck', 'mind', 'hum', 'even', 'know', 'belting', 'top', 'lung', 'good', 'song', 'progress', 'story', 'essential', 'part', 'meticulously', 'craft', 'breath', 'take', 'animation', 'affect', 'tale', 'bond', 'family', 'romance', 'hilarious', 'wit', 'humor', 'courtesy', 'character', 'especially', 'sweeten', 'olaf', 'heart', 'stop', 'adventure', 'true', 'fairy', 'tale', 'would', 'say', 'could', 'well', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'generation', 'frozen', 'disney', 'magic', 'miss', 'long', 'come', 'full', 'force']","[46, 641, 2005, 2, 1, 106, 784, 465, 3, 796, 139, 21, 1016, 348, 276, 492, 16, 2, 1, 234, 271, 421, 69, 1017, 351, 69, 182, 5, 209, 988, 797, 246, 2297, 69, 5, 69, 2, 69, 492, 54, 1391, 34, 2, 385, 885, 2554, 34, 38, 3, 276, 47, 258, 12, 80, 359, 481, 724, 53, 80, 179, 1704, 34, 2, 1, 242, 12, 72, 649, 2298, 87, 1018, 279, 234, 130, 820, 345, 1184, 326, 1019, 337, 14, 114, 48, 95, 132, 1392, 130, 624, 1110, 1, 190, 798, 133, 315, 1607, 247, 1531, 677, 62, 989, 12, 143, 909, 522, 2, 34, 799, 74, 587, 239, 283, 3, 1076, 515, 12, 10, 1705, 2299, 315, 529, 2104, 910, 439, 1335, 444, 267, 315, 1821, 1947, 9, 88, 16, 1147, 1336, 8, 886, 471, 43, 14, 3, 2105, 668, 571, 523, 86, 800, 990, 79, 1020, 99, 1235, 227, 2106, 162, 146, 1532, 1533, 141, 116, 678, 471, 61, 247, 221, 374, 235, 1185, 86, 112, 935, 821, 18, 80, 114, 1948, 1455, 222, 2107, 140, 407, 240, 989, 186, 14, 122, 8, 46, 785, 34, 16, 21, 227, 822, 179, 8, 223, 58, 175, 223, 936, 259, 1148, 1608, 1186, 1283, 614, 212, 448, 21, 311, 276, 492, 26, 188, 11, 1, 615, 62, 911, 51, 989, 11, 954, 320, 1048, 28, 56, 1949, 239, 2108, 17, 11, 1149, 12, 1337, 94, 2555, 1021, 990, 55, 21, 1076, 114, 482, 72, 363, 364, 1455, 222, 2300, 8, 121, 32, 80, 284, 326, 62, 219, 114, 26, 35, 54, 18, 48, 422, 149, 203, 616, 5, 2, 150, 271, 169, 40, 246, 272]"

All the characters were portrayed in a fun and entertaining way, excluding the protagonist. That was my major issue with this movie, Elsa doesn't give you much to love her for. She is mostly seen as dangerous and isolated, which is not the way a main character should be portrayed. Other than that, the characters were very interesting.

626,10,"I finally saw the film in its entirety tonight ""for the first time in forever"" (although that doesn't really make much sense...), and it lived up to every expectation I had. The story was, of course, fantastic, with the normal types of Disney characters and plot-twists, and the visuals very pleasing to look at, especially, for me, seeing the night skies and the winter wonderland below. However, the big selling point with the film was the soundtrack. The three main leitmotifs I noticed in the film - ""Let it Go"", ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"", and ""For the First Time In Forever"" were repeatedly heard throughout the film, both in lyrics and sweeping throughout the orchestra. And of course these songs were fantastic, the lyrics perfectly matching up with the story. The orchestra rose and fell with whomever was singing at the time, cymbal crashes emphasizing high points, high violins pouring their souls into the music, the French horns particularly creating the majestic tones needed. The opening piano line of ""Let It Go"" (and high keys twinkling within the orchestra as well) captured a feeling of ice and cold as Vivaldi did in his violin concerto for ""Winter"". Christophe Beck scored this magnificent film creating all the clichés of Disney music, but in this case, that's not a bad thing at all. This score, both used for the 'musical' aspect and as incidental music, follows Anna and Elsa's journey throughout the film, and it reminds the audience just what music does to a film, and why it is so important to exist.And this is what a Disney film does to me: it creates a magical experience that truly forces the listener to focus on the music - even when it's just the orchestra playing. By having the orchestra follow the action step-by-step, it engages the audience and invites them to truly have a musical ear while focusing on the story. Some film scores - for example, The Lord of the Rings - have similar ideas, but different approaches of doing so, while others try their best to make the audience focused on the story, rather than the music, and these composers think if you don't hear the music, it's a good sign. After seeing Frozen, I do realize now how important it is to have a good film score, and how important it is people notice these things. Sorry if I'm just gushing on the score, for while it's the aspect I was mainly focusing on as I watched the film, everything else about it was fantastic as well. All of the theatrical aspects are there - the CGI is wonderful, as are the numerous characters and development of them. The symbols are clearly shown, and all in all it's a fairly simple tale that drives its focus on a number of different aspects - isolation, fear, loneliness, and love of family. I agree with all those who say Frozen is an instant classic - for I will always turn to this film in the future. Even 20+ years from now, I will watch the film over and over again, and I will keep picking out every little secret stashed in its score as I build my own. Every day I listen, it will inspire me to keep writing for film music.Oh, and, of course, it will inspire lots of future generations of girls that men aren't that important... as long as you have your sister.","['finally', 'saw', 'film', 'entirety', 'tonight', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'although', 'really', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'live', 'every', 'expectation', 'story', 'course', 'fantastic', 'normal', 'type', 'disney', 'character', 'plot', 'twist', 'visuals', 'please', 'look', 'especially', 'see', 'night', 'sky', 'winter', 'wonderland', 'however', 'big', 'sell', 'point', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'three', 'main', 'leitmotif', 'notice', 'film', 'let', 'go', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'repeatedly', 'heard', 'throughout', 'film', 'lyric', 'sweep', 'throughout', 'orchestra', 'course', 'song', 'fantastic', 'lyric', 'perfectly', 'match', 'story', 'orchestra', 'rise', 'fell', 'whomever', 'sing', 'time', 'cymbal', 'crash', 'emphasize', 'high', 'point', 'high', 'violin', 'pour', 'soul', 'music', 'french', 'horn', 'particularly', 'create', 'majestic', 'tone', 'need', 'opening', 'piano', 'line', 'let', 'go', 'high', 'key', 'twinkle', 'within', 'orchestra', 'well', 'capture', 'feel', 'ice', 'cold', 'vivaldi', 'violin', 'concerto', 'winter', 'christophe', 'beck', 'score', 'magnificent', 'film', 'create', 'clich', 'disney', 'music', 'case', 'bad', 'thing', 'score', 'use', 'musical', 'aspect', 'incidental', 'music', 'follow', 'anna', 'elsa', 'journey', 'throughout', 'film', 'reminds', 'audience', 'music', 'film', 'important', 'exist', 'disney', 'film', 'creates', 'magical', 'experience', 'truly', 'force', 'listener', 'focus', 'music', 'even', 'orchestra', 'play', 'orchestra', 'follow', 'action', 'step', 'step', 'engages', 'audience', 'invite', 'truly', 'musical', 'ear', 'focus', 'story', 'film', 'score', 'example', 'lord', 'ring', 'similar', 'idea', 'different', 'approach', 'others', 'try', 'best', 'make', 'audience', 'focus', 'story', 'rather', 'music', 'composer', 'think', 'hear', 'music', 'good', 'sign', 'see', 'frozen', 'realize', 'important', 'good', 'film', 'score', 'important', 'people', 'notice', 'thing', 'sorry', 'gush', 'score', 'aspect', 'mainly', 'focus', 'watch', 'film', 'everything', 'else', 'fantastic', 'well', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'cgi', 'wonderful', 'numerous', 'character', 'development', 'symbol', 'clearly', 'show', 'fairly', 'simple', 'tale', 'drive', 'focus', 'number', 'different', 'aspect', 'isolation', 'fear', 'loneliness', 'love', 'family', 'agree', 'say', 'frozen', 'instant', 'classic', 'always', 'turn', 'film', 'future', 'even', 'year', 'watch', 'film', 'keep', 'pick', 'every', 'little', 'secret', 'stash', 'score', 'build', 'every', 'day', 'listen', 'inspire', 'keep', 'write', 'film', 'music', 'oh', 'course', 'inspire', 'lot', 'future', 'generation', 'girl', 'men', 'important', 'long', 'sister']","[241, 157, 3, 3835, 2721, 36, 20, 287, 255, 22, 14, 31, 217, 224, 115, 452, 12, 228, 253, 873, 524, 2, 8, 52, 129, 267, 576, 66, 121, 16, 773, 1395, 105, 1809, 110, 106, 718, 117, 3, 225, 433, 119, 4679, 692, 3, 30, 13, 59, 202, 45, 36, 20, 287, 2872, 357, 296, 3, 475, 2083, 296, 2540, 228, 11, 253, 475, 456, 553, 12, 2540, 880, 843, 63, 20, 3859, 2174, 206, 117, 206, 4806, 1074, 58, 2501, 3860, 536, 134, 2457, 627, 99, 631, 213, 30, 13, 206, 1165, 654, 2540, 18, 611, 53, 33, 366, 4806, 105, 1357, 1307, 223, 935, 3, 134, 274, 2, 58, 514, 65, 43, 223, 158, 51, 443, 4776, 58, 378, 7, 4, 337, 296, 3, 1044, 159, 58, 3, 289, 1136, 2, 3, 797, 170, 334, 329, 272, 261, 58, 28, 2540, 204, 2540, 378, 345, 668, 668, 159, 4658, 329, 51, 939, 261, 12, 3, 223, 396, 2993, 2110, 446, 281, 140, 1111, 247, 87, 34, 14, 159, 261, 12, 191, 58, 2873, 37, 568, 58, 17, 1676, 16, 5, 428, 289, 17, 3, 223, 289, 46, 692, 43, 777, 3094, 223, 443, 934, 261, 23, 3, 132, 270, 253, 18, 2389, 443, 555, 215, 1874, 8, 356, 3528, 690, 78, 890, 516, 114, 1192, 261, 184, 140, 443, 600, 187, 1505, 6, 72, 729, 35, 5, 982, 69, 163, 113, 3, 607, 28, 47, 23, 3, 154, 1293, 115, 48, 508, 223, 202, 115, 138, 531, 500, 154, 165, 3, 58, 425, 228, 500, 84, 607, 616, 76, 459, 289, 169, 15]"

Whether that is totally subjective or not, the fact is all these cost-effective and time-saving computer generated works are still being created by the same crews that admire the old classic Disney movies. And if not all, some of the new artists are the ones that have inherited Walt's will. The ""Frozen"" is a great example for why Disney is continuously being recognized as one of the top animation companies in the world. After watching the film, it makes me realize that no companies compose better theme songs that harmonize both the characters and the plot than the Disney. A huge round of applause goes to Visual Effects department and animators for creating such a beautiful kingdom filled with pristine ice and feisty motions by capitalizing high-end technology. What takes me by surprise is how Disney is capable of making us giggle in a timely fashion with an eccentric and yet, a simple sense of humor. Especially the snowman, Olaf, almost steal everyone's thunder by being naturally dopey and naive. But, without the well-developed and emotional relationship between an unearthly beauty of the sorceress, Elsa, and a considerate and sympathetic sister, Anna, the movie would lose Disney's utmost strength which is the storytelling that magically imbues many.

642,7,"Well, for an uninitiated person like me, getting to understand Frozen was pretty difficult, also not having watched Tangled. But since I at least heard about all the infamous Disney Princesses, I suppose this is the ""CGI in the morning"" remix of something. So, obviously things like cuteness, certain craziness and cliché are granted, expected and even appreciated by fans. So while it can break another movie, I guess a Disney Princess movie can be cut some slack.What could be said about actual pros and cons? Well, the movie has surprisingly nonlinear plot. I expected dumber. I am glad that I was disappointed. It also has reason and morale, which I acknowledge way above other things. But I suppose morale is a feature of Disney, at least based on what I remember from childhood. And, with all due disrespect to unnatural cuteness - animation is really brilliant. Modern eye-candy in good sense.One thing, however, that I found totally unbearable and sick - is the singing. I remember the magnitude of singing from Lion King, the quality of Rio, the songlist of Madagascar. Now those are films that you can just listen to over and over and over. But this... I at least am glad there are those who also notice it, but I am nonetheless shocked that some acclaim it as ""standard"" for Disney. This isn't singing, this is... ""barely trying"". Maybe it's also a feature that has to be cut slack for a Disney Princess movie(note that only Princess movie, not just any Disney), but in comparison to other movies - it is a disgrace.And of course things like ""Loldead"" moment in the beginning, ""scalped"" and absolutely clichéd greedy old man, the donkey snowman... Such things just make you hiccup with awkwardness. It's not a big minus, but not contributing either.So it's a fairly good movie, positive and healthy(more or less), but it could've been better if Disney tried to be less... Disney.","['well', 'uninitiated', 'person', 'like', 'get', 'understand', 'frozen', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'also', 'watch', 'tangle', 'since', 'least', 'heard', 'infamous', 'disney', 'princess', 'suppose', 'cgi', 'morning', 'remix', 'something', 'obviously', 'thing', 'like', 'cuteness', 'certain', 'craziness', 'clich', 'grant', 'expect', 'even', 'appreciate', 'fan', 'break', 'another', 'movie', 'guess', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'cut', 'slack', 'could', 'say', 'actual', 'pro', 'con', 'well', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'nonlinear', 'plot', 'expect', 'dumber', 'glad', 'disappointed', 'also', 'reason', 'morale', 'acknowledge', 'way', 'thing', 'suppose', 'morale', 'feature', 'disney', 'least', 'base', 'remember', 'childhood', 'due', 'disrespect', 'unnatural', 'cuteness', 'animation', 'really', 'brilliant', 'modern', 'eye', 'candy', 'good', 'sense', 'one', 'thing', 'however', 'found', 'totally', 'unbearable', 'sick', 'sing', 'remember', 'magnitude', 'sing', 'lion', 'king', 'quality', 'rio', 'songlist', 'madagascar', 'film', 'listen', 'least', 'glad', 'also', 'notice', 'nonetheless', 'shock', 'acclaim', 'standard', 'disney', 'sing', 'barely', 'try', 'maybe', 'also', 'feature', 'cut', 'slack', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'note', 'princess', 'movie', 'disney', 'comparison', 'movie', 'disgrace', 'course', 'thing', 'like', 'loldead', 'moment', 'begin', 'scalp', 'absolutely', 'clich', 'greedy', 'old', 'man', 'donkey', 'snowman', 'thing', 'make', 'hiccup', 'awkwardness', 'big', 'minus', 'contribute', 'either', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'positive', 'healthy', 'less', 'could', 'well', 'disney', 'try', 'less', 'disney']","[18, 441, 9, 19, 216, 5, 136, 1113, 27, 23, 83, 98, 250, 357, 2412, 2, 29, 473, 555, 2476, 89, 613, 43, 9, 1746, 563, 274, 1865, 131, 28, 699, 176, 340, 102, 1, 388, 2, 29, 1, 723, 3360, 54, 35, 815, 1319, 2045, 18, 1, 1179, 52, 131, 2988, 818, 476, 27, 180, 2875, 4040, 50, 43, 473, 2875, 229, 2, 250, 256, 391, 466, 404, 3863, 2433, 1746, 21, 22, 523, 324, 336, 2234, 17, 217, 10, 43, 110, 231, 557, 3238, 2158, 63, 391, 4814, 63, 152, 97, 283, 3, 531, 250, 818, 27, 692, 1792, 666, 1942, 633, 2, 63, 944, 87, 232, 27, 229, 723, 3360, 2, 29, 1, 625, 29, 1, 2, 1126, 1, 2318, 228, 43, 9, 133, 160, 292, 274, 3864, 64, 145, 2733, 45, 43, 14, 2510, 106, 3070, 3416, 353, 890, 17, 1, 503, 2646, 321, 54, 18, 2, 87, 321, 2]"

Don't get me wrong, I thought this film was good but I just felt that there wasn't enough to make the film stand out from all of the other Disney films. Pros: The soundtrack was beautifully crafted and very catchy. Idina Menzel's voice was just filled with spirit and emotion.I personally felt that characters like Olaf and the S'ven stole the show. I mean, who would have thought a little quirky snowman and a Reindeer could steal the spotlight! They were both so adorable and lovable. Cons:Although the graphics were AMAZING, I felt like there was still some detail missing. The graphics made the film looked realistic but I think the background/scenery could have been more vivacious and vibrant to make the scene appear fuller and less empty.The film was personally also very predictable. I'm not going to spoil any specific scenes but from the beginning I already had a feeling on how the movie was going to end.Conclusion: I enjoyed the experience of watching the film more than the film itself. The movie is great for all ages and genders and is also a great movie for families.","['film', 'cute', 'oh', 'funny', 'moment', 'rave', 'expect', 'well', 'get', 'wrong', 'thought', 'film', 'good', 'felt', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'stand', 'disney', 'film', 'pro', 'soundtrack', 'beautifully', 'craft', 'catchy', 'idina', 'menzel', 'voice', 'fill', 'spirit', 'emotion', 'personally', 'felt', 'character', 'like', 'olaf', 'ven', 'stole', 'show', 'mean', 'would', 'thought', 'little', 'quirky', 'snowman', 'reindeer', 'could', 'steal', 'spotlight', 'adorable', 'lovable', 'con', 'although', 'graphic', 'amaze', 'felt', 'like', 'still', 'detail', 'miss', 'graphic', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'realistic', 'think', 'background', 'scenery', 'could', 'vivacious', 'vibrant', 'make', 'scene', 'appear', 'fuller', 'less', 'empty', 'film', 'personally', 'also', 'predictable', 'go', 'spoil', 'specific', 'scene', 'begin', 'already', 'feel', 'movie', 'go', 'end', 'conclusion', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'watch', 'film', 'film', 'movie', 'great', 'age', 'gender', 'also', 'great', 'movie', 'family']","[3, 265, 425, 85, 133, 2224, 131, 18, 19, 280, 92, 3, 17, 155, 164, 14, 3, 361, 2, 3, 1319, 225, 529, 1021, 266, 141, 116, 86, 481, 767, 240, 520, 155, 8, 9, 32, 2217, 78, 218, 26, 92, 48, 908, 45, 151, 54, 906, 2042, 687, 726, 2045, 255, 714, 96, 155, 9, 68, 468, 271, 714, 14, 3, 66, 640, 37, 617, 1217, 54, 4450, 1596, 14, 90, 582, 4815, 321, 1538, 3, 520, 27, 331, 13, 1056, 1586, 90, 160, 397, 53, 1, 13, 41, 734, 91, 334, 23, 3, 3, 1, 25, 139, 1288, 27, 25, 1, 72]"
644,9,"In another highly anticipated Pixar/Disney release we get Frozen. Frozen tells the story of Elsa who is to be queen, but hides a secret that could threaten the entire kingdom. Anna is the only one who can save her and the kingdom with the help of Hans (Fontana), and Olaf (Josh Gad).Frozen was a fantastic movie that I feel is the future of the Disney princess franchise. It has possibly the most memorable and powerful song from any Disney movie and recent history, and it feels like an updated version of the Disney princess that applies to girls today. Many, such as Brave, have tried to find this target and missed the mark. Frozen hits the nail on the head in every way.It's an excellent adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's original tale 'The Snow Queen'. The story is fantastic, the voice acting is superb from all involved, and being a Pixar movie, the visual effects are top notch. I'm sure even those living in tropical climates got a chill viewing the landscapes (especially in 3D).I don't really want to single anyone out in this movie, as all voice actors were at the top of their game and filled their roles effectively. It's rare I see a movie where no one performance seems to carry the film. Idina Menzel as Isla does a fantastic job with the emotion required for the role. This is especially prevalent during her songs. Truly fantastic. Josh Gad does a great job capturing the innocence and magic of Olaf. Fontana, Groff, and Bell are also very effective in their love triangle and all seems to have chemistry. I have a feeling they knew they were working on something special and this carried over into their performances.It's rare I see a movie that's near perfect, but that's what we have here with Frozen. I took off half a point because I think we can do without the cheesy 3D 'pop out' effects, but that is merely a blip and something I know was done for the kids. Go watch this movie NOW! Young OR old!

646,7,"FEW spoilers, not many only to explain key areas! Disney seem to have had a complete make over! And frankly it's not bad! Since they did Tangled they seem to have gone for this wide-eyed girls with floating hair. I do like it, it's very pretty. I'm a classic Disney fan, grew up watching the classics and of course I miss the old type of animation but these things have to move on, they have to develop their techniques. The animation is more life like in the ways of movement, such as fabric and hair.In the case of characters I struggled to see a main character although it was obviously Anna (though they pronounced her name weirdly), but in a way I liked that, you were always seeing a more in depth look at each person. As for endearing characters obviously Olaf was the sweetest! He was a very funny character with a sweet nature, a representation of the two sisters' childhood. As for sisterly love I liked the way Disney took it, a family love not a girl meets boy kinda love and that in the end family matter too. I also loved the ""don't rush a relationship"" lesson cos you never know who the other person is going to be like. And again, family looking out for you! It seems Disney have taken a step back in some ways when they got to Kristoff, almost an chilly Aladdin! He was sweet and in the end was the real prince in shining armour but I think we all figured that out, AND his gallant steed!So overall a new and very successful journey for Disney and I hope to see more different stories again that are not all about love like the classics are (sleeping beauty, snow white, etc. I love them but kids need to know it's not all about finding your true love). Im very happy Disney have decided to take this role and I think maybe its because of the colab with Pixar? They have changed tremendously since working with them.

647,9,"This is a great Disney. Lots of singing (alright maybe a tad bit much) and dancing too. I was surprised by the musical type but it was kind of fun. The other good thing is the morale which for once is modern and all. Finally the visual are great, the ice is just superb, the animation is, of course, top-notch and the voice over is perfect, the casting being wonderfully chosen. And it is sooooooo cute !

648,-,"""Frozen"" will always have a special place in my heart because it was the first film seen by my granddaughter Catrin (one month short of her third birthday). We saw it with her little friend James (just three months older) who was also making his first visit to the cinema. Both sat through all 102 minutes totally transfixed and then at the end cried because they did not want it to finish.This offering from Walt Disney Animation Studios tells the tale of two royal sisters from the kingdom of Arendelle: Queen Elsa who has a power to freeze things that grows uncontrollably, leading her to flee the kingdom, and Princess Anna who is determined to find her sister, while coping with two very different suitors, a crazy reindeer and a talking snowman. The visuals are magical even in 2D (we judged that the 3D version would be sensory overload for a first movie on the big screen) and there are plenty of songs and humour plus a ice monster that had the kids jumping.","['frozen', 'always', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'first', 'film', 'see', 'granddaughter', 'catrin', 'one', 'month', 'short', 'third', 'birthday', 'saw', 'little', 'friend', 'james', 'three', 'month', 'old', 'also', 'make', 'first', 'visit', 'cinema', 'sat', 'minute', 'totally', 'transfixed', 'end', 'cry', 'want', 'finish', 'offering', 'walt', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'tell', 'tale', 'two', 'royal', 'sister', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'queen', 'elsa', 'power', 'freeze', 'thing', 'grows', 'uncontrollably', 'lead', 'flee', 'kingdom', 'princess', 'anna', 'determine', 'find', 'sister', 'cop', 'two', 'different', 'suitor', 'crazy', 'reindeer', 'talk', 'snowman', 'visuals', 'magical', 'even', 'judged', 'version', 'would', 'sensory', 'overload', 'first', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'plenty', 'song', 'humour', 'plus', 'ice', 'monster', 'kid', 'jumping']","[5, 163, 316, 188, 80, 36, 3, 16, 3286, 10, 860, 263, 715, 3263, 157, 48, 327, 4822, 433, 860, 64, 27, 14, 36, 1341, 543, 1196, 211, 557, 41, 505, 59, 855, 1611, 410, 2, 21, 311, 143, 114, 42, 870, 15, 77, 199, 49, 4, 24, 282, 43, 1291, 3832, 248, 1454, 77, 29, 7, 993, 71, 15, 4563, 42, 140, 3248, 1008, 151, 178, 45, 267, 170, 28, 4823, 435, 26, 4824, 36, 1, 106, 369, 727, 11, 732, 569, 33, 495, 60, 2063]"
649,9,"John Lasseter, creative officer at Disney Animation Studios, has done wonders with Disney's animation, returning it to its past glories with movies like Tangled and The Princess and the Frog. While these and Frozen aren't going to win over any Disney-detractors, Lasseter and company have deftly combined the nostalgia of the classics with the sensibilities of today in their latest effort. Frozen is a sweet, fresh, and cool movie that is by far the best animated film of the year, and maybe one of the best period. Based on Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Snow Queen"", Frozen is full of memorable, endearing and complex characters. The relationships between these personalities, specifically between the sisters, are heartbreaking (ala Up) and winning. And in what is sure to be one of the most talked about characters in years, Olaf the snowman caused me to giggle incessantly whenever he was on screen. He is a perfect addition to the Disney's comic relief sidekicks. Working on so many different levels (fantasy, humor, drama, action, adventure, romance), ""Frozen"" is an instant Disney classic. So while the film probably wraps up a bit too neatly too quickly and the morals are somewhat over-explained, all of this is easily overlooked thanks to the great characters, stunning animation (especially in the background characters and ice visuals) and a collection of songs that may be Disney's best since ""Pocahontas"". Funny, bright, and joyous, ""Frozen"" is a fantastic and imaginative addition to the Disney catalogand the studios best since ""Aladdin"".","['john', 'lasseter', 'creative', 'officer', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'wonder', 'disney', 'animation', 'return', 'past', 'glory', 'movie', 'like', 'tangle', 'princess', 'frog', 'frozen', 'go', 'win', 'disney', 'detractor', 'lasseter', 'company', 'deftly', 'combine', 'nostalgia', 'classic', 'sensibility', 'today', 'late', 'effort', 'frozen', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'cool', 'movie', 'far', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'year', 'maybe', 'one', 'best', 'period', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'frozen', 'full', 'memorable', 'endear', 'complex', 'character', 'relationship', 'personality', 'specifically', 'sister', 'heartbreaking', 'ala', 'win', 'sure', 'one', 'talk', 'character', 'year', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'cause', 'giggle', 'incessantly', 'whenever', 'screen', 'perfect', 'addition', 'disney', 'comic', 'relief', 'sidekick', 'work', 'many', 'different', 'level', 'fantasy', 'humor', 'drama', 'action', 'adventure', 'romance', 'frozen', 'instant', 'disney', 'classic', 'film', 'probably', 'wrap', 'bit', 'neatly', 'quickly', 'moral', 'somewhat', 'explain', 'easily', 'overlook', 'thanks', 'great', 'character', 'stun', 'animation', 'especially', 'background', 'character', 'ice', 'visuals', 'collection', 'song', 'may', 'disney', 'best', 'since', 'pocahontas', 'funny', 'bright', 'joyous', 'frozen', 'fantastic', 'imaginative', 'addition', 'disney', 'catalog', 'studio', 'best', 'since', 'aladdin']","[1205, 2046, 1014, 2, 21, 311, 532, 2, 21, 385, 276, 1619, 1, 9, 83, 29, 659, 5, 13, 374, 2, 2046, 789, 4825, 1096, 1677, 69, 2876, 674, 530, 575, 5, 457, 819, 556, 1, 142, 34, 38, 3, 47, 232, 10, 34, 1295, 256, 44, 245, 467, 39, 49, 5, 246, 268, 1478, 771, 8, 153, 407, 1828, 15, 2171, 2749, 374, 207, 10, 178, 8, 47, 32, 45, 328, 1388, 4826, 1267, 369, 175, 1000, 2, 309, 297, 436, 107, 61, 140, 440, 545, 222, 745, 345, 326, 363, 5, 982, 2, 69, 3, 210, 1735, 95, 733, 551, 572, 400, 403, 2247, 1182, 25, 8, 315, 21, 121, 617, 8, 33, 267, 1327, 11, 171, 2, 34, 98, 1646, 85, 1425, 4827, 5, 253, 2194, 1000, 2, 3849, 311, 34, 98, 485]"
650,8,"A little before 2000, Disney began to phase out its animated movie musicals. It wasn't that people stopped wanting enchantment at the movie theater, but rather a cold, hard fiscal decision: the films continued to gross less and less and newer ideas for family entertainment were capturing audience attention and dollars. Undoubtedly, however, Disney wanted back into the musical business, to create a nostalgia market and perhaps re-create the golden years of the early '90s. After the traditionally animated ""Princess and the Frog"" failed to revitalize business for classic fairy tales, Disney took to the story of ""Rapunzel"" and gave it a modern twist, calling it ""Tangled"" and giving in to CGI entirely. Here, it seemed, was the formula for fairy tales in the 21st Century. Confident in its success, Disney took another classic tale in Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" and slapped an adjective title on it to give it a contemporary feel. ""Frozen,"" however, throws ever further back to fairy tale musicals than ""Tangled,"" which tiptoed back into the lyric-laden waters with some help from legendary songster Alan Menken. With ""Frozen,"" Disney has definitely let itself go (yes, that's a pun on the film's biggest track) with a film full of magic and princes and princesses and musical numbers.Anyone who grew up in Disney's animated prime or simply recalls it fondly will feel instant kinship with ""Frozen"" and its dainty, fair-skinned, doe-eyed heroines, charming heroes and beloved animal companions, coming together in a story of family, adventure, danger, betrayal and true love.Princess sisters Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) shared a close bond as children, but when Elsa's magical frozen touch nearly took Anna's life, their parents — the king and queen — vow to isolate and Elsa to control her powers. They also wipe Anna's memory of her sister's magic, so she grows up wondering why Elsa has shut her out. When Elsa comes of age to inherit the throne, the castle finally opens its doors, but Elsa loses control of her powers during the coronation and an eternal frost sets over the entire Scandinavian kingdom of Arendelle. Terrified of what she can do, Elsa banishes herself to the mountains and its up to Anna to find her and a solution to her frozen enchantment.Anna comes in a similar mold to Rapunzel, the beautiful heroine who is a little clumsy and awkward but also wacky and exuberant. She fawns over Prince Hans (Santino Fontana), whom she meets at the coronation and falls for quickly, but she's otherwise full of self- determination and bravery. Elsa is more poised and pragmatic, until she sings the aforementioned ""Let It Go"" and embraces her abilities.The heart of ""Frozen"" is a story of sisterly love and dedication, as well as finding one's courage in the face of great fear, but it of course has all the trappings of a contemporary family film. Disney pulled a good deal of misdirection in the marketing, highlighting Olaf the living snowman (Josh Gad) and the wintery adventure of Anna and her escorts, the ice peddler Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusty reindeer, Sven. Absent was any hint of a mushy love story and singing. But even the commercial ploys of the film surpass expectations. Olaf, for example, is unlike any comic relief character in an animated film that you could think of. He has some running physical gags such as his carrot nose and how his body moves independent of his head, but Gad gives him a completely different sense of humor — some combination of wide-eyed wonder, witty observational humor, cluelessness and more. You can see the influence of screenwriter Jennifer Lee (""Wreck-It Wralph"") in some of the film's humor for sure.Lee co-directed with Chris Buck (""Surf's Up,"" Disney's ""Tarzan""), who knows his stuff in terms of making action-oriented, environmental digital animation. There's lots visually going on in the film between the ice powers and snow-covered action sequences, all of which look exceptional.""Frozen"" does seem to walk a line in the story in terms of being cliché and defying convention. A lot of plot points and outcomes are predictable in spite of a few small twists and the characters, especially Kristoff and Sven, are a little formulaic, with brief moments of originality. On the other hand, for example, there's not a clear, malevolent villain in this movie. There are bad characters, but Disney almost always establishes an evil figurehead. In ""Frozen,"" much of the conflict comes from the characters' fear and how this magic is keeping everyone from being happily ever after. At least that's different. The original songs from ""Book of Mormon"" composer Robert Lopez and wife Kristen Anderson-Lopez don't rival the Menken glory days, but they do go for that style in a few instances (""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"", ""For the First Time in Forever"") in addition to some more modern-sounding Broadway-style tracks (""Love Is An Open Door,"" ""Let It Go""). In terms of where the songs go structurally, a few feel more like interruptions than positive additions, but it's fair to allow some time for Disney to get back in the musical swing of things.Disney has taken a big step forward in making its musical fairy tale brand relevant in the digital age with ""Frozen,"" and though they should exercise a bit of caution before stepping on the accelerator with these kinds of projects, there's no question we could all use this kind of enchantment a bit more regularly.~Steven CThanks for reading!

651,9,"'Frozen' is about a princess who goes on a journey to find her sister, who accidentally uses her ice powers and ends up giving her kingdom an eternal winter. Joined by an ice trader, his best friend, who just so happens to be a reindeer, and a talking snowman, the princess must find her sister and return her to the kingdom before someone else finds her first.'Frozen' is your typical Disney movie. Fantastic music, humour and animation makes the wheels turn for this fantastic joy ride. Kids will adore the colours and characters that are brought before them, and adults will enjoy the humour and the music that they may remember from older Disney films.'Frozen' couldn't have come at a better time. With the year lacking great children's films, 'Frozen' comes out just before the holiday season, which is great marketing for Disney considering how many kids will want anything for Christmas that has to do with 'Frozen'. I recommend adults pick up the soundtrack. It's a fantastic listen as the music is just breathtaking.Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez do a fantastic job bringing this Disney Musical back to what made Disney movies such as Beauty and The Beast and The Little Mermaid amazing. Kristen Bell, who voices Anna and who I've never heard sing before, does a great job keeping up with Broadway star Idina Menzel, who voices Anna's snow queen sister, Elsa. The highlight of the film is Idina Menzel singing the song 'Let It Go'. The emotion and her voice sends shivers down your spine and the scene while she sings it is just absolutely gorgeous to look at. The Demi Lovato version, which plays over the credits, is also very good, but not as good as Idina Menzel.Josh Gad, who voices Olaf The Snowman, does a great job playing the comedic sidekick character. Olaf adds to a long list of fantastic Disney characters that make you laugh. He does a hilarious musical number about a snowman who wants to take part in summer. The last half of the movie hardly had any music, which I would say would be the only disappointment. You have great performers such as Jonathan Groff, who some may know from Glee, and Idina Menzel. I just felt like they should have sang one more musical number.'Frozen' is your typical Disney story about true love, but it's a different kind of true love that made me feel even more touched than a typical Disney love story. The bond between siblings is something most of us can relate to, and throughout the film, you feel the bond between these two sisters. Take your children for a day/night out and go see this film. I guarantee the whole family will love it. Also, try to show up for the short film 'Get A Horse', which is a short film staring Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The short film brings back the old school Mickey shorts and gives a modern look to them. It's something you don't want to miss.Grade: A","['frozen', 'princess', 'go', 'journey', 'find', 'sister', 'accidentally', 'us', 'ice', 'power', 'end', 'give', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'join', 'ice', 'trader', 'best', 'friend', 'happens', 'reindeer', 'talk', 'snowman', 'princess', 'must', 'find', 'sister', 'return', 'kingdom', 'someone', 'else', 'find', 'first', 'frozen', 'typical', 'disney', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'music', 'humour', 'animation', 'make', 'wheel', 'turn', 'fantastic', 'joy', 'ride', 'kid', 'adore', 'colour', 'character', 'brought', 'adult', 'enjoy', 'humour', 'music', 'may', 'remember', 'old', 'disney', 'film', 'frozen', 'come', 'well', 'time', 'year', 'lack', 'great', 'child', 'film', 'frozen', 'come', 'holiday', 'season', 'great', 'marketing', 'disney', 'consider', 'many', 'kid', 'want', 'anything', 'christmas', 'frozen', 'recommend', 'adult', 'pick', 'soundtrack', 'fantastic', 'listen', 'music', 'breathtaking', 'robert', 'lopez', 'kristen', 'anderson', 'lopez', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bring', 'disney', 'musical', 'back', 'make', 'disney', 'movie', 'beauty', 'beast', 'little', 'mermaid', 'amaze', 'kristen', 'bell', 'voice', 'anna', 'never', 'heard', 'sing', 'great', 'job', 'keep', 'broadway', 'star', 'idina', 'menzel', 'voice', 'anna', 'snow', 'queen', 'sister', 'elsa', 'highlight', 'film', 'idina', 'menzel', 'sing', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'emotion', 'voice', 'sends', 'shiver', 'spine', 'scene', 'sings', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'demi', 'lovato', 'version', 'play', 'credit', 'also', 'good', 'good', 'idina', 'menzel', 'josh', 'gad', 'voice', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'great', 'job', 'play', 'comedic', 'sidekick', 'character', 'olaf', 'add', 'long', 'list', 'fantastic', 'disney', 'character', 'make', 'laugh', 'hilarious', 'musical', 'number', 'snowman', 'want', 'take', 'part', 'summer', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'hardly', 'music', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'disappointment', 'great', 'performer', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'may', 'know', 'glee', 'idina', 'menzel', 'felt', 'like', 'sang', 'one', 'musical', 'number', 'frozen', 'typical', 'disney', 'story', 'true', 'love', 'different', 'kind', 'true', 'love', 'make', 'feel', 'even', 'touch', 'typical', 'disney', 'love', 'story', 'bond', 'sibling', 'something', 'u', 'relate', 'throughout', 'film', 'feel', 'bond', 'two', 'sister', 'take', 'child', 'day', 'night', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'guarantee', 'whole', 'family', 'love', 'also', 'try', 'show', 'short', 'film', 'get', 'horse', 'short', 'film', 'star', 'mickey', 'minnie', 'mouse', 'short', 'film', 'brings', 'back', 'old', 'school', 'mickey', 'short', 'give', 'modern', 'look', 'something', 'want', 'miss', 'grade']","[5, 29, 13, 337, 71, 15, 300, 919, 33, 24, 41, 57, 77, 310, 105, 813, 33, 1756, 34, 327, 591, 151, 178, 45, 29, 236, 71, 15, 385, 77, 304, 270, 71, 36, 5, 376, 2, 1, 253, 58, 732, 21, 14, 3868, 113, 253, 738, 1305, 60, 1190, 1452, 8, 599, 147, 91, 732, 58, 171, 391, 64, 2, 3, 5, 40, 18, 20, 47, 273, 25, 70, 3, 5, 40, 1039, 1040, 25, 1387, 2, 421, 61, 60, 59, 212, 743, 5, 262, 147, 1293, 225, 253, 531, 58, 905, 1421, 928, 162, 467, 928, 253, 373, 221, 2, 51, 74, 14, 2, 1, 149, 203, 48, 422, 96, 162, 146, 86, 7, 88, 357, 63, 25, 373, 154, 411, 249, 141, 116, 86, 7, 39, 49, 15, 4, 1358, 3, 141, 116, 63, 11, 30, 13, 240, 86, 2086, 3288, 4041, 90, 794, 292, 444, 66, 1381, 1382, 435, 204, 662, 27, 17, 17, 141, 116, 275, 257, 86, 32, 45, 25, 373, 204, 1043, 436, 8, 32, 269, 169, 550, 253, 2, 8, 14, 190, 364, 51, 184, 45, 59, 55, 94, 205, 197, 346, 1, 976, 58, 26, 35, 26, 1038, 25, 455, 377, 171, 56, 1548, 141, 116, 155, 9, 1142, 10, 51, 184, 5, 376, 2, 12, 62, 6, 140, 193, 62, 6, 14, 53, 28, 260, 376, 2, 6, 12, 482, 409, 89, 177, 785, 296, 3, 53, 482, 42, 15, 55, 70, 138, 773, 13, 16, 3, 3255, 127, 72, 6, 27, 87, 78, 263, 3, 19, 1015, 263, 3, 249, 850, 3158, 707, 263, 3, 509, 74, 64, 923, 850, 263, 57, 324, 66, 89, 59, 271, 1552]"

657,-,"Love is shown in this movie through the acts of the characters and the relationship between Anna and Elsa. They find out a lot about love not only from each other but from other people along the way. I think that is an important message to learn because we learn love from our family and friends too as well as ourselves. That is why this is such a great movie. Frozen has a powerful message in it and it is cute! According to IMDb.com, the award-winning Walt Disney movie and computer animated musical film Frozen, won an Oscar nominee for the best animated feature film of the year. It also earned an award for having the best original song, ""Let it Go"", along with many other awards. Among Frozen being an Academy Award winner, there are also many different reasons it is a great movie. It is about love between family and people she meets along the way and that's what makes Frozen uniquely different and better than the other Disney princess movies, in my opinion. This is a phenomenal movie also because the audience is for all ages, kids to adults, any age is guaranteed to enjoy this movie! The actors in this movie make for great personalities and a great story. Kristen Bell is a great actress and singer who plays the voice of Anna, who is a very daring and determined girl who try's everything to save her sister. This is important to the theme of the film because Anna is trying to find an act of true love and her fearlessness and determination makes her unstoppable. Josh Gad is an actor who plays Olaf. Olaf is portrayed as a very friendly, happy snowman which makes the movie even more cute! This also relates to the film because Olaf's friendliness and being outgoing helps Anna along her journey. If it wasn't for Olaf, Anna wouldn't have been able to find Elsa or give true love a meaning. Jonathan Groff plays the voice of Kristoff, who is an outdoorsman that helps Anna along in her journey. Kristoff being the outgoing, friendly guy was important because he stuck by Anna's side the whole journey and made supplies so they could get to Elsa. Idina Menzel plays the voice of Elsa, the queen of Arrendelle, as a fearful and reserved princess. This is important to the theme because it creates a problem in the plot and makes it very interesting and gives Anna a purpose in the movie. The directors of this movie are Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. This movie is about princess Anna trying to save Arrendelle from a never-ending winter, but in order to do that she needs to find her sister. Elsa sets off a never-ending winter from her magical powers coming out when she was upset. On Anna's journey, she meets a guy that isn't good for her. She thinks she finds the meaning of true love but Hans turns against Anna and shuts her out because of Elsa's powers. Anna meets Kristoff, he stayed by her side the whole journey and helped her on her way to find her sister, Elsa. On their way, they also met another important character, Olaf. Olaf showed Anna what true love was. Olaf led Anna to Elsa's castle and Elsa's magical powers froze Anna's heart, an act of true love would be the thing that unthawed Anna's heart. Love is portrayed in many ways in this film. It has a strong message throughout the film and that is what I like about it a lot. One way it is portrayed is by Kristoff. He is by Anna's side the whole journey and when Elsa froze Anna's heart, Kristoff was there right by her side making sure she was okay. Another way love was portrayed was by Olaf. He gives love a whole different meaning. He explains love is ""when you put someone else's needs before yours"". He stood with Anna by the fire waiting for her to unthaw even if that meant he melt because he said ""some people are worth melting for"". He also stood by Anna's side and helped her find Elsa when they met. Love is portrayed between the sisters a lot. Anna always wanted to be close with her sister, but Elsa shut her out because she was scared she would see her magical powers. When Elsa left Arendelle after she set off the winter, Anna was leaving shortly after determined to find her sister. Another way their relationship shows love is by when Prince Hans was about to kill Elsa, Anna seen Hans going towards Elsa and intercepted his sword before it hit Elsa, as she was doing that Anna froze into solid ice. Elsa came running over to her after that happened just feeling terrible for what she did. Anna's sacrifice to become frozen by saving Elsa from getting killed by Prince Hans was an act of true love and that is why her heart unfroze. This film is not only one children can enjoy but adults too! It has a great message about love portrayed in it that adults can recognize by the relationships created in the movie! Kristoff, Olaf, Anna and Elsa all discovered what true love was throughout their journey. Without a doubt this movie will keep you engaged every second; there is never a dull moment. You will see amazing visual animations and watch the characters as they discover the strength within themselves. The actors and the characters in the movie keep you entertained because they all have different personalities and characteristics, from happy friendly Olaf, to reserved and fearful Elsa to fearful and determined Anna. I personally enjoyed this movie very much so and would highly recommend it to any age group!","['love', 'show', 'movie', 'act', 'character', 'relationship', 'anna', 'elsa', 'find', 'lot', 'love',

658,-,"Packed with singalong songs, eye-popping visuals & presenting a wonderful story of sisterhood, Frozen is another worthy animation out of Disney canon & presents this legendary animation studio doing what it does better than anyone else; a fairy-tale musical. The film tells the story of Anna, an optimistic, cheerful & lively princess who sets off on a journey along with a rugged mountain man, his reindeer pet & a wicked snowman to find & bring back her estranged sister, Elsa, whose magical powers, which she has never been able to control, have brought her entire kingdom under an eternal winter spell.Even though there are minor moments of silliness in the story where it felt like the film is trying too hard to be funny, the story & script still manage to deliver for the most part. It features a dynamic set of characters & relationships we can invest our emotions in, is brilliantly voiced by its cast, boasts a wonderful score accompanied by even more amazing songs and is enveloped with an astonishing beauty thanks to its dazzling visuals. Overall, Frozen is arguably the best animated film of the year, one of the best animated musicals to come out in a long time & marks a third consecutive year when Disney has outclassed Pixar. Definitely worth a watch.","['packed', 'singalong', 'song', 'eye', 'pop', 'visuals', 'present', 'wonderful', 'story', 'sisterhood', 'frozen', 'another', 'worthy', 'animation', 'disney', 'canon', 'present', 'legendary', 'animation', 'studio', 'well', 'anyone', 'else', 'fairy', 'tale', 'musical', 'film', 'tell', 'story', 'anna', 'optimistic', 'cheerful', 'lively', 'princess', 'set', 'journey', 'along', 'rugged', 'mountain', 'man', 'reindeer', 'pet', 'wicked', 'snowman', 'find', 'bring', 'back', 'estrange', 'sister', 'elsa', 'whose', 'magical', 'power', 'never', 'able', 'control', 'brought', 'entire', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'spell', 'even', 'though', 'minor', 'moment', 'silliness', 'story', 'felt', 'like', 'film', 'try', 'hard', 'funny', 'story', 'script', 'still', 'manage', 'deliver', 'part', 'feature', 'dynamic', 'set', 'character', 'relationship', 'invest', 'emotion', 'brilliantly', 'voiced', 'cast', 'boast', 'wonderful', 'score', 'accompany', 'even', 'amaze', 'song', 'envelop', 'astonish', 'beauty', 'thanks', 'dazzle', 'visuals', 'overall', 'frozen', 'arguably', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'year', 'one', 'best', 'animate', 'musical', 'come', 'long', 'time', 'mark', 'third', 'consecutive', 'year', 'disney', 'outclass', 'pixar', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch']","[1184, 4837, 11, 336, 658, 267, 663, 215, 12, 861, 5, 102, 790, 21, 2, 1541, 663, 2426, 21, 311, 18, 299, 270, 219, 114, 51, 3, 143, 12, 7, 1268, 1638, 1559, 29, 144, 337, 172, 1371, 214, 145, 151, 983, 678, 45, 71, 221, 74, 1747, 15, 4, 620, 170, 24, 88, 294, 128, 599, 264, 77, 310, 105, 858, 28, 100, 670, 133, 4479, 12, 155, 9, 3, 87, 307, 85, 12, 395, 68, 857, 1050, 94, 229, 988, 144, 8, 153, 2478, 240, 1849, 521, 227, 4371, 215, 223, 1472, 28, 96, 11, 1811, 149, 1182, 1786, 267, 166, 5, 1390, 34, 38, 3, 47, 10, 34, 38, 51, 40, 169, 20, 820, 715, 47, 2, 4457, 194, 174, 254, 23]"
659,7,"Frozen is a fantasy musical movie that features Elsa who has supernatural powers through which she can freeze anything that she desires. She does not have complete control over her overwhelming powers but manages to keep it in check by wearing gloves. Elsa is about to be coronated but upon the discovery of her hidden powers, she is labeled as a freak which forces her to leave the castle and escape towards the mountain.Her sister Anna who believes in true love sets out to bring her maligned sister Elsa back. The plot is clichéd and is quite predictable at times. Even though the animation is breathtaking, the story leaves a lot to be desired as a little more inventiveness is expected from Disney.The primary problem with this movie is that it is too childish and it can be painstaking to watch for most adults. If you compare this movie to any respectable Pixar movie, it pales in comparison as the latter always makes films that are enjoyable for all age groups. The magical tale is filled with predictable occurrences which take away the excitement and it makes the climax much less tense. Frozen will likely be popular with kids but will be hard to sell to others due to the overly optimistic tone. The songs are good as well with 'Let It Go' being the best of the lot. A good movie that does not offer anything new in this genre.","['frozen', 'fantasy', 'musical', 'movie', 'feature', 'elsa', 'supernatural', 'power', 'freeze', 'anything', 'desire', 'complete', 'control', 'overwhelm', 'power', 'manages', 'keep', 'check', 'wear', 'glove', 'elsa', 'coronate', 'upon', 'discovery', 'hidden', 'power', 'label', 'freak', 'force', 'leave', 'castle', 'escape', 'towards', 'mountain', 'sister', 'anna', 'believe', 'true', 'love', 'set', 'bring', 'malign', 'sister', 'elsa', 'back', 'plot', 'clich', 'quite', 'predictable', 'time', 'even', 'though', 'animation', 'breathtaking', 'story', 'leaf', 'lot', 'desire', 'little', 'inventiveness', 'expect', 'disney', 'primary', 'problem', 'movie', 'childish', 'painstaking', 'watch', 'adult', 'compare', 'movie', 'respectable', 'pixar', 'movie', 'pale', 'comparison', 'latter', 'always', 'make', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'age', 'group', 'magical', 'tale', 'fill', 'predictable', 'occurrence', 'take', 'away', 'excitement', 'make', 'climax', 'much', 'less', 'tense', 'frozen', 'likely', 'popular', 'kid', 'hard', 'sell', 'others', 'due', 'overly', 'optimistic', 'tone', 'song', 'good', 'well', 'let', 'go', 'best', 'lot', 'good', 'movie', 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'genre']","[5, 545, 51, 1, 229, 4, 3222, 24, 282, 212, 1070, 656, 128, 2587, 24, 825, 154, 1310, 1494, 1759, 4, 3871, 554, 2647, 994, 24, 2233, 1160, 272, 322, 168, 950, 538, 214, 15, 7, 220, 62, 6, 144, 221, 15, 4, 74, 52, 274, 124, 331, 20, 28, 100, 21, 905, 12, 586, 84, 1070, 48, 131, 2, 1757, 198, 1, 1156, 23, 147, 350, 1, 194, 1, 2616, 1126, 955, 163, 14, 3, 306, 139, 849, 170, 114, 481, 331, 55, 101, 1871, 14, 792, 31, 321, 3276, 5, 1016, 559, 60, 307, 718, 247, 404, 1200, 1268, 627, 11, 17, 18, 30, 13, 34, 84, 17, 1, 705, 212, 108, 768]"

To me, it's not the best (not like The Lion King or the classics that I grew up with), but Frozen will be a great addition to the new generation's list of classics.Although a great family movie, I had mixed feelings about it because it was highly focused on girls. It's not as suitable for a more robust and wide range of viewers, but for girls, this movie would be great entertainment and fun. The characters were great, the story was good (albeit predictable), and a couple of the songs were memorable.

This movie has the very same feel and a very beautiful story with a very mature twist, adults will learn from it a very deep meaning presented in a very simple way, that's typical Disney.About animation i would say it was awesome very well researched the rhythm of the snow the castles(pretty much like the Disney castle) lightning was amazing, Characters looked mature and yet had a soft feel, once again both for adults and kids(very well put). Sound effects would surely give a feel of soft snow and i believe somewhere you will shiver if you are totally immersed in the movie.There were a few scenes which i didn't like and i thought were too fast and needed details a few more added minutes would be nice to put a bit more feel to those scenes. And the dressing of one particular character and the way she walked i felt it was little seductive, or may be its just me perhaps others would not mind it.Overall a very nice simple and beautiful story(although a little bit in haste) must watch with the whole family and be ready for the one epic scene with a epic twist.","['thought', 'disney', 'lose', 'classic', 'theme', 'cartoon', 'beautiful', 'rhythmic', 'yet', 'meaningful', 'song', 'movie', 'land', 'start', 'watch', 'soon', 'first', 'song', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'old', 'disney', 'classic', 'movie', 'feel', 'beautiful', 'story', 'mature', 'twist', 'adult', 'learn', 'deep', 'meaning', 'present', 'simple', 'way', 'typical', 'disney', 'animation', 'would', 'say', 'awesome', 'well', 'research', 'rhythm', 'snow', 'castle', 'pretty', 'much', 'like', 'disney', 'castle', 'lightning', 'amaze', 'character', 'look', 'mature', 'yet', 'soft', 'feel', 'adult', 'kid', 'well', 'put', 'sound', 'effect', 'would', 'surely', 'give', 'feel', 'soft', 'snow', 'believe', 'somewhere', 'shiver', 'totally', 'immerse', 'movie', 'scene', 'like', 'thought', 'fast', 'need', 'detail', 'add', 'minute', 'would', 'nice', 'put', 'bit', 'feel', 'scene', 'dress', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'way', 'walk', 'felt', 'little', 'seductive', 'may', 'perhaps', 'others', 'would', 'mind', 'overall', 'nice', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'story', 'although', 'little', 'bit', 'haste', 'must', 'watch', 'whole', 'family', 'ready', 'one', 'epic', 'scene', 'epic', 'twist']","[92, 2, 489, 69, 226, 314, 93, 4214, 182, 1514, 11, 1, 757, 120, 23, 580, 36, 11, 40, 74, 20, 64, 2, 69, 1, 53, 93, 12, 1022, 129, 147, 347, 574, 672, 663, 516, 50, 376, 2, 21, 26, 35, 338, 18, 3027, 2526, 39, 168, 136, 31, 9, 2, 168, 4839, 96, 8, 66, 1022, 182, 1680, 53, 147, 60, 18, 196, 259, 278, 26, 960, 57, 53, 1680, 39, 220, 1867, 3288, 557, 3014, 1, 90, 9, 92, 780, 99, 468, 269, 211, 26, 192, 196, 95, 53, 90, 907, 10, 650, 8, 50, 669, 155, 48, 171, 578, 247, 26, 320, 166, 192, 516, 93, 12, 255, 48, 95, 4572, 236, 23, 127, 72, 1289, 10, 566, 90, 566, 129]"
662,10,"By now, if you aren't a three-year-old – in which case I would be puzzled to see you reading this –, you know what to bargain for when watching a Disney production: ravishing animations, a feel good story teaching morals, more or less fun for the whole family, but also a rather unoriginal script abounding with clichés. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee's Frozen preserves the modus operandi, but is one of the most exciting and entertaining features the film studio has forged in recent years nevertheless. This also applies for the music incorporated in the 102-minute-long retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, led by the lovely ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"", the comical ""In Summer"", and, of course, the film's powerful flagship ""Let It Go"", yet getting slightly hoary and tedious during other numbers. For a one- time view, the breathers in quality, such as a ridiculous stone troll family, a strained twist in the final act, or the cloying 'act of true love' stepping in as a deus ex machina, are pardonable due to an excellent voice cast and plenty genuine laughs for the young and the old. However, Frozen will hardly go down as a Disney classic in view of all these flaws.If you seek a good family film, the men and women at Disney are who you can bet on to deliver and with Frozen, they've found the right mixture of fun, romance, and peril yet again.

There was a lot of hype before its release, so I was more and more interested in seeing it. When I went to the cinema, I was ready to watch a movie in which I could give 9 or 10 out of 10. But it did not meet me expectations. There are both positive and negative aspects of this film.On the one hand, the special effects were really good and the 3D was perfect. The characters were cute, especially Olaf, who made the film better and funnier. Another thing that should be mentioned is that the movie carries strong messages. Finally, the soundtrack and generally the music were original.On the other hand, the plot was not very appealing. Moreover, the times when the film was boring were not few. I was very disappointed because of the fact that I could predict what was about to happen. Finally, the villain was not really special, actually he/she was totally uninteresting. To sum up, Frozen is a cute and nice film, but it is overrated and overestimated. Personally, I believe that having won lots of awards is not really fair.","['first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'thought', 'frozen', 'go', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'see', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'watch', 'lot', 'hype', 'release', 'interested', 'see', 'go', 'cinema', 'ready', 'watch', 'movie', 'could', 'give', 'meet', 'expectation', 'positive', 'negative', 'aspect', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'special', 'effect', 'really', 'good', 'perfect', 'character', 'cute', 'especially', 'olaf', 'make', 'film', 'well', 'funnier', 'another', 'thing', 'mention', 'movie', 'carry', 'strong', 'message', 'finally', 'soundtrack', 'generally', 'music', 'original', 'hand', 'plot', 'appeal', 'moreover', 'time', 'film', 'boring', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'could', 'predict', 'happen', 'finally', 'villain', 'really', 'special', 'actually', 'totally', 'uninteresting', 'sum', 'frozen', 'cute', 'nice', 'film', 'overrate', 'overestimate', 'personally', 'believe', 'lot', 'award', 'really', 'fair']","[36, 157, 394, 92, 5, 13, 10, 34, 3, 81, 16, 22, 66, 571, 23, 84, 406, 288, 946, 16, 13, 543, 1289, 23, 1, 54, 57, 244, 452, 503, 761, 443, 3, 10, 323, 316, 278, 22, 17, 175, 8, 265, 121, 32, 14, 3, 18, 1850, 102, 43, 348, 1, 853, 167, 185, 241, 225, 1004, 58, 230, 323, 52, 484, 2091, 20, 3, 370, 476, 201, 54, 2392, 290, 241, 104, 22, 316, 103, 557, 2730, 1404, 5, 265, 192, 3, 426, 520, 220, 84, 469, 22, 1257]"

667,6,"I wanted to see a movie a few days ago, and my mom did too. So I took her to a theater and she wanted to see Frozen, because she heard from a friend that it was really good. I wanted to see Saving Mr. Banks, but whatever. As I went into the theater, I had a hunch that it was going to be a girlie princess movie. Well, I was right. Except for the exception of maybe 5 scenes, the movie was a complete girl movie. OK, maybe that is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it was fairly girlie. I am a guy, so, you know. I decided that I wouldn't make a big deal out of it, so I kept watching it. I am glad I did. I enjoyed because my mom enjoyed it so much, and because there were a few good laughs. The movie was very good for a princess movie, and I'm not ashamed to say it. Olaf was hilarious, and I loved every scene he was in. So, if you go see the movie and don't like it, wait until Olaf comes in and maybe you will like it a bit more Sometimes, I was thinking that the movie would have been a little better if there wasn't so many songs, because I counted, and there were about 9-11 songs. Some of them catchy, some of them not. If there were only, maybe, 5 songs, that would have made the movie a little better, I think. My mom thought it was good, so I was happy. The acting was superb, and I don't say that lightly. That was one of the reasons I gave this a 6. The movie's sense of humor was a little bit sophisticated at times, and I enjoyed those parts, and sometimes it was just stupid. The humor, I mean. Like I said in the summary, I usually don't like musicals at all, but this was actually pretty good for a musical. I enjoyed about 4 of the songs, and all of the others I didn't think were needed. The story has 2 different sides to it. There is the side that is completely used up already, where a girl falls in love then figures out it was not true and then falls in love with the guy raised in the cold and the mountains who treats her not so good and then eventually they end up falling in love somehow due to something really confusing that could have been simplified. I hope that wasn't a spoiler because you should have seen that coming before you started watching it. Then there is the other side of the story that hasn't been used that has magic powers and a talking snowman and a bunch of other things I can't say without it being a spoiler. Overall I did like this movie, but just not enough to give it higher than a 6. It's pretty much like a movie that you didn't mind seeing, but wouldn't see it again by yourself. If you were to see it with a friend, maybe. I think you would enjoy it a lot more than I did if you musicals, because there is an abundance of music and singing in this movie. Also, I would recommend it if you like fairy princess movies. OK, maybe not FAIRY princess movies, but princess movies. Or animation movies with romance, for that matter. t is most likely targeted to 4-11 year old girls, but there was the exception of some old guys seeing it (old meaning about 30). Another reason I kind of liked this movie is that there was a really tough guy with a leather jacket and boots laughing at all of the jokes really loud. He seemed like he enjoyed the movie. Anyway, I do recommend this movie to you if you like princesses, romance, well, a little bit of it, animation, or you want to take a little kid to watch the movie. Hope you found this review helpful.

Especially for girls, the dresses worn by both characters are awesome.The cinematography is pretty good, however the male lead could have been given more time on screen and dialogues.The story plot is however the only slightly predictable one but it is expected for movies having a moral ending.On the whole, a highly recommended movie especially for parents having two or more children (or planning the same).","['indeed', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'frozen', 'hype', 'around', 'movie', 'excellent', 'promoter', 'love', 'sibling', 'highly', 'recommend', 'parent', 'kid', 'interest', 'thing', 'movie', 'versatile', 'funny', 'character', 'one', 'sister', 'even', 'though', 'similar', 'sacrifice', 'emotion', 'sake', 'little', 'sister', 'dialogue', 'entire', 'movie', 'pretty', 'clear', 'understandable', 'even', 'child', 'song', 'beautifully', 'compose', 'catch', 'tone', 'especially', 'girl', 'dress', 'worn', 'character', 'awesome', 'cinematography', 'pretty', 'good', 'however', 'male', 'lead', 'could', 'give', 'time', 'screen', 'dialogue', 'story', 'plot', 'however', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'one', 'expect', 'movie', 'moral', 'end', 'whole', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'especially', 'parent', 'two', 'child', 'planning']","[826, 2119, 23, 5, 406, 200, 1, 298, 6, 409, 472, 262, 118, 60, 122, 43, 1, 85, 8, 10, 15, 28, 100, 446, 635, 240, 1105, 48, 15, 719, 264, 1, 136, 871, 2230, 28, 70, 11, 529, 1203, 1321, 627, 121, 76, 907, 3480, 8, 338, 3169, 136, 17, 110, 431, 248, 54, 57, 20, 369, 719, 12, 52, 110, 774, 331, 10, 131, 1, 551, 41, 127, 472, 262, 1, 121, 118, 42, 70, 1888]"

Lets start with the fact that frozen is like a copy of tangled, Rapunzel and Anna have a lot in common for example they both are locked inside for their own good, they want freedom, and they both look alike.i have a feeling that the creators of tangled ran out of ideas so they had to make up a character who can't control her power and have her own parents lock her up instead of teaching her how to properly control it. they shouldn't lock her away and make her afraid of herself.i also feel like the characters would've been better off in 2D instead of 3D, in 3D their eyes are enormously huge, their noses are like buttons,their lips so thin,and it looks like their wearing lipstick or eyeliner. I'm not saying i don't like the movie i actually really like it, maybe because of the song frozen that was amazingly done by Indina Menzel.

671,7,"1st watched 2/28/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Jennifer Lee & Chris Buck): Fun, thought-provoking Disney winner as they continue the tradition of entertaining animated family-oriented feature films. This is a story about two sisters who are separated from one another at an early age due to the older one's special powers accidentally harming the other. The parents are told to do this to protect the younger one, Anna, by an elder rock-troll after healing her. The parents(who are King&Queen of a town called Arondale) then die in an accident, but the separation is kept in place until the elder of the two sisters is coronated as Queen of the city. During the celebration, the elders ice-creating powers is revealed and she banishes herself up a mountain and unknowingly brings upon a frozen winter-like condition to the area. The movie is based on the Hans Christian Anderson story ""The Snow Queen"", which is what she now makes herself isolated from other people. Anna, then decides to seek her out in a quest up the mountain to hopefully reverse the process.(By the waya perfect movie for the horrible 2013-2014 winter season that doesn't want to go awayalthough I don't think Disney knew this was going to happen while making it) This is a song-filled(almost too much so at times) new classic that, in my opinion, doesn't deserve it's PG-rating. The movie even has a meaningful theme by the time it ends, with some added laughs primarily from a re-animated snowman named Olaf, romance, action and some mystery as we try to figure out how the happy ending is going to happen. Some of the plot twists don't make a lot of sense, but this is only a minor flaw to an otherwise well done new Disney film that I'm sure will be enjoyed by families for awhile as it's promoted to home video offerings.","['st', 'watch', 'dir', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'chris', 'buck', 'fun', 'thought', 'provoke', 'disney', 'winner', 'continue', 'tradition', 'entertain', 'animate', 'family', 'orient', 'feature', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'separate', 'one', 'another', 'early', 'age', 'due', 'old', 'one', 'special', 'power', 'accidentally', 'harm', 'parent', 'told', 'protect', 'young', 'one', 'anna', 'elder', 'rock', 'troll', 'heal', 'parent', 'king', 'queen', 'town', 'call', 'arondale', 'die', 'accident', 'separation', 'kept', 'place', 'elder', 'two', 'sister', 'coronate', 'queen', 'city', 'celebration', 'elder', 'ice', 'create', 'power', 'reveal', 'banishes', 'mountain', 'unknowingly', 'brings', 'upon', 'frozen', 'winter', 'like', 'condition', 'area', 'movie', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'make', 'isolated', 'people', 'anna', 'decides', 'seek', 'quest', 'mountain', 'hopefully', 'reverse', 'process', 'way', 'perfect', 'movie', 'horrible', 'winter', 'season', 'want', 'go', 'away', 'although', 'think', 'disney', 'knew', 'go', 'happen', 'make', 'song', 'fill', 'almost', 'much', 'time', 'new', 'classic', 'opinion', 'deserve', 'pg', 'rating', 'movie', 'even', 'meaningful', 'theme', 'time', 'end', 'add', 'laugh', 'primarily', 'animate', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'romance', 'action', 'mystery', 'try', 'figure', 'happy', 'end', 'go', 'happen', 'plot', 'twist', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'minor', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'well', 'new', 'disney', 'film', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'family', 'awhile', 'promote', 'home', 'video', 'offering']","[1405, 23, 4842, 464, 416, 526, 490, 125, 92, 1607, 2, 1419, 647, 1071, 243, 38, 72, 2502, 229, 3, 12, 42, 15, 786, 10, 102, 594, 139, 404, 64, 10, 316, 24, 300, 709, 118, 511, 513, 73, 10, 7, 1139, 834, 123, 1234, 118, 97, 49, 602, 308, 368, 480, 2196, 498, 188, 1139, 42, 15, 3871, 49, 1389, 3269, 1139, 33, 134, 24, 528, 2845, 214, 2439, 509, 554, 5, 105, 9, 1100, 1266, 1, 256, 44, 245, 467, 12, 39, 49, 14, 782, 46, 7, 996, 997, 1527, 214, 1309, 1700, 1097, 50, 175, 1, 896, 105, 1040, 59, 13, 101, 255, 37, 2, 488, 13, 290, 14, 11, 481, 173, 31, 20, 108, 69, 258, 483, 2205, 437, 1, 28, 1514, 226, 20, 41, 269, 190, 2013, 38, 45, 183, 32, 363, 345, 2203, 87, 630, 301, 41, 13, 290, 52, 129, 14, 84, 217, 670, 386, 827, 18, 108, 2, 3, 207, 91, 72, 3170, 1829, 533, 970, 1611]"

676,8,"Disney's newest adventure, Frozen, is a spectacle unlike any we've seen in a long time. The animation studio's venture into the cold is pure magic, twisting on the theme of true love that the Disney princesses are known for.Frozen is loosely, and I mean LOOSELY based on Hans Christian Anderson's classic story of The Snow Queen. But this version doesn't pit the two girls as rivals for a male's affection. They are sisters. Within the first few minutes, thanks to a lot of quick yet touching storytelling akin to the opening of Up, you understand their complicated relationship completely. These characters have so much depth, in fact, that they, arguably, give some of the best and most believable performances in Disney's long history of animation.The combination of design, animation and voice acting for both Elsa and Anna create two very strong and well rounded characters that both complement and contrast each other. Elsa, the older sister, goes from being a kid princess to a young queen with much more responsibility than her younger sister Anna can understand. But the two have very similar story arcs through- out the film as they both grow into their confidence.The movie almost has feminist qualities with how strong the sisters are presented. Anna and Elsa, after all, are the only two main female characters with silly, bumbling, lovelorn and/or conniving men all around them. On top of that you have the juxtaposition of the freedom of woman in nature versus the stigma of witchcraft. It's about what helps you to find what's important and who you really are as opposed to who others want you to be.Anna and Rapunzel, from Disney's earlier film Tangled, are somewhat different versions of the same character. They have the same personality and plight, but Anna's method of achieving an outcome is far more in charge. Elsa, on the other hand, stands on her own as a scene stealer. I don't think we've ever seen a Disney character quite like this before. She is a powerhouse.All this before even getting to the visual artistry of the film. Stark snow reflecting vibrantly colored skies and glossy ice creating mirrored patterns are showcased beautifully here, to realistic effect. You feel a chill in the air with every gust of wind and every falling snowflake. Even Elsa's Bob Mackie-esque gown coldly glitters around her.Frozen is soft and dramatic at the same time, giving it the styling of a music video. In fact, the movie is tailor made to be Disney's most spectacular stage musical to date, if they were to follow through on such an idea. The songs flow in and out of the story in a way that if most of them were taken out, the audience would have a lot of questions. At the same time, they are catchy enough for you to be humming one or two on the way out of the theater.Overall, Hans Kristoff Annaderson's.er, that should be Hans Christian Anderson's The Snow Queen has been adapted and transformed into something of an instant classic for Disney, with playful music, lush visuals and a strong story and characters that should inspire confidence in being one's self. Else has quickly leaped into my handful of favorite Disney characters. Now excuse me while I go watch her againin 3D.","['disney', 'new', 'adventure', 'frozen', 'spectacle', 'unlike', 'see', 'long', 'time', 'animation', 'studio', 'venture', 'cold', 'pure', 'magic', 'twist', 'theme', 'true', 'love', 'disney', 'princess', 'know', 'frozen', 'loosely', 'mean', 'loosely', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'classic', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'version', 'pit', 'two', 'girl', 'rival', 'male', 'affection', 'sister', 'within', 'first', 'minute', 'thanks', 'lot', 'quick', 'yet', 'touch', 'storytelling', 'akin', 'opening', 'understand', 'complicate', 'relationship', 'completely', 'character', 'much', 'depth', 'fact', 'arguably', 'give', 'best', 'believable', 'performance', 'disney', 'long', 'history', 'animation', 'combination', 'design', 'animation', 'voice', 'act', 'elsa', 'anna', 'create', 'two', 'strong', 'well', 'round', 'character', 'complement', 'contrast', 'elsa', 'old', 'sister', 'go', 'kid', 'princess', 'young', 'queen', 'much', 'responsibility', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'understand', 'two', 'similar', 'story', 'arc', 'film', 'grow', 'confidence', 'movie', 'almost', 'feminist', 'quality', 'strong', 'sister', 'present', 'anna', 'elsa', 'two', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'silly', 'bumbling', 'lovelorn', 'connive', 'men', 'around', 'top', 'juxtaposition', 'freedom', 'woman', 'nature', 'versus', 'stigma', 'witchcraft', 'help', 'find', 'important', 'really', 'oppose', 'others', 'want', 'anna', 'rapunzel', 'disney', 'earlier', 'film', 'tangle', 'somewhat', 'different', 'version', 'character', 'personality', 'plight', 'anna', 'method', 'achieve', 'outcome', 'far', 'charge', 'elsa', 'hand', 'stand', 'scene', 'stealer', 'think', 'ever', 'see', 'disney', 'character', 'quite', 'like', 'powerhouse', 'even', 'get', 'visual', 'artistry', 'film', 'stark', 'snow', 'reflect', 'vibrantly', 'color', 'sky', 'glossy', 'ice', 'create', 'mirror', 'pattern', 'showcased', 'beautifully', 'realistic', 'effect', 'feel', 'chill', 'air', 'every', 'gust', 'wind', 'every', 'fall', 'snowflake', 'even', 'elsa', 'bob', 'mackie', 'esque', 'gown', 'coldly', 'glitter', 'around', 'frozen', 'soft', 'dramatic', 'time', 'give', 'style', 'music', 'video', 'fact', 'movie', 'tailor', 'make', 'disney', 'spectacular', 'stage', 'musical', 'date', 'follow', 'idea', 'song', 'flow', 'story', 'way', 'take', 'audience', 'would', 'lot', 'question', 'time', 'catchy', 'enough', 'hum', 'one', 'two', 'way', 'theater', 'overall', 'han', 'kristoff', 'annaderson', 'er', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'adapt', 'transform', 'something', 'instant', 'classic', 'disney', 'playful', 'music', 'lush', 'visuals', 'strong', 'story', 'character', 'inspire', 'confidence', 'one', 'self', 'else', 'quickly', 'leap', 'handful', 'favorite', 'disney', 'character', 'excuse', 'go', 'watch']","[2, 108, 326, 5, 1506, 766, 16, 169, 20, 21, 311, 1991, 366, 724, 150, 129, 226, 62, 6, 2, 29, 56, 5, 696, 218, 696, 256, 44, 245, 467, 69, 12, 39, 49, 435, 3873, 42, 76, 1487, 431, 1333, 15, 654, 36, 211, 1182, 84, 1191, 182, 260, 689, 3096, 631, 216, 979, 153, 291, 8, 31, 609, 201, 1390, 57, 34, 1374, 493, 2, 169, 636, 21, 1414, 424, 21, 86, 112, 4, 7, 134, 42, 167, 18, 911, 8, 2715, 956, 4, 64, 15, 13, 60, 29, 73, 49, 31, 1175, 73, 15, 7, 216, 42, 446, 12, 1529, 3, 285, 2077, 1, 173, 720, 283, 167, 15, 663, 7, 4, 42, 119, 237, 8, 847, 2925, 4846, 459, 200, 239, 1701, 251, 1094, 1985, 4847, 4494, 135, 71, 289, 22, 2508, 247, 59, 7, 527, 2, 846, 3, 83, 572, 140, 435, 8, 407, 1890, 7, 3340, 1531, 1682, 142, 807, 4, 323, 361, 90, 2409, 37, 81, 16, 2, 8, 124, 9, 28, 19, 450, 2630, 3, 39, 1384, 651, 1395, 33, 134, 1944, 2062, 3168, 529, 640, 278, 53, 1117, 1323, 115, 848, 115, 186, 1112, 28, 4, 3531, 1906, 3290, 3855, 200, 5, 1680, 1213, 20, 57, 355, 58, 970, 201, 1, 2620, 14, 2, 671, 1115, 51, 927, 378, 281, 11, 1183, 12, 50, 55, 159, 26, 84, 824, 20, 266, 164, 1048, 10, 42, 50, 312, 166, 44, 67, 3291, 44, 245, 467, 39, 49, 912, 2004, 89, 982, 69, 2, 3146, 58, 1834, 267, 167, 12, 8, 500, 2077, 10, 429, 270, 733, 2539, 3406, 189, 2, 8, 1229, 13, 23]"

I don't mind the princess vibes and love for them, but this films feels like Tangled to me. I rarely say a film is over-hyped, but this is an exception. It not that I don't think this is a good movie, it has clever moments. But nothing about this kept me on the edge of my seat like I did with How to Train Your Dragon.

681,10,"I absolutely adore this movie. When I first watched it, I actually thought it was going to be a musical, because there was so much singing in the beginning. However, after I put my laptop away, I put my cell phone down, and I began to actually watch it, I realized it's funny and charming, and I wanted to keep watching it.This film had some awesome characters. I really felt bad for Elsa, because it would be terrible to have a power like that and have to hide it from people. She never got to use the power in a controlled setting, so how can you learn to use a power if you don't practice? The main character, Anna, is cute. She reminds me a lot of Rapunzel from Tangled. She's beautiful and insanely funny, but she's a bit too trusting. Either way, Kristen Bell did a phenomenal job with her voice, including her singing. (I didn't even actually know she could sing.) She's becoming one of my favorite actresses now.There are some interesting ties into other similar movies, including cameos from other favorite characters. The two other favorite characters are Sven, a cute cuddly moose, and Olaf the snowman (he's my personal favorite). Pay close attention to the song he sings about summer, trust me. It's hysterical.The scenery is breath-taking, especially during Elsa's song ""Let It Go."" This is an original story, considering how many times do you ever see anyone having the power to manipulate ice/frost/cold? (Besides Mortal Kombat's Sub Zero.) The point is, it's a great movie, and it's fun from beginning to end. It might be fun to see a short involving the characters from Frozen and Tangled.

684,10,"Plot:When the newly crowned Queen Elsa accidentally uses her power to turn things into ice to curse her home in infinite winter, her sister Anna teams up with a mountain man, his playful reindeer, and a snowman to change the weather condition.Analysis:Frozen is a fun fairytale animated movie that keeps the Disney heartfelt story combined with amazing 3D animation to create an instant modern classic. Despite being a kids' movie, Frozen is equally entertaining and inspirational for older people too, it doesn't treat its content with a childish approach but with a more mature one that everyone can enjoy. Quality and meanigful drama meets nice humor, astonishing visuals and issues of self doubt to create the perfect uplifting yet addictive film.Elsa is the main character, a young girl with a magical power that she can't control, her fear of hurting her loved ones leads her to isolate herself and keep a distance from everyone, even her own sister. Through many unexpected events, Elsa has to overcome her fears and accept who she is. Her sister Anna on the other hand is a typical optimistic girl that just wants to be truly loved, she seeks for adventure, she wants to celebrate, dance and sing, she is humble and she is enthusiastic about life. Her extrovert personality creates a nice contrast with Elsa's one and makes the whole relationship between them way more important and every moment of conflict way sadder. To help her on her journey to restore summer she finds a polite young man named Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. Kristoff is a nice guy that grew up in the mountains and sells ice for living, he seems cold and unapproachable at first but his true self is unraveled pretty quickly, he is a caring friend especially for Sven and he's nice to people, a great role model for every young man out there. The final member of the main cast is Olaf, the cute, funny snowman that wants summer to come so he can enjoy the sunshine with his new friends, he is cool, hillarious and extremely loveable, everything he says is pure gold and makes this movie even better.The best thing about this, is the amazing storyline. It's not just that it tries to examine very important issues of modern society, it's a friendly touch on the shoulder for all those people with anti-social tendencies, social anxiety, low self-esteem, fear of rejection and many other problems that must be included in films to make these people understand that they are actually not alone and the future could be brighter than they could possibly imagine. This movie doesn't only try but also succeds, it's incredibly heartwarming, totally entertaining and does everything right to produce an amazing result. Many people, many kids feel like Elsa every day and Frozen is the proof they need to continue fighting and believing. Even some minor flaws like the predictable villain, seem like nothing compared to how amazing this movie is, it exceeded all the expectation and I could probably say that for me this is the best animated film I have ever witnessed and the most important one.The songs are quite catchy, Let It Go was a major hit after Frozen was released and Idina Menzel's version is satisfying and beautiful. Do You Wanna Built A Snowman, For The First Time In Forever and many more songs will stuck to your brain, they serve the story, they are cute and they create a beautiful atmosphere for younger and older viewers. Disney has created amazing music throughout the years but it seemed that lately they were more and more boring ones, not something interesting, the songs in this film might trigger you by how overplayed they are but they are definetely worthy to listen to.It's easy to take for granted the visuals, or the importance of the story they tried to tell, it's easy to describe the incredibly cute feeling of the movie as cheesy, but if you choose to watch it with an open mind, it will blow you away no matter how old you are, it's an extremely entertaining film and it can take you to a hauntingly beautiful magical world if you want to. After all, a movie that praises love and battles depression and social anxiety will always be very important and will leave something to every viewer that will give it a chance.Conclusion:I could go on and on about Frozen, it's one of my favourite movies ever, it feels like a personal redemption for me through Elsa's story and I tend to believe that it helped many more people from little kids to grown-ups, it is not only beautiful visually, it's an important and amazing idea that deals with everything many people are too affraid to share and helps them see that they are not alone, they are not doomed and love is the answer to everything. Some might call it cheesy I will call it perfect and beautiful.Rating: 10/10","['plot', 'newly', 'crown', 'queen', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'us', 'power', 'turn', 'thing', 'ice', 'curse', 'home',

Most Disney tales involve childhood psychological trauma combined with royal entitlement but yet the characters in this film are relatable and useful for normal people and children to watch. The dialogue is surprisingly lucid and enjoyable to adults and children alike although the trolls can be a bit cringe but that's also part of the charm.Nearly all of the songs are classics and my daughter can belt them all out.Another plus in favor is the charm the film has with Nordic culture.

703,10,"Various other positive qualities aside, I think this movie perfectly embodies the present time and where we want to be going.A story of two individuals, a sort of sense and sensibility set up, where one is taught to resist one she loves and her inner power only to then embrace the chaos.

705,9,"First of all, I strongly disagree with any assertions that Frozen hearkens back to the great Disney films of the late 80s and early 90s. The music is nowhere near that level, and the storytelling is not nearly as sharp. Even suggesting that this is the best *since* The Lion King rings false with me. I have not seen every Disney film of the past twenty years, but offhand I can say that Tangled, Bolt and Meet the Robinsons are all far superior examples well-written stories than Frozen. In my personal opinion, of course.Second of all, Frozen definitely skews towards the younger crowd, with little to none of the sophisticated touches or wittily mature humor that have come to be somewhat more commonplace in recent animated films. This one is aimed at the pre-teen crowd. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it is worth noting.The overall story is an interesting one, but the execution is rather sloppy and the narrative meanders a bit too much. The dialog, in particular, is not a strength. Unlike the best films, in which every line and every scene feels both essential and perfect, Frozen is more of a loose joyride. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with that approach, but in my personal estimation, it earns lower marks as a storytelling method.The songs are for the most part unremarkable, and some of the musical sequences suffer from not fully committing to dialog or singing. They just feel hastily-choreographed and not fully thought out. And do not even get me started on the troll song. Yikes.Two of the songs, ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" and especially ""Let it Go,"" do work very well. The latter ties into what is unquestionably the best scene in the film on every level. It provides the one glimpse of true majesty, the sort of quality that would explain all of the extremely positive ""this is the greatest"" reviews that are being posted by others. Unfortunately, the film descends most of the way back into mediocrity after that scene.On the positive front, however, Frozen offers a fantastic, gorgeous take on the visual elements of winter. Deep blue ice, snowflakes, white mountains contrasting with colored skies. It is an unspeakably lovely display of a subject matter than CGI animation has never (in my experience) turned its energies to before, at least not like this. Of course, it goes without saying that all of the animation in Frozen, characters and landscapes alike, is excellent.For me, Tangled was much more satisfying than Frozen. I applaud Disney for honing their CGI skills, and for finally adapting The Snow Queen to screen. I just wish that they would have spent more time on the script.With films like this one, a distinction needs to be made between loving it for the visceral takeaway (""it was sweet""/""it had a great message""/""it made me feel good"") and looking at it from a critical standpoint. Now, I understand that one needs to just ""forget about being critical"" and enjoy a film - for me, the best films take care of that themselves. It is the ones, like Frozen, that seem like they clearly could have been much better, that get me thinking about just that.This film is a fun one for kids, and great to look at for adults, but it is far short of being great, or a masterpiece. More focus on an truly excellent story, and it might have been.","['first', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'assertion', 'frozen', 'hearkens', 'back', 'great', 'disney', 'film', 'late', 'early', 'music', 'nowhere', 'near', 'level', 'storytelling', 'nearly', 'sharp', 'even', 'suggest', 'best', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'ring', 'false', 'see', 'every', 'disney', 'film', 'past', 'twenty', 'year', 'offhand', 'say', 'tangle', 'bolt', 'meet', 'robinson', 'far', 'superior', 'example', 'well', 'write', 'story', 'frozen', 'personal', 'opinion', 'course', 'second', 'frozen', 'definitely', 'skews', 'towards', 'young', 'crowd', 'little', 'none', 'sophisticated', 'touch', 'wittily', 'mature', 'humor', 'come', 'somewhat', 'commonplace', 'recent', 'animate', 'film', 'one', 'aim', 'pre', 'teen', 'crowd', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'worth', 'note', 'overall', 'story', 'interest', 'one', 'execution', 'rather', 'sloppy', 'narrative', 'meander', 'bit', 'much', 'dialog', 'particular', 'strength', 'unlike', 'best', 'film', 'every', 'line', 'every', 'scene', 'feel', 'essential', 'perfect', 'frozen', 'loose', 'joyride', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'approach', 'personal', 'estimation', 'earns', 'low', 'mark', 'storytelling', 'method', 'song', 'part', 'unremarkable', 'musical', 'sequence', 'suffer', 'fully', 'commit', 'dialog', 'sing', 'feel', 'hastily', 'choreographed', 'fully', 'thought', 'even', 'get', 'start', 'troll', 'song', 'yikes', 'two', 'song', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'especially', 'let', 'go', 'work', 'well', 'latter', 'tie', 'unquestionably', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'every', 'level', 'provide', 'one', 'glimpse', 'true', 'majesty', 'sort', 'quality', 'would', 'explain', 'extremely', 'positive', 'great', 'review', 'post', 'others', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'descends', 'way', 'back', 'mediocrity', 'scene', 'positive', 'front', 'however', 'frozen', 'offer', 'fantastic', 'gorgeous', 'take', 'visual', 'element', 'winter', 'deep', 'blue', 'ice', 'snowflake', 'white', 'mountain', 'contrast', 'color', 'sky', 'unspeakably', 'lovely', 'display', 'subject', 'matter', 'cgi', 'animation', 'never', 'experience', 'turn', 'energy', 'least', 'like', 'course', 'go', 'without', 'say', 'animation', 'frozen', 'character', 'landscape', 'alike', 'excellent', 'tangle', 'much', 'satisfy', 'frozen', 'applaud', 'disney', 'hone', 'cgi', 'skill', 'finally', 'adapt', 'snow', 'queen', 'screen', 'wish', 'would', 'spent', 'time', 'script', 'film', 'like', 'one', 'distinction', 'need', 'make', 'love', 'visceral', 'takeaway', 'sweet', 'great', 'message', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'look', 'critical', 'standpoint', 'understand', 'one', 'need', 'forget', 'critical', 'enjoy', 'film', 'best', 'film', 'take', 'care', 'one', 'like', 'frozen', 'seem', 'like', 'clearly', 'could', 'much', 'well', 'get', 'think', 'film', 'fun', 'one', 'kid', 'great', 'look', 'adult', 'far', 'short', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'focus', 'truly', 'excellent', 'story', 'might']","[36, 1456, 2109, 4003, 5, 4004, 74, 25, 2, 3, 530, 594, 58, 801, 449, 440, 689, 501, 2556, 28, 1049, 34, 98, 152, 97, 2110, 1950, 16, 115, 2, 3, 276, 1393, 47, 4005, 35, 83, 1951, 244, 2301, 142, 1185, 396, 18, 165, 12, 5, 537, 258, 228, 319, 5, 174, 4006, 538, 73, 1150, 48, 679, 2302, 260, 4007, 1022, 222, 40, 572, 3339, 399, 38, 3, 10, 859, 1394, 1457, 1150, 1284, 65, 43, 254, 625, 166, 12, 122, 10, 1534, 191, 2111, 802, 4008, 95, 31, 1187, 650, 887, 766, 34, 3, 115, 213, 115, 90, 53, 1337, 175, 5, 937, 4009, 156, 2557, 280, 1111, 537, 4010, 2911, 1023, 820, 689, 3340, 11, 94, 2303, 51, 502, 888, 822, 2912, 1187, 63, 53, 2304, 4011, 822, 92, 28, 19, 120, 123, 11, 3341, 42, 11, 59, 202, 45, 121, 30, 13, 107, 18, 955, 1609, 3342, 34, 90, 3, 115, 440, 458, 10, 2558, 62, 3343, 539, 283, 26, 400, 423, 503, 25, 161, 1285, 247, 573, 3, 4012, 50, 74, 4013, 90, 503, 938, 110, 5, 705, 253, 444, 55, 450, 401, 105, 574, 991, 33, 1112, 365, 214, 956, 651, 1395, 4014, 765, 1151, 1822, 375, 555, 21, 88, 334, 113, 1338, 250, 9, 228, 13, 137, 35, 21, 5, 8, 889, 725, 298, 83, 31, 1188, 5, 1235, 2, 3344, 555, 1610, 241, 912, 39, 49, 369, 417, 26, 992, 20, 395, 3, 9, 10, 4015, 99, 14, 6, 3345, 4016, 457, 25, 185, 14, 53, 17, 66, 1458, 2112, 216, 10, 99, 746, 1458, 91, 3, 34, 3, 55, 293, 10, 9, 5, 75, 9, 690, 54, 31, 18, 19, 37, 3, 125, 10, 60, 25, 66, 147, 142, 263, 25, 461, 261, 329, 298, 12, 252]"

712,7,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Six years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a memorable film that people not only didn't forget but regularly asked for its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it's safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.With extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That's what Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows Disney's formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before. Characters go through a traumatic event when they're young. They have to grow up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).It's the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise). Nevertheless, don't get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn't bring anything new story-wise, but it's still a great time. Despite some unnecessary and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices), Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative. I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa's magic is seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.Every character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna's complicated but heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven's camaraderie, I care about all of them... especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of a comic-relief character. He doesn't really have a complex arc in need of extreme development. However, it's impossible not to love him. He's such a welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.Counting him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be a tad exaggerated, but it's convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important as it is fantastic. It's an animated musical, let us not forget about that. Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody plus some exquisite character and story development. That's what I love the most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect: the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward. In my opinion, it's the genre's variation of ""show, don't tell.""In the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney's formula and create a worthy variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of the decade's culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition wasn't overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay, but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company's standards.","['enjoy', 'reading', 'spoiler', 'free',

717,7,"Disney have this structure hands down, they've been doing it for decades. Yet, every so often, one of their animations glisten like a snowflake in the cold breeze. Frozen is just that...but not without some frosty flaws. An adaptation of 'The Snow Queen', Anna and Elsa are housebound in their castle as a result of the latter's cursed icy elemental power. Believing she is causing more harm than good, she flees her kingdom in a bid to ""let it go"" by creating a crystal staircase to her ice shard castle adjacent to a snowy mountain peak. Why? Because it makes excellent staging for THE song. Every musical has one number that trounces the rest, the sole melody that will haunt your mind for the next five years. Radio stations played it, children listened, they sung it, you probably sung it and most likely your pet dog too. ""Let It Go"" is what makes Frozen...Frozen! And I'll stand by the fact that I still jumped out of my seat and launched my arms with honour and valour as I belted out the tune with an almighty roar. Oh, and umm...the film is good too. The message of ""be yourself"" is loud and clear, perhaps delivered slightly heavy handedly, but the sense of grandeur that this film withholds is quite extraordinary. It's a big epic tale filled with innocent princesses, an annoying talking snowman (seriously...urgh), handsome men with noble steeds, or reindeers in this case, and plenty of snow for an ever lasting winter. Classic Disney characters bolstered by a lukewarm script that makes you smile and feel emotionally vulnerable. The animation was simply stunning, particularly the finer details like Elsa's costume transition. Much to my surprise, there is actually a twist! And one I didn't see coming!? Props for pulling it off, did the film necessarily require it? No. But it definitely turned up the heat. I do find that Disney force irritating anthropomorphic characters just for the sake of keeping children amused, I welcome Olaf to the arena. Honestly, wasn't amused. However, Frozen may just be Disney's best musical, but not the best film.","['disney', 'structure', 'hand', 'decade', 'yet', 'every', 'often', 'one', 'animation', 'glisten', 'like', 'snowflake', 'cold', 'breeze', 'frozen', 'without', 'frosty', 'flaw', 'adaptation', 'snow', 'queen', 'anna', 'elsa', 'housebound', 'castle', 'result', 'latter', 'curse', 'icy', 'elemental', 'power', 'believe', 'cause', 'harm', 'good', 'flees', 'kingdom', 'bid', 'let', 'go', 'create', 'crystal', 'staircase', 'ice', 'shard', 'castle', 'adjacent', 'snowy', 'mountain', 'peak', 'make', 'excellent', 'stag', 'song', 'every', 'musical', 'one', 'number', 'trounces', 'rest', 'sole', 'melody', 'haunt', 'mind', 'next', 'five', 'year', 'radio', 'station', 'played', 'child', 'listen', 'sung', 'probably', 'sung', 'likely', 'pet', 'dog', 'let', 'go', 'make', 'frozen', 'frozen', 'stand', 'fact', 'still', 'jumped', 'seat', 'launch', 'arm', 'honour', 'valour', 'belt', 'tune', 'almighty', 'roar', 'oh', 'umm', 'film', 'good', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'perhaps', 'deliver', 'slightly', 'heavy', 'handedly', 'sense', 'grandeur', 'film', 'withholds', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'big', 'epic', 'tale', 'fill', 'innocent', 'princess', 'annoy', 'talk', 'snowman', 'seriously', 'urgh', 'handsome', 'men', 'noble', 'steed', 'reindeer', 'case', 'plenty', 'snow', 'ever', 'last', 'winter', 'classic', 'disney', 'character', 'bolster', 'lukewarm', 'script', 'make', 'smile', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'animation', 'simply', 'stun', 'particularly', 'finer', 'detail', 'like', 'elsa', 'costume', 'transition', 'much', 'surprise', 'actually', 'twist', 'one', 'see', 'come', 'prop', 'pull', 'film', 'necessarily', 'require', 'definitely', 'turn', 'heat', 'find', 'disney', 'force', 'irritate', 'anthropomorphic', 'character', 'sake', 'keep', 'child', 'amuse', 'welcome', 'olaf', 'arena', 'honestly', 'amuse', 'however', 'frozen', 'may', 'disney', 'best', 'musical', 'best', 'film']","[2, 1795, 323, 492, 182, 115, 583, 10, 21, 3882, 9, 1112, 366, 5, 137, 1988, 386, 891, 39, 49, 7, 4, 168, 648, 955, 405, 453, 4868, 24, 220, 328, 709, 17, 710, 77, 4081, 30, 13, 134, 1901, 2702, 33, 3516, 168, 4614, 1218, 214, 2375, 14, 298, 4122, 11, 115, 51, 10, 184, 303, 3006, 1186, 2665, 320, 418, 731, 47, 2421, 2689, 507, 70, 531, 684, 210, 684, 1016, 983, 1095, 30, 13, 14, 5, 5, 361, 201, 68, 4869, 966, 3639, 1933, 3129, 4870, 1276, 804, 4871, 425, 3, 17, 185, 798, 871, 578, 1050, 774, 1376, 217, 4186, 3, 124, 1582, 106, 566, 114, 481, 1315, 29, 238, 178, 45, 667, 739, 459, 2541, 4820, 151, 514, 727, 39, 81, 197, 105, 69, 2, 8, 395, 14, 914, 53, 910, 2491, 21, 341, 315, 536, 3485, 468, 9, 4, 1336, 1740, 31, 445, 103, 129, 10, 16, 40, 3592, 695, 3, 1284, 1364, 174, 113, 1601, 71, 2, 272, 1352, 3616, 8, 1105, 154, 70, 828, 1108, 32, 542, 828, 110, 5, 171, 2, 34, 51, 34, 3]"

721,7,"This film was slightly inspired in the children's tale ""The Snow Queen"" by Han Christian Andersen. Obviously, anyone who knows the original story quickly realizes that there is a totally new story, set in a fictional realm, geographically located in Scandinavia. The kingdom is ruled by a king who dies and leaves the throne for a daughter, Elsa. But she lives isolated by the fact that she was born with a gift that she is not able to control: she freezes everything in which she touches, including people. The one who suffers most is her sister, Anna, unable to understand her isolation because she is unaware of that power. The film revolves around these facts, and the relationship between the two sisters.The story is beautiful and really able to move the audience and make him identify with the princesses. Elsa is a strong woman, able to make decisions alone, in the style of the modern Disney princesses, whereas Anna is more affectionate, dependent and romantic, mainly thinking in her need to marry a prince. So we can see here the meeting between a modern Disney princess and an old-fashioned Disney princess. It's very interesting to look at these differences and see how the two sisters relate, as well as how they change and transform one another. And while there is an obvious male hero (Kristoff, a merchant), the film shows that he is the antithesis of a prince and princes may be the worst option.There are some script options that don't make sense and some of the characters' actions have no logic. Despite that, the movie works. One of the nicer characters is a talking snowman, magically created. This movie is full of magic, especially that which is provided by a good, dedicated and professional CGI team. The film has good visual and special effects, excellent animations and magnificent colors. The snow is bright, it looks fluffy and the ice is more elegant than a lot of expensive crystal I see around. Finally, we must talk about the awesome song ""Let It Go"", carried out by Elsa. Its very easily in the ear, joining to the extensive roll of iconic songs that Disney immortalized.In short, its an excellent animated film, designed for the whole family and not just for children. Carefully well done, especially in the more technical aspects, it has a rather functional history, despite some glaring flaws and illogical situations.","['film', 'slightly', 'inspire', 'child', 'tale', 'snow', 'queen', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'obviously', 'anyone', 'know', 'original', 'story', 'quickly', 'realizes', 'totally', 'new', 'story', 'set', 'fictional', 'realm', 'geographically', 'locate', 'scandinavia', 'kingdom', 'rule', 'king', 'dy', 'leaf', 'throne', 'daughter', 'elsa', 'life', 'isolated', 'fact', 'born', 'gift', 'able', 'control', 'freeze', 'everything', 'touch', 'include', 'people', 'one', 'suffers', 'sister', 'anna', 'unable', 'understand', 'isolation', 'unaware', 'power', 'film', 'revolves', 'around', 'fact', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'story', 'beautiful', 'really', 'able', 'move', 'audience', 'make', 'identify', 'princess', 'elsa', 'strong', 'woman', 'able', 'make', 'decision', 'alone', 'style', 'modern', 'disney', 'princess', 'whereas', 'anna', 'affectionate', 'dependent', 'romantic', 'mainly', 'think', 'need', 'marry', 'prince', 'see', 'meeting', 'modern', 'disney', 'princess', 'old', 'fashion', 'disney', 'princess', 'interest', 'look', 'difference', 'see', 'two', 'sister', 'relate', 'well', 'change', 'transform', 'one', 'another', 'obvious', 'male', 'hero', 'kristoff', 'merchant', 'film', 'show', 'antithesis', 'prince', 'prince', 'may', 'bad', 'option', 'script', 'option', 'make', 'sense', 'character', 'action', 'logic', 'despite', 'movie', 'work', 'one', 'nicer', 'character', 'talk', 'snowman', 'magically', 'create', 'movie', 'full', 'magic', 'especially', 'provide', 'good', 'dedicate', 'professional', 'cgi', 'team', 'film', 'good', 'visual', 'special', 'effect', 'excellent', 'animation', 'magnificent', 'color', 'snow', 'bright', 'look', 'fluffy', 'ice', 'elegant', 'lot', 'expensive', 'crystal', 'see', 'around', 'finally', 'must', 'talk', 'awesome', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'carry', 'elsa', 'easily', 'ear', 'join', 'extensive', 'roll', 'iconic', 'song', 'disney', 'immortalize', 'short', 'excellent', 'animate', 'film', 'design', 'whole', 'family', 'child', 'carefully', 'well', 'especially', 'technical', 'aspect', 'rather', 'functional', 'history', 'despite', 'glare', 'flaw', 'illogical', 'situation']","[3, 774, 500, 70, 114, 39, 49, 44, 245, 339, 613, 299, 56, 230, 12, 733, 1571, 557, 108, 12, 144, 1588, 3214, 3296, 2071, 77, 788, 97, 3589, 586, 952, 389, 4, 79, 782, 201, 589, 832, 294, 128, 282, 132, 260, 349, 46, 10, 2369, 15, 7, 1178, 216, 600, 2290, 24, 3, 2261, 200, 201, 153, 42, 15, 12, 93, 22, 294, 242, 159, 14, 2641, 29, 4, 167, 251, 294, 14, 758, 344, 355, 324, 2, 29, 1565, 7, 3610, 2776, 393, 934, 37, 99, 390, 82, 16, 1574, 324, 2, 29, 64, 974, 2, 29, 122, 66, 1164, 16, 42, 15, 785, 18, 209, 2004, 10, 102, 595, 431, 544, 67, 2220, 3, 78, 82, 82, 171, 65, 1974, 395, 1974, 14, 217, 8, 345, 1464, 313, 1, 107, 10, 3854, 8, 178, 45, 1663, 134, 1, 246, 150, 121, 458, 17, 4872, 3683, 555, 486, 3, 17, 450, 316, 278, 298, 21, 935, 651, 39, 1425, 66, 3407, 33, 2471, 84, 2965, 1901, 16, 200, 241, 236, 178, 338, 11, 30, 13, 853, 4, 403, 939, 813, 4873, 985, 1807, 11, 2, 263, 298, 38, 3, 424, 127, 72, 70, 2454, 18, 121, 1891, 443, 191, 636, 313, 2970, 386, 2586, 867]"

723,7,"A nice, prototypical Disney mix of morals and fables, updated to better resonate with modern audiences. That last bit is far easier said than done, and has spelled doom for many a well-intentioned film in the past, but Frozen does a fine job of accomplishing it without much strain. I'm not a fan of musicals in general, though - it takes something especially inventive, spirited or catchy to overcome that bias - and to my ears this had none of the above. In fact, the jingles stand in contrast to the advances enjoyed by the storytelling; in an effort to feel more fresh, timely and dazzling, the music strains too hard and winds up overly American Idol-tainted and homogenized. Definitely not my taste. The story's got some emotional punch, though, smearing the black-and-white virtues that typify films of this genre, and the voice acting is upper-tier. Exceptional visuals, too, even if those stylings fall into a weird sort of Pixar / Dreamworks hybrid. Bonus points for poking and prodding a largely-overlooked Norse society, though like Brave a few years prior, I felt like it left a lot of that potential on the table.","['nice', 'prototypical', 'disney', 'mix', 'moral', 'fable', 'update', 'well', 'resonate', 'modern', 'audience', 'last', 'bit', 'far', 'easy', 'say', 'spell', 'doom', 'many', 'well', 'intentioned', 'film', 'past', 'frozen', 'fine', 'job', 'accomplish', 'without', 'much', 'strain', 'fan', 'musical', 'general', 'though', 'take', 'something', 'especially', 'inventive', 'spirit', 'catchy', 'overcome', 'bias', 'ear', 'none', 'fact', 'jingle', 'stand', 'contrast', 'advance', 'enjoy', 'storytelling', 'effort', 'feel', 'fresh', 'timely', 'dazzle', 'music', 'strain', 'hard', 'wind', 'overly', 'american', 'idol', 'taint', 'homogenize', 'definitely', 'taste', 'story', 'get', 'emotional', 'punch', 'though', 'smear', 'black', 'white', 'virtue', 'typify', 'film', 'genre', 'voice', 'act', 'upper', 'tier', 'exceptional', 'visuals', 'even', 'stylings', 'fall', 'weird', 'sort', 'pixar', 'dreamworks', 'hybrid', 'bonus', 'point', 'poke', 'prod', 'largely', 'overlook', 'norse', 'society', 'though', 'like', 'brave', 'year', 'prior', 'felt', 'like', 'left', 'lot', 'potential', 'table']","[192, 4751, 2, 1119, 551, 2802, 2482, 18, 3180, 324, 159, 197, 95, 142, 454, 35, 858, 2728, 61, 18, 3, 276, 5, 470, 373, 2883, 137, 31, 2033, 176, 51, 623, 100, 55, 89, 121, 1819, 767, 266, 1009, 1715, 939, 679, 201, 361, 956, 3297, 91, 689, 575, 53, 819, 4811, 1786, 58, 2033, 307, 848, 1200, 1413, 4043, 174, 1120, 12, 19, 342, 1359, 100, 1172, 365, 3883, 3, 768, 86, 112, 737, 3230, 1846, 267, 28, 4874, 186, 1063, 539, 194, 1035, 2055, 117, 1794, 4317, 2884, 2247, 943, 100, 9, 335, 47, 1883, 155, 9, 330, 84, 685, 1461]"

728,-,"""Hi, everyone. I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!"" (voice of Josh Gad)That self-introduction by a cute snowman will give you an idea of how contemporary and friendly the newest Disney animation is. When my granddaughter declared Frozen was the best movie she ever saw, I determined to see it because any recommendation from a 12-year old must be heeded. Although Frozen turned out to be not a tear-jerking Casablanca, it is one of Disney's best musical animations and high-grade nectar for pre- teens. Smartly pushing the theme of love, it covers all the fairy-tale bases from challenged princesses, multiple suitors, lovable animals, and enough magic to make a kingdom.Elsa (Idina Menzel voice) is the heir apparent to the kingdom but has a wicked curse that freezes things and isolates her because of it. Determined to get her sister back and break the curse, Anna (Kristen Bell), along with working-class hunk Kristoff (Jonatham Groff), seeks out her sister in her remote ice palace. Although you pretty much know what will happen, directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee with Lee's screenplay never descend to the maudlin or cheap romance. Love is the object to melt the world, and it doesn't come easily.Making the old Hans Christian Anderson story contemporary is as easy as having Kristoff exclaim when his sled burns, ""Ahh, and I just got it paid off!"" The preparation for teenage and adult responsibilities is laced with comments like Kristoff's to Anna: ""Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?"" The combination of romance and reality is effective, no more so than with the big, Broadway-like songs perfectly matched to the theme.The challenges are many, not quite as physical as often happens, to make the defeat of evil, not quite as evil as usual either, rightly earned. Despite the possible interpretations such as a need for inclusion and the solitude of being different (gay?), Frozen should warm the whole family with its humor and adventure. But be careful with your pre-teen girls: This movie empowers young women to make their own life and fight their own battles. I hope that translates to your house peacefully.","['hi', 'everyone', 'olaf', 'like', 'warm', 'hug', 'voice', 'josh', 'gad', 'self', 'introduction', 'cute', 'snowman', 'give', 'idea', 'contemporary', 'friendly', 'new', 'disney', 'animation', 'granddaughter', 'declare', 'frozen', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'determine', 'see', 'recommendation', 'year', 'old', 'must', 'heed', 'although', 'frozen', 'turn', 'tear', 'jerking', 'casablanca', 'one', 'disney', 'best', 'musical', 'animation', 'high', 'grade', 'nectar', 'pre', 'teen', 'smartly', 'push', 'theme', 'love', 'cover', 'fairy', 'tale', 'base', 'challenged', 'princess', 'multiple', 'suitor', 'lovable', 'animal', 'enough', 'magic', 'make', 'kingdom', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'voice', 'heir', 'apparent', 'kingdom', 'wicked', 'curse', 'freeze', 'thing', 'isolates', 'determine', 'get', 'sister', 'back', 'break', 'curse', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'along', 'work', 'class', 'hunk', 'kristoff', 'jonatham', 'groff', 'seek', 'sister', 'remote', 'ice', 'palace', 'although', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'happen', 'director', 'chris', 'buck', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'lee', 'screenplay', 'never', 'descend', 'maudlin', 'cheap', 'romance', 'love', 'object', 'melt', 'world', 'come', 'easily', 'make', 'old', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'story', 'contemporary', 'easy', 'kristoff', 'exclaim', 'sled', 'burn', 'ahh', 'get', 'paid', 'preparation', 'teenage', 'adult', 'responsibility', 'lace', 'comment', 'like', 'kristoff', 'anna', 'parent', 'ever', 'warn', 'stranger', 'combination', 'romance', 'reality', 'effective', 'big', 'broadway', 'like', 'song', 'perfectly', 'match', 'theme', 'challenge', 'many', 'quite', 'physical', 'often', 'happens', 'make', 'defeat', 'evil', 'quite', 'evil', 'usual', 'either', 'rightly', 'earn', 'despite', 'possible', 'interpretation', 'need', 'inclusion', 'solitude', 'different', 'gay', 'frozen', 'warm', 'whole', 'family', 'humor', 'adventure', 'careful', 'pre', 'teen', 'girl', 'movie', 'empowers', 'young', 'woman', 'make', 'life', 'fight', 'battle', 'hope', 'translates', 'house', 'peacefully']","[2885, 109, 32, 9, 362, 1236, 86, 275, 257, 429, 1304, 265, 45, 57, 281, 1685, 837, 108, 2, 21, 3286, 2741, 5, 34, 1, 81, 157, 993, 16, 3203, 47, 64, 236, 255, 5, 113, 748, 4303, 10, 2, 34, 51, 21, 206, 1552, 1394, 1457, 2627, 809, 226, 6, 712, 219, 114, 256, 29, 1418, 3248, 726, 876, 164, 150, 14, 77, 4, 141, 116, 86, 1647, 1817, 77, 678, 405, 282, 43, 2293, 993, 19, 15, 74, 340, 405, 7, 162, 146, 172, 107, 1283, 4879, 67, 377, 997, 15, 2983, 33, 383, 255, 136, 31, 56, 290, 770, 526, 490, 464, 416, 416, 1027, 88, 4880, 2886, 363, 6, 1491, 359, 126, 40, 403, 14, 64, 44, 245, 467, 12, 1685, 454, 67, 2705, 2398, 2700, 4588, 19, 1843, 3879, 2690, 147, 1175, 3858, 916, 9, 67, 7, 118, 81, 1228, 1249, 1414, 363, 940, 1363, 106, 411, 9, 11, 456, 553, 226, 1589, 61, 124, 1873, 583, 591, 14, 2294, 277, 124, 277, 562, 353, 2718, 1655, 313, 673, 2244, 99, 3551, 1440, 140, 2047, 5, 362, 127, 72, 222, 326, 2275, 1394, 1457, 76, 1, 73, 251, 14, 79, 816, 1435, 384, 899]"

You need to be proud of yourself, love will find a way and make people accept you"". Yes, someone saw a LGBT message, but it's just one of the interpretations you could use... it's a universal message, good for everybody.I enjoyed the movie, even if I'm a 30 years old guy, and also children enjoyed the movie a lot.

731,7,"FROZENAnother Disney film that did not disappoint.The movie is about 2 princesses. One princess has powers where she can freeze anything at all. Everything is fine until one day she accidentally hurts her little sister whilst playing with her in the snow. Since then she is being forced to hide her power from everyone, so she locks herself in her room and hardly every comes out. One day when she becomes queen she accidentally freezes the entire town and runs away. Her little sister takes a trip to find her big sister so she can help her and get her to defrost the town.The film is a great little adventure. It is a lot of fun to watch and full of excitement. The new characters she encounters along the way were brilliant. I thought they were funny, especially the little snowman and the deer.Halfway through this film I was thinking that it is a typical Disney film with a very predictable ending, but the truth is it wasn't. The ending was not expected. It is a nice surprise not to guess the ending of a princess story.The other thing I liked about this is it didn't have a typical villain. The bad guy through most of the movie was the queen, but she was not bad she was just scared and wanted to be alone. It made a change to the typical story and I really liked that twist.The only thing I was disappointed with was the trailer. I loved the trailer so much. The snowman was trying to catch his carrot nose on the ice as the deer tried to catch the carrot too... both of which were slipping and sliding all over the place. I thought this was so funny and even though I have seen it a lot, I was looking forward to seeing it in the final movie, but it is not there at all. It was made as a trailer only which is a shame. But i still love it.If you are a fan of Disney and you love animation movies, then this is not to be missed.I will give this film 7 out of 10, but only because it is very good, but not as good as some of the older classics that I lover so much.""It's not nice to throw people""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl","['frozenanother', 'disney', 'film', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'princess', 'one', 'princess', 'power', 'freeze', 'anything', 'everything', 'fine', 'one', 'day', 'accidentally', 'hurt', 'little', 'sister', 'whilst', 'play', 'snow', 'since', 'force', 'hide', 'power', 'everyone', 'lock', 'room', 'hardly', 'every', 'come', 'one', 'day', 'becomes', 'queen', 'accidentally', 'freeze', 'entire', 'town', 'run', 'away', 'little', 'sister', 'take', 'trip', 'find', 'big', 'sister', 'help', 'get', 'defrost', 'town', 'film', 'great', 'little', 'adventure', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'full', 'excitement', 'new', 'character', 'encounter', 'along', 'way', 'brilliant', 'thought', 'funny', 'especially', 'little', 'snowman', 'deer', 'halfway', 'film', 'think', 'typical', 'disney', 'film', 'predictable', 'end', 'truth', 'end', 'expect', 'nice', 'surprise', 'guess', 'end', 'princess', 'story', 'thing', 'like', 'typical', 'villain', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'queen', 'bad', 'scar', 'want', 'alone', 'make', 'change', 'typical', 'story', 'really', 'like', 'twist', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'trailer', 'love', 'trailer', 'much', 'snowman', 'try', 'catch', 'carrot', 'nose', 'ice', 'deer', 'try', 'catch', 'carrot', 'slip', 'slide', 'place', 'thought', 'funny', 'even', 'though', 'see', 'lot', 'look', 'forward', 'see', 'final', 'movie', 'make', 'trailer', 'shame', 'still', 'love', 'fan', 'disney', 'love', 'animation', 'movie', 'miss', 'give', 'film', 'good', 'good', 'old', 'classic', 'lover', 'much', 'nice', 'throw', 'people', 'review', 'please', 'like', 'facebook', 'page', 'http', 'www', 'facebook', 'com', 'page', 'ordinary', 'person', 'movie', 'review', 'ref', 'hl']","[2, 3, 808, 1, 29, 10, 29, 24, 282, 212, 132, 470, 10, 138, 300, 305, 48, 15, 1130, 204, 39, 98, 272, 676, 24, 109, 382, 506, 976, 115, 40, 10, 138, 380, 49, 300, 282, 264, 602, 233, 101, 48, 15, 55, 1066, 71, 106, 15, 135, 19, 3887, 602, 3, 25, 48, 326, 84, 125, 23, 246, 1871, 108, 8, 951, 172, 50, 523, 92, 85, 121, 48, 45, 1905, 1612, 3, 37, 376, 2, 3, 331, 41, 1690, 41, 131, 192, 445, 388, 41, 29, 12, 43, 9, 376, 104, 65, 148, 1, 49, 65, 878, 59, 344, 14, 209, 376, 12, 22, 9, 129, 43, 476, 394, 6, 394, 31, 45, 87, 1321, 1146, 971, 33, 1905, 87, 1321, 1146, 1687, 4881, 188, 92, 85, 28, 100, 16, 84, 66, 571, 16, 817, 1, 14, 394, 1403, 68, 6, 176, 2, 6, 21, 1, 271, 57, 3, 17, 17, 64, 69, 1350, 31, 192, 744, 46, 161, 576, 9, 2080, 2800, 1666, 1489, 2080, 968, 2800, 1420, 441, 1, 161, 3799]"

733,8,"Very loosely adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, the latest family flick from the Mouse House is an absolute treat for young and old. The effective prologue - that effortlessly goes from heart warming to heart breaking - will have grown men ""getting the dust"" out of their eyes, before the movie leaps forward to present day with a couple of belting tunes from Kristen Bell's Anna and her sister, Idina Menzel's Elsa. After it all goes wrong for Elsa we spend the next hour on an icy trek with Anna and her ragtag pals: the rough-around-the-edges Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), his loyal and amusing reindeer Sven, and the hilarious, adorable and show-stealing snowman Olaf (Josh Gad). It's all very predictable and rarely veers away from the traditional folk tale mould, but it moves along at such a fast pace and features so many funny and/or touching moments that the cliché-laden narrative beats are hardly a problem. The songs are catchy and the animation is crisp and beautiful, which, after the unremarkable and rather indifferent Tangled, assists Disney in a wonderful comeback in the fairytale genre.","['loosely', 'adapt', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'late', 'family', 'flick', 'mouse', 'house', 'absolute', 'treat', 'young', 'old', 'effective', 'prologue', 'effortlessly', 'go', 'heart', 'warm', 'heart', 'break', 'grown', 'men', 'get', 'dust', 'eye', 'movie', 'leap', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'couple', 'belting', 'tune', 'kristen', 'bell', 'anna', 'sister', 'idina', 'menzel', 'elsa', 'go', 'wrong', 'elsa', 'spend', 'next', 'hour', 'icy', 'trek', 'anna', 'ragtag', 'pal', 'rough', 'around', 'edge', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'loyal', 'amuse', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'hilarious', 'adorable', 'show', 'steal', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'josh', 'gad', 'predictable', 'rarely', 'veers', 'away', 'traditional', 'folk', 'tale', 'mould', 'move', 'along', 'fast', 'pace', 'feature', 'many', 'funny', 'touch', 'moment', 'clich', 'laden', 'narrative', 'beat', 'hardly', 'problem', 'song', 'catchy', 'animation', 'crisp', 'beautiful', 'unremarkable', 'rather', 'indifferent', 'tangle', 'assist', 'disney', 'wonderful', 'comeback', 'fairytale', 'genre']","[696, 912, 44, 245, 339, 39, 49, 530, 72, 805, 707, 899, 1798, 682, 73, 64, 1363, 4885, 2488, 13, 80, 362, 80, 340, 1107, 459, 19, 3662, 336, 1, 2539, 571, 663, 138, 398, 1949, 804, 162, 146, 7, 15, 141, 116, 4, 13, 280, 4, 1031, 418, 487, 453, 2009, 7, 4324, 2057, 200, 1068, 67, 455, 377, 1502, 828, 151, 181, 364, 687, 78, 906, 45, 32, 275, 257, 331, 1691, 101, 462, 1417, 114, 4886, 242, 172, 780, 564, 229, 61, 85, 260, 133, 274, 4828, 802, 1167, 976, 198, 11, 266, 21, 3641, 93, 2303, 191, 4690, 83, 2, 215, 2679, 756, 768]"
734,8,"Frozen is a new breed of Disney fairy tale 3D animated films, that tries to bring the old genre into modern day audiences, the first one being the hand drawn Princess and the Frog, followed by Tangled. Both Tangled and Frozen have classic princesses fitted into a modern animated film. However in the latter there are two; Anna is normal but her sister, Elsa, has the dangerous power of freezing whenever she gets emotional, therefore she is kept away purposely from her sister so as not to kill her. By making the antagonist the heroine's sister, it shows very accurately the complicated plot of two sisters struggling for their relationship to go smooth so that Elsa can stop the world from plunging into an eternal winter, created from her powers. The only problem is that Elsa was never loved as child due to her condition, and kept away from everyone for their safety. It would have been so damned easy to make Elsa the villain in this film, but she is not the villain. She's a human being who is cast aside because of her special powers, and she rejoices in using them to fulfil who she really is: an ice queen.The best moment comes near the end and it's an amazing twist that has never happened before in a Disney movie. You'll have to see it to understand it better, but it was definitely the favorite part of the film for me.One thing I didn't like is that there were too many short songs. When the characters are only just introduced, they immediately start singing, which makes it annoying. It would have been better if we got to know the characters a lot more before they began their song, like the big hit ""Let It Go"" sequence with Elsa (Idina Menzel's voice makes it even better).For some reason, if the animated Disney film is not a musical featuring a princess, such as Wreck It Ralph, Treasure Planet or Atlantis, it doesn't fit in with the ""crowd"", yet I loved all three of them. Frozen is definitely a superior film to Tangled and I hope that the studios will make even better films.","['frozen', 'new', 'breed', 'disney', 'fairy', 'tale', 'animate', 'film', 'try', 'bring', 'old', 'genre', 'modern', 'day', 'audience', 'first', 'one', 'hand', 'drawn', 'princess', 'frog', 'follow', 'tangle', 'tangle', 'frozen', 'classic', 'princess', 'fit', 'modern', 'animate', 'film', 'however', 'latter', 'two', 'anna', 'normal', 'sister', 'elsa', 'dangerous', 'power', 'freeze', 'whenever', 'get', 'emotional', 'therefore', 'kept', 'away', 'purposely', 'sister', 'kill', 'make', 'antagonist', 'heroine', 'sister', 'show', 'accurately', 'complicate', 'plot', 'two', 'sister', 'struggle', 'relationship', 'go', 'smooth', 'elsa', 'stop', 'world', 'plunge', 'eternal', 'winter', 'create', 'power', 'problem', 'elsa', 'never', 'love', 'child', 'due', 'condition', 'kept', 'away', 'everyone', 'safety', 'would', 'damn', 'easy', 'make', 'elsa', 'villain', 'film', 'villain', 'human', 'cast', 'aside', 'special', 'power', 'rejoices', 'use', 'fulfil', 'really', 'ice', 'queen', 'best', 'moment', 'come', 'near', 'end', 'amaze', 'twist', 'never', 'happen', 'disney', 'movie', 'see', 'understand', 'well', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'like', 'many', 'short', 'song', 'character', 'introduce', 'immediately', 'start', 'sing', 'make', 'annoy', 'would', 'well', 'get', 'know', 'character', 'lot', 'begin', 'song', 'like', 'big', 'hit', 'let', 'go', 'sequence', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'voice', 'make', 'even', 'well', 'reason', 'animate', 'disney', 'film', 'musical', 'feature', 'princess', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'treasure', 'planet', 'atlantis', 'fit', 'crowd', 'yet', 'love', 'three', 'frozen', 'definitely', 'superior', 'film', 'tangle', 'hope', 'studio', 'make', 'even', 'well', 'film']","[5, 108, 3888, 2, 219, 114, 38, 3, 87, 221, 64, 768, 324, 138, 159, 36, 10, 323, 747, 29, 659, 378, 83, 83, 5, 69, 29, 560, 324, 38, 3, 110, 955, 42, 7, 873, 15, 4, 702, 24, 282, 1267, 19, 342, 1241, 498, 101, 4564, 15, 286, 14, 634, 565, 15, 78, 4887, 979, 52, 42, 15, 639, 153, 13, 1878, 4, 284, 126, 2372, 310, 105, 134, 24, 198, 4, 88, 6, 70, 404, 1100, 498, 101, 109, 2712, 26, 1480, 454, 14, 4, 104, 3, 104, 515, 227, 716, 316, 24, 158, 2116, 22, 33, 49, 34, 133, 40, 449, 41, 96, 129, 88, 290, 2, 1, 16, 216, 18, 174, 189, 94, 3, 10, 43, 9, 61, 263, 11, 8, 736, 597, 120, 63, 14, 238, 26, 18, 19, 56, 8, 84, 160, 11, 9, 106, 234, 30, 13, 502, 4, 141, 116, 86, 14, 28, 18, 180, 38, 2, 3, 51, 229, 29, 352, 379, 3123, 2237, 3548, 560, 1150, 182, 6, 433, 5, 174, 1185, 3, 83, 384, 311, 14, 28, 18, 3]"
735,8,"The latest Disney opus ""Frozen"" is based on the Hans Christian Andersen's complex tale entitled ""The Snow Queen."" In this story, two close friends named Kai and Gerda were separated when splinters of an enchanted mirror enters Kai's eyes and heart and makes him hate everything he loved. The Snow Queen kisses the boy, making him forget Gerda and his family, and takes him to her frozen palace. Gerda risks all odds to locate Kai and when she finds him, her warm tears of love melts the shards of mirror from Kai's heart and eyes, and releases him from the Snow Queen's spell.""Frozen"" is nothing like this story at all. Instead we only get the ice palace, someone's heart getting frozen and needing true love to be saved. The story spun around this basic story was a wholly original tale about two royal sisters. One, Elsa, had a wonderful but dangerous power to create ice and wintry weather. The other one, Anna, being normal, had been kept in the dark about her sister's power following a near-tragic accident, so the two had been estranged since childhood. When Elsa's powers were unceremoniously revealed at her own coronation as Queen, she flees and builds her own icy Winter Palace up a high mountain. Anna goes out to search for her sister, meeting a kind icemaker Kristoff, his hardy reindeer Sven, magical Trolls and a talking snowman named Olaf who join her on her quest. Can Anna mend her relationship with her sister, discover love in time, and save their kingdom from the eternal winter that envelops it?The visuals of the wintry wonderland where this animated film is set were fantastically rendered. That part where Elsa was building her palace of ice was a most wondrous scene that will inspire awe. Cute as his character may have been written, I did not like the way they drew the face of Olaf the snowman. Truth to tell, when I first saw Olaf in the trailer, I almost did not want to watch the whole film. The song that accompanied Elsa's emancipation entitled ""Let It Go"" was breathtaking as sung by the incomparable voice of Idina Menzel. This was easily the best and most memorable song of the film. Many of the songs, especially by Anna, were Broadway-esque, sweeping and melodic. The Trolls and Olaf have featured quirky songs of their own. Though cute, these songs both sounded out of place from the rest of the songs.The story line of sisterly love and devotion is also a novel approach that makes this production stand out. Elsa had a unique and interesting predicament because of the powers she possessed. It would have been better I think if the film centered more on her than on Anna. The fact that this film had two female heroines will make this appeal more to the young female demographic.","['late', 'disney', 'opus', 'frozen', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'complex', 'tale', 'entitle', 'snow', 'queen', 'story', 'two', 'close', 'friend', 'name', 'kai', 'gerda', 'separate', 'splinter', 'enchant', 'mirror', 'enters', 'kai', 'eye', 'heart', 'make', 'hate', 'everything', 'love', 'snow', 'queen', 'kiss', 'boy', 'make', 'forget', 'gerda', 'family', 'take', 'frozen', 'palace', 'gerda', 'risk', 'odds', 'locate', 'kai', 'find', 'warm', 'tear', 'love', 'melt', 'shard', 'mirror', 'kai', 'heart', 'eye', 'release', 'snow', 'queen', 'spell', 'frozen', 'nothing', 'like', 'story', 'instead', 'get', 'ice', 'palace', 'someone', 'heart', 'get', 'frozen', 'need', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'story', 'spun', 'around', 'basic', 'story', 'wholly', 'original', 'tale', 'two', 'royal', 'sister', 'one', 'elsa', 'wonderful', 'dangerous', 'power', 'create', 'ice', 'wintry', 'weather', 'one', 'anna', 'normal', 'kept', 'dark', 'sister', 'power', 'follow', 'near', 'tragic', 'accident', 'two', 'estrange', 'since', 'childhood', 'elsa', 'power', 'unceremoniously', 'reveal', 'coronation', 'queen', 'flees', 'build', 'icy', 'winter', 'palace', 'high', 'mountain', 'anna', 'go', 'search', 'sister', 'meeting', 'kind', 'icemaker', 'kristoff', 'hardy', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'magical', 'troll', 'talk', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'join', 'quest', 'anna', 'mend', 'relationship', 'sister', 'discover', 'love', 'time', 'save', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'envelops', 'visuals', 'wintry', 'wonderland', 'animate', 'film', 'set', 'fantastically', 'render', 'part', 'elsa', 'building', 'palace', 'ice', 'wondrous', 'scene', 'inspire', 'awe', 'cute', 'character', 'may', 'write', 'like', 'way', 'drew', 'face', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'truth', 'tell', 'first', 'saw', 'olaf', 'trailer', 'almost', 'want', 'watch', 'whole', 'film', 'song', 'accompany', 'elsa', 'emancipation', 'entitle', 'let', 'go', 'breathtaking', 'sung', 'incomparable', 'voice', 'idina', 'menzel', 'easily', 'best', 'memorable', 'song', 'film', 'many', 'song', 'especially', 'anna', 'broadway', 'esque', 'sweep', 'melodic', 'troll', 'olaf', 'feature', 'quirky', 'song', 'though', 'cute', 'song', 'sound', 'place', 'rest', 'song', 'story', 'line', 'sisterly', 'love', 'devotion', 'also', 'novel', 'approach', 'make', 'production', 'stand', 'elsa', 'unique', 'interest', 'predicament', 'power', 'possess', 'would', 'well', 'think', 'film', 'center', 'anna', 'fact', 'film', 'two', 'female', 'heroine', 'make', 'appeal', 'young', 'female', 'demographic']","[530, 2, 5, 256, 44, 245, 339, 771, 114, 1868, 39, 49, 12, 42, 351, 327, 183, 1940, 1816, 786, 615, 1944, 4642, 1940, 336, 80, 14, 333, 132, 6, 39, 49, 372, 408, 14, 746, 1816, 72, 55, 5, 383, 1816, 1386, 1911, 3296, 1940, 71, 362, 748, 6, 359, 3516, 1944, 1940, 80, 336, 288, 39, 49, 858, 5, 156, 9, 12, 208, 19, 33, 383, 304, 80, 19, 5, 99, 62, 6, 111, 12, 4474, 200, 1088, 12, 3813, 230, 114, 42, 870, 15, 10, 4, 215, 702, 24, 134, 33, 1366, 986, 10, 7, 873, 498, 628, 15, 24, 378, 449, 1493, 480, 42, 1747, 98, 466, 4, 24, 528, 343, 49, 710, 202, 453, 105, 383, 206, 214, 7, 13, 793, 15, 1574, 193, 67, 151, 181, 170, 123, 178, 45, 183, 32, 813, 1527, 7, 2504, 153, 15, 987, 6, 20, 111, 77, 310, 105, 267, 1366, 1809, 38, 3, 144, 3415, 1254, 94, 4, 920, 383, 33, 2309, 90, 500, 2059, 265, 8, 171, 165, 9, 50, 3603, 381, 32, 45, 1690, 143, 36, 157, 32, 394, 173, 59, 23, 127, 3, 11, 1472, 4, 1868, 30, 13, 905, 684, 86, 141, 116, 403, 34, 268, 11, 3, 61, 11, 121, 7, 411, 1906, 2083, 3058, 123, 32, 229, 908, 11, 100, 265, 11, 259, 188, 303, 11, 12, 213, 711, 6, 4604, 27, 2637, 1111, 14, 700, 361, 4, 414, 122, 4338, 24, 2219, 26, 18, 37, 3, 649, 7, 201, 3, 42, 237, 565, 14, 484, 73, 237, 1645]"

739,7,"Currently, ""Frozen"" has a very high IMDb score of 8.1. I was actually surprised by this, as I did enjoy the film but though it had some plot problems that prevented it from being among Disney's best in recent years. Apparently, other folks don't agree with me.The film is supposedly based on Han Christian Andersen's story ""The Snow Queen"", however little of the finished film seems to be related to this story...very little. This isn't really a criticism--I am just trying to clarify the film a bit.The story is about two sisters--one who eventually becomes queen and one who is her younger sister, a princess. However, the Queen, Elsa (Idina Menzel), has a huge problem that is never really explained in the film--she has magical powers to make things frozen as well as to create snow. While this seems great, it's also a dangerous power and one she cannot fully control--and she COULD accidentally kill someone. Once she becomes queen, the power is exposed--and she disappears into the mountains to live life apart from others.The younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), decides to do what any responsible lady would do in this situation--abandon her kingdom and give control of it to an almost complete stranger! Why she didn't just send some of her people out to find Elsa is beyond me. Regardless, along the way she meets a guy who is to become an obvious love interest and together they seek out Elsa and try to bring her back to the kingdom. After all, since Elsa's departure, the place has been bathed in perpetual winter! The film is glorious to watch--particularly on the big screen. The CGI is absolutely lovely as are the character designs. However, it's a film that looks great but whose story is less than stellar. Part of it is because the characters sometimes do inexplicable things (mentioned above), part of it is because parts of the plot are missing (such as explaining how everyone LOVED the interim leader yet hated him later--after he'd actually done a good job in regard to the people as well as why everyone suddenly hated the guy from Weaseltown) and part of it is because there were too many distractions when the main thrust SHOULD have been the relationship between the sisters (the reindeer and guys got in the way). Still, it is worth seeing--especially if you don't spend too much time thinking through the plot. Plus, many might enjoy the more Broadway style of the music, as Idina Menzel really pours it on when she sings (as do the rest, though she clearly overshadows them with her magnificent singing).","['currently', 'frozen', 'high', 'imdb', 'score', 'actually', 'surprised', 'enjoy', 'film', 'though', 'plot', 'problem', 'prevent', 'among', 'disney', 'best', 'recent', 'year', 'apparently', 'folk', 'agree', 'film', 'supposedly', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'however', 'little', 'finish', 'film', 'seem', 'related', 'story', 'little', 'really', 'criticism', 'try', 'clarify', 'film', 'bit', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'one', 'eventually', 'becomes', 'queen', 'one', 'young', 'sister', 'princess', 'however', 'queen', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'huge', 'problem', 'never', 'really', 'explain', 'film', 'magical', 'power', 'make', 'thing', 'frozen', 'well', 'create', 'snow', 'seem', 'great', 'also', 'dangerous', 'power', 'one', 'fully', 'control', 'could', 'accidentally', 'kill', 'someone', 'becomes', 'queen', 'power', 'expose', 'disappears', 'mountain', 'live', 'life', 'apart', 'others', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'decides', 'responsible', 'lady', 'would', 'situation', 'abandon', 'kingdom', 'give', 'control', 'almost', 'complete', 'stranger', 'send', 'people', 'find', 'elsa', 'beyond', 'regardless', 'along', 'way', 'meet', 'guy', 'become', 'obvious', 'love', 'interest', 'together', 'seek', 'elsa', 'try', 'bring', 'back', 'kingdom', 'since', 'elsa', 'departure', 'place', 'bath', 'perpetual', 'winter', 'film', 'glorious', 'watch', 'particularly', 'big', 'screen', 'cgi', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'character', 'design', 'however', 'film', 'look', 'great', 'whose', 'story', 'less', 'stellar', 'part', 'character', 'sometimes', 'inexplicable', 'thing', 'mention', 'part', 'part', 'plot', 'miss', 'explain', 'everyone', 'love', 'interim', 'leader', 'yet', 'hat', 'later', 'actually', 'good', 'job', 'regard', 'people', 'well', 'everyone', 'suddenly', 'hat', 'guy', 'weaseltown', 'part', 'many', 'distraction', 'main', 'thrust', 'relationship', 'sister', 'reindeer', 'guy', 'get', 'way', 'still', 'worth', 'see', 'especially', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'think', 'plot', 'plus', 'many', 'might', 'enjoy', 'broadway', 'style', 'music', 'idina', 'menzel', 'really', 'pours', 'sings', 'rest', 'though', 'clearly', 'overshadows', 'magnificent', 'sing']","[1695, 5, 206, 866, 223, 103, 703, 91, 3, 100, 52, 198, 1264, 471, 2, 34, 399, 47, 755, 1417, 729, 3, 1290, 256, 44, 245, 339, 12, 39, 49, 110, 48, 855, 3, 75, 1312, 12, 48, 22, 1091, 87, 3, 95, 12, 42, 15, 10, 652, 380, 49, 10, 73, 15, 29, 110, 49, 4, 141, 116, 360, 198, 88, 22, 400, 3, 170, 24, 14, 43, 5, 18, 134, 39, 75, 25, 27, 702, 24, 10, 822, 128, 54, 300, 286, 304, 380, 49, 24, 1318, 3889, 214, 224, 79, 512, 247, 73, 15, 7, 162, 146, 996, 2511, 1599, 26, 867, 1622, 77, 57, 128, 173, 656, 1249, 1968, 46, 71, 4, 614, 1652, 172, 50, 244, 148, 179, 595, 6, 122, 332, 997, 4, 87, 221, 74, 77, 98, 4, 4274, 188, 4888, 1437, 105, 3, 1483, 23, 536, 106, 369, 555, 292, 765, 8, 424, 110, 3, 66, 25, 620, 12, 321, 2207, 94, 8, 504, 4889, 43, 348, 94, 94, 52, 271, 400, 109, 6, 1621, 182, 606, 358, 103, 17, 373, 902, 46, 18, 109, 1033, 606, 148, 94, 61, 1860, 119, 2424, 153, 15, 151, 148, 19, 50, 68, 254, 16, 121, 1031, 31, 20, 37, 52, 569, 61, 252, 91, 411, 355, 58, 141, 116, 22, 794, 303, 100, 690, 4169, 935, 63]"
740,8,"Frozen is a legitimately great film but also a flawed one.First, let's look at a few flaws, then admire its successes.Frozen's biggest shortcoming is in not making Elsa, its most interesting character, the main protagonist and main heroine of the movie. As it is, she is a co-protagonist, but Anna is given far more screen time.Yet Anna's story is nowhere near as interesting as is Elsa's. Where Anna merely seems bored and a little lonely at the beginning, we know that Elsa suffers terribly throughout her young life, in being forced to inhibit her emotions, live with the guilt of nearly killing her sister, and seclude herself, in order to protect Anna from the danger that her magic poses. Yet we barely see Elsa's side of the story.But when Elsa transforms into the Snow Queen during her Let It Go sequence, that's when we especially wish and expect to see more of her. That feels like a great beginning, a launching point for the character, from which Elsa will go on to have an exciting storyline in her new identity.But instead, the movie relentlessly keeps us down with Anna on what is a not very original or interesting road trip.It would be as if, in Beauty and the Beast, the movie spent most of its time not in the Beast's castle, but with Belle and some villager on a road trip to and from the castle (and the castle would lack any magical objects, and Belle and the Beast would never fall in love).Think of how much poorer a film that would have been, compared to the Beauty and the Beast movie that does exist, in which the very BEST moments are the moments in the Beast's castle and the scenes involving the Beast.Frozen deprives itself of those very scenes, which would have been the best in the film, for no reason whatsoever.But one could even forgive Frozen this, if it wasn't hindered by a second missed opportunity: It doesn't give Elsa a love interest, no prince to win her heart, no man to love, who would love her back.This is baffling and unforgivable. Countless Disney princesses have been given stirring love stories when they didn't particularly need them. But in Elsa, Disney created a character of aching solitude and isolation, one for whom a love story actually would have mattered. It would have been as beautiful and rapturous to see as is the Beast's love story in Beauty and the Beast.But it didn't.The ending of the film feels very disappointing for that reason, giving Elsa at best a glass-half-full conclusion, showing Anna (the sister who has suffered less) blessed with both sisterly reconciliation and romantic love, while Elsa's reward for a lifetime of self-sacrifice and pain is...merely survival, and a touch of equilibrium.On the other hand, the movie does a number of things very well.It keeps the setting in Scandinavia and populates the story with actual Scandinavians, instead of making Arendelle look demographically like a modern American metropolis.The animation is breathtakingly beautiful throughout. The depth of attention to detail, incorporating authentic Norwegian culture, is admirable, and one hopes that it might inspire Europeans and European-Americans to better appreciate their own heritages.Making Elsa the heroine of the story rather than the villain was truly inspired. This is the film's one, true claim to greatness. In fact, throughout the movie, Elsa is actually the moral center of the story. Every one of her actions is selfless and noble, even as other characters make morally questionable choices. Added to that, she is traditionally feminine in appearance and demeanor, so this film redeems such essential feminine qualities (which are otherwise often vilified or erased in modern culture) by giving them to its most popular character.Even more subversively, at many points in the story, the roles of the sisters reverse and it is actually Anna who becomes the antagonist to Elsa (as Elsa never is).Anna is the one who causes the accident in the girls' youth by goading Elsa into playing the game and not stopping when Elsa told her to do so.Anna takes Elsa's glove and refuses to give it back at a state function, throwing a tantrum in the middle of an important diplomatic affair, selfishly thinking only about her own wishes instead of how she is humiliating Arendelle itself. (It would be like the brother of the U.S. President throwing a tantrum toward the President on Inauguration Day.) And when Elsa tells Anna to leave the ice palace, Anna stubbornly refuses, agitating Elsa and causing the blast of magic.Time and again, Anna is Elsa's antagonist, a situation that only changes at the end of the film, when Anna finally makes a selfless act – the kind of selfless act that Elsa has been making her whole life, in sacrificing her happiness for the safety and well-being of others. Finally, at the end, Anna learns the lesson that Elsa's example has provided to her.Beyond that, the Hans twist is unnecessary, and the scene of his turn is incongruously melodramatic, his monologuing almost self-parodic.Nevertheless, Elsa's ""Let It Go"" sequence is among the finest moments ever created in Disney history, and as a whole, the film is visually breathtaking.Frozen is a magnificent move even as it is, but with a re-emphasis on its most captivating character, Elsa, it could have been a true masterpiece.","['frozen', 'legitimately', 'great', 'film', 'also', 'flaw', 'one', 'first',

741,6,"It is sort of disheartening going into Disney's production of ""Frozen"" to report that this is a project that Walt himself had been tinkering with as far back as the 40s, disheartening because the result falls far short of spectacular. After all these years, after all this effort, what has come to the screen is a dull, lackluster and fairly canned story that Uncle Walt would have most certainly demanded be rewritten.What comes to the screen looks terrific. The animation is crisp and colorful. The ice-flows glisten in a magical way, but the story is disastrously underwritten. It plays like one of Disney's quickly-made DVD releases, or one of those classic fairy tales starring Barbie. Worse, it has musical numbers that are not only forgettable; they slow down the film's forward momentum. They're bad, and that ain't good.Loosely based on the Hans Christian Anderson 1845 tale ""The Snow Queen"", the story takes place in the Nordic kingdom of Arendelle where Elsa (Idina Menzel) is born with a superpower that she doesn't want: Everything she touches turns to ice. With this gift, her royal parents reasonably do what any Disney parent would do, by keeping her power a secret and locking her up in her bedroom for life. Who wouldn't? Elsa's cold-weather Midas Touch eventually gets her banished from the kingdom when a wintry temper tantrum leads to disaster. Cast out into the cold, she heads off into the mountains where she builds herself a lonely castle in which to stew in her misery. Meanwhile, the winter-wonderland that she has left in her wake is (unbeknownst to her) turning out to be permanent.That sets her sister Anna (Kristen Bell) off into the frozen wilderness to bring her disgraced sibling back. Her sidekicks include a hunky guide named Kristoff who runs an ice business, and a living, breathing snow man named Olaf (Josh Gad).Olaf would seem to be the film's chief selling point. He's a cute motor-mouth with a silly wish that, given his molecular configuration, might prove fatal - he's unaware that snow melts in summer. Olaf is not one of the great Disney sidekicks. Unlike Goofy or The Genie or Dug the Dog, Olaf just feels manufactured and underwritten. He's also pointless to the rest of the story. He shows up halfway through the movie, sings a song and then has nowhere to go.That's pretty much the problem with the entire movie. For everything right with the movie – the beautiful wintry landscapes – there is something that goes wrong – all the characters look like a line of Barbie dolls.

742,-,"I'm an 18 year old girl, who is a HUGE Disney fan and loves watching what her friends deem ""little kid movies"". I was looking for a way to celebrate finishing my first semester at college(in December), so I went to see Frozen, which had gotten great reviews. The beginning of the movie was decent. Do You Want to Build a Snowman made me tear up and Kristen Bell and Santino Fontana's voices sounded like they were made for each other in Love is an Open Door. However, the positivity stops there. At the end of Love is an Open Door, when Prince Hans asks Anna to marry him, I immediately KNEW that something was wrong and that this was an attempt to mock the Disney ""love-at- first-sight"" cliché. Now, before I continue, I'd just like to point out that I am ridiculously sick of people praising Elsa for being the first Disney princess to say ""You can't marry a man you just met"".1) This is a result of people on the internet poking fun at Disney Princess movies. However, if those people even bothered to REALLY watch them, they'd realize that although this movie may be the first to explicitly state that girls shouldn't marry someone they just met, this is not a new concept in the Disney world. In fact, I don't recall Pocahontas, Mulan, Rapunzel, Tiana, Jasmine, or Belle marrying men that they just met. 2) Re-watch that scene. She only said that because she was worried about Hans' brothers staying over for the wedding and having yet another social event that she'd be required to attend. She panics and says ""No one's brothers are staying here. No one's getting married"". See her priorities? Elsa's reason for not blessing their marriage doesn't stem from their quick engagement. It's much more self-centered than that. Next, let's not forget the plot holes, the most obvious one being the anti-climatic ending: ""Of course...Love!"" Sorry, what? Elsa trying to protect Anna from herself wasn't love? Besides, why does Elsa even have powers? Why are there trolls and where did they come from? Why did Prince Hans protect Elsa if he wanted her dead? He could have been ""distracted"" when the guard was trying to kill Elsa. Why does Olaf come to life and where has he been the entire time the girls were growing up? Maybe the directors should have paid less attention to casting *famous* people and more to making a good plot. (Casting complaint: Elsa looked like she was in her mid-twenties and sounded old enough to be Anna's mother.)Anyways, moving on to my next complaint: Olaf, the snowman AKA my least favorite character in the entire movie. His awkward attempts at jokes and sheer stupidity were torturous to sit through. In Summer was one of the worst songs in the movie, right up there with Fixer Upper. What is Fixer Upper even promoting? Cheating?!?! Because that's what I thought as the trolls sang about getting Anna's fiancé out of the way. Also, I could not stand how Anna flirted with and almost MARRIED Kristoff while engaged to Hans. Luckily for her, Prince Hans just *happened* to be a villain. How very convenient (and completely unnecessary). Elsa, having been alone her entire life, could have used a love story and Kristoff would have been the perfect match for her. Elsa and Kristoff could have bonded over her powers and his love for ice. Instead, Kristoff and Anna ended up being an extremely weak, unlikeable rip-off of Flynn and Rapunzel. Lastly, having watched Disney movies all my life, I have to say, this movie has the largest percentage of bad songs I've ever seen in a single movie. ""Let it Go"" is the most overrated song I have EVER heard and I was quite disappointed to hear that it had won the Oscar for Best Original Song. The rhymes were unoriginal and it was not memorable at all, although after hearing people sing it 24/7, it does get ingrained into your brain. Some of the other songs were catchy, but there was still a HUGE lack of originality in the rhymes. Even my nine-year-old sister criticized the Frozen songwriters' creativity, pointing out that they rhymed ""door"" and ""anymore"" in four songs (""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"", ""For the First Time in Forever"", ""Love is an Open Door"", and ""Let it Go""). To summarize, this movie was not deserving of the Oscars it won. Then again, there was not much competition this year. This movie was basically a slap in the face to all the Classic Disney Princess movies and is tied for #1 with Brave on my Worst Disney Princess Movies list. If you REALLY want to see a movie worth watching, I recommend Tangled, which is as underrated as Frozen is overrated. The songs, plot, and characters are much better developed and the whole movie is absolutely delightful. The music was beautifully composed and don't even get me started on how amazing Donna Murphy, Zachary Levi, and Mandy Moore's performances were! Whereas I will never re-watch Frozen, I re-watch Tangled every couple of months even though I can quote the entire movie and sing every song. I know many Tangled fans went to see Frozen - expecting it to be as good as Tangled- and were very disappointed. Disney may be gaining new fans, but they're losing their loyal fans. Look at Frozen's percentage of 1/10 ratings compared to those of Tangled. Until Disney gets their act together, I will not be wasting any more of my time watching these movies in theaters. As Zazu said, ""If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out"".tl;dr- Plot holes galore. Lackluster songs. Terrible morals/lessons. Save your money and time.(Apparently 0/10 is not an option, so I'll give it one point for the animation.)","['year', 'old', 'girl', 'huge', 'disney', 'fan', 'love', 'watch', 'friend', 'deem',

743,3,"Let me start this off by saying that I generally like Disney films, and that this is not some anti-kiddie flick internet geek writing this. Now that I have that out of the way, I would like to tell you how terrible this movie is. First of all, there is only one song that I think was actually good. The first song in the film is a fantastic number about the hardships of winter, with a great track, expert vocals and a grand, sweeping tone. The rest of the songs are not nearly so good, as they are all sung by the protagonists, which is fine the first few times but gets really monotonous by about halfway through. The movie also wasn't especially funny, which is a saving grace in some of Disney's other lackluster releases. The comic relief character was okay (in that he wasn't nearly as annoying as everyone else) but he was only there to provide some moderately executed slapstick comedy, and the only funny spoken line in the movie. While the script is fine for a TV special or maybe the first episode of a Nickelodeon series, it is definitely not right for a high-profile animated film. Let's just say, there are trolls. Singing, incredibly annoying trolls who show up basically just for the hell of it, and then disappear without a trace. And, while there was one character turn which was actually quite well executed, it is wasted almost immediately, because it changes absolutely nothing about the story. No events drastically alter because of it, there's no clever subtext, and the entire thing feels like it was just inserted so the screenwriter could show how clever he was. I mean, the trip to the cinemas wasn't completely pointless.

744,1,"(Spoilers) At one time, sisters Elsa and Anna knew of and loved to utilize Elsa's (unexplained, apparently genetic? even though no one else in her family has them) ice powers. Then an accident and a warning by the (ostensibly) wise troll – that fear will make Elsa's powers dangerous – prompts her parents to fearfully seclude her, shutting her away from everyone and isolating her from her sister. The trolls erase Anna's memory of Elsa's powers. (No one apparently considers the implications of seclusion and terror regarding the power). The girls grow up. After their parents die at sea, Elsa becomes queen. For her coronation, the kingdom is opened. Prince Hans and the Duke of Weselton are among the visiting dignitaries. Anna promptly falls in love with the prince, and agrees to marry him. When the queen refuses to condone her sister's impetuous match, they argue and Elsa accidentally reveals her powers, prompting the Duke to demand that she be arrested. Elsa flees, accidentally shrouding the world in ""eternal winter"" and leaving in power Anna, who promptly follows after her – appointing Prince Hans to rule in her stead (!!!). Apparently in this world, chains of command, diplomatic decorum, and other such trifles cease to exist. Anna loses her horse, and then teams up with a poor boy named Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. They all end up working with Olaf, a quirky snow creation of Elsa's, to find her sister. A romance blossoms between Kristoff and the fickle Anna. Meanwhile, Elsa has embraced her ""bad girl"" image (complete with sultry walk/slit up the thigh), building herself a lovely snow palace. The girls talk. Things don't go well, and Anna ends up with ""ice in her heart"" (which the trolls, long ago, had warned would kill her but for an act of true love). In the meantime, Anna's horse had returned to the city, and Hans and a group of soldiers go looking for her. They arrive just after Anna, Kristoff and co are expelled. Weselton's men attack her, a fight breaks out, etc. Elsa is captured. Kristoff, meanwhile, reveals that he had been adopted by trolls – the same ones, coincidentally, that had offered their advice to her family years before. The trolls explain that only an act of true love can save Anna. Kristoff and Anna race back to Hans, for a Kiss of True Love (TM). Kristoff delivers her and leaves. Hans reveals – gasp – that he has simply been after the throne all this time, and locks her in a room to freeze to death. He then claims to the ruling council that Anna is dead, but that they had been married before she expired (witnesses, marriage certificates and funerals apparently don't exist in this world either)...so that makes him king. They welcome him with open arms. Thankfully, there are no other heirs, distant relatives, or people who remember that they still have a queen alive (!!) around. He (with no explanation) believes he can get Elsa to turn back winter. Meanwhile, Kristoff and Sven are coming back because, true love. Elsa, in her grief at learning of Anna's supposed death, accidentally unleashes a tornado-strength blizzard. Kristoff and Anna are going to kiss, but Anna sees Prince Hans about to murder Elsa. She intervenes, and almost freezes; but, that being an act of true love, she is saved. At this point, Elsa figures out how to recall winter (""Love!"" - that's it, no explanation). Pros: - Pretty. Frozen is very pretty, very glitzy, full of beautiful landscapes, amazing snow shots and glamorous gowns. Different. It has a different feel, architecturally and culturally, from many of the preceding princess films, which is nice. Cons: Pretty much everything else. The story was inconsistent. If you read about the series of ""development hells"" that preceded its release, it makes sense. They had no clue where they were going with this, and it very much felt like it at times: these were different ideas, different takes on the same story, all jumbled together. Character immaturity/stupidity. If you, like, can see this being a classic, then, like, whatever, because classic Disney princes andPlot idiocy. This ties into the first point. If fear is the enemy, why do you seclude/terrorize the princess with insecurities? How/why does ""love"" recall winter? Didn't Elsa love her family all along? Wasn't there ""love"" present all this time? There was zero explanation for how this worked. Just ""love"". Not to mention the flouting of anything like court customs, diplomacy, etc.: random foreign dignitaries are giving orders to arrest and kill the queen, foreign princes are left in charge of the kingdom, etc. Or the cringe worthiness of the trolls, and their irrelevance to the plot; and the fact that Hans never mentions having witnessed the royal family's first encounter with the trolls/how Anna's memory was wiped (Elsa also ignores this). The list goes on. Predictability. The scene where Anna and Hans meet was terribly predictable, and just...terrible. The scene where Anna and Kristoff meet was equally predictable. The betrayal was predictable. The conclusion was predictable despite being completely unexplained.Music. The music was of an exceptionally poor caliber in this film. The singers were overpowered by the instruments, the lyrics were indistinguishable, the songs out of place and silly, and often-times just cringe inducing (it's pretty bad when you're cannibalizing themes from your own previous films, like the troll rip-off of Hunchback's ""A Guy Like You"", and you completely, utterly blow it...)Little kids will enjoy the prettiness of it all. Anyone who thinks about the plot, though, is going to end up with a headache. Certainly anyone who listens to the music. (And don't get me started on the rape-y Mickey/Minnie/Pete short that preceded the film. Yikes.)","['spoiler', 'one', 'time', 'sister', 'elsa', 'anna', 'knew', 'love', 'utilize', 'elsa', 'unexplained', 'apparently', 'genetic', 'even', 'though', 'one', 'else', 'family', 'ice', 'power',

746,1,"By ""worst Disney movie"" I do not mean the worst movie ever made. I hold Disney to a higher standard. So when I saw this film, with all of its hype, I came out of it not only disappointed, but utterly frustrated. This film, save its visuals, does very little right.So when we think of Disney, we think of a few major plot devices: the predictable romance, the villain who drives the conflict, and the moral that the film presents. Unfortunately this movie fails in all of these regards.Regarding romance it surprisingly includes it in the tale. I know Disney makes alterations to classic fairy tales, and often adds romance to enliven them, but the Snow Queen is an exception to the rule. The focus of the tale is not on the romantic element, but the mystery of the Snow Queen, and the mysterious mirror that reflects evil in souls. This concept alone is fascinating, but is never portrayed in the movie. When making adaption of the tale (and there have been many attempts, mind you) this element has to be kept in mind.I'm often a fan of a Disney alteration, but unfortunately, this is not an easy story to adapt. I can see why Walt Disney put the project on hold, and Disney itself did not revive in during the Renaissance. The relationship between Elsa and Anna is poor and often non-existent, considering the parents strangely agree to wipe Anna's memory and thus destroy the relationship between the sisters. Arguably, this upbringing is an unintentional villain in the story.And regarding the villain, the film should be about Hans. Hans is the most interesting and compassionate character in the film, but they decide to antagonize him for the cliché desire for power. The twist is poorly thought out, because while it is supposed to debunk Disney's banal attempts to incorporate ""true love"" romance into their films, this was not the film to be doing it. Often times characters will develop a relationship in Disney's films; the only exceptions are Grimm fairy tales in which romance drives the story. We're supposed to hate Hans by film's end, even though he has arguably the worst motivation in Disney history. He has many brothers, and wants to take over a kingdom? I'd say let him, he shows more superior leadership traits than either Anna or Elsa.Anna and Elsa would be ineffective leaders anyways. Anna delegates power to (arguably better leaders) but still outside of the bloodline (didn't they have a regent or something? There's a time-gap in the film that explains very little of Arendelle). Elsa evades her responsibilities as queen, freezes the kingdom over, and forces her people to the brink of starvation, and they love her in the end? That doesn't make much sense to me. Hans' idea to charge Elsa with treason at least is more justified than anything Anna has to bargain with; Hans is a much stronger character.The moral is designed to be a feminist sympathy, which fails horribly. It is ironic that in a so-called ""feminist"" movie that encourages ""lesbianism"" (in Elsa's case)that the female characters are even worse than in traditional fairy tales. Elsa and Anna are annoying, stupid, and take little accountability for their actions. I suppose the message was supposed to be ""love your sibling"" and all the fluffy, Disney crap but it seems like last minute drivel. And to make this movie even more unbearable, they have to denigrate the male population, with side villains such as the Duke of Wesselton, who is made to be scrawny, but notoriously crafty politician, sworn to ""cheat"" the poorly elected leadership. Hell, at least he knows foreign policy and economics. What do Elsa and Anna know about the politics of the kingdom? They were sheltered for fifteen years! If I were the citizens of the kingdom, I'd sure as hell overthrow Elsa and Anna's regime. At least Hans and Wesselton can run a freaking kingdom properly.All in all, Frozen is lucky the Academy plays to the fancy of whatever's popular and dynastic, as Frozen defeated several films who are probably equally deserving or far succeed it. I have not seen Miyazaki's ""The Wind Rises"" but I must say his films are probably better and more fascinating than most Disney films (save Hunchback of Notre Dame or The Lion King). Frozen is a terrible movie, and in my opinion, should be giving its academy award to the people who devise better stories than this one.**EDIT** I have seen Miyazaki's The Wind Rises, and I must say that in about ten minutes (the Earthquake scene) I got a better story and a better display of character than in the whole hour and forty minutes of Frozen. Shame on Disney for making such a shallow movie. I am sure I am not alone in advocating Disney to return its Oscar to Miyazaki, whose film is miles ahead of this pile of ***.","['bad', 'disney', 'movie', 'mean', 'bad', 'movie', 'ever', 'make',

747,1,"This is one of the worst movies of the entire season! The storyline was not well-thought out. Considering they shelved the project multiple times and only picked it up again after the success of Tangled, they should have shelved it again until they further thought out the storyline! Frozen's singers don't cut it. I don't mind pop singers like in Tangled, Princess Frog and Brave, but these ones were just bad! You literally struggle to hear them over the instruments that are playing during the songs they sing. During some songs, it sounds as if the singers sometimes practically give up on singing altogether and just shout. There's a duet of the sisters in particular that I'm referring to (For The First Time in Forever (Reprise)). The animation and audio quality did not match the songs. This is most evident in the song Let It Go. The words don't match the lip movement, and the audio sounds out of place.*****WARNING!!! SPOILERS!!!******** Due to Elsa's inability to properly harness her powers, she nearly kills her little sister. The king and queen take both sisters to some wise trolls who heal the little girl and then warn the parents that the powers will grow. They tell them that if she doesn't learn to control them, there will be grave consequences. The trolls then explain that fear will be her enemy. It can hinder her ability to cope with these powers. These wise and caring parents come to the brilliant conclusion that it's a good idea to completely seclude the princess from everyone. Of course it never occurred to them that this might cause her to be more fearful than ever.. They even seal off the castle. Then they leave the two fearful, confused children on their own (with no precautionary measures in place to help the cursed princess should they perish) while they go on a little cruise and drown. This absurdity continues with Elsa (the ice queen) accidentally revealing her powers in front of a foreign dignitary from a small kingdom who then orders her soldiers to arrest their own queen. I mean, do I really need to explain how stupid that is? The young princess then searches for her fleeing sister and leaves the kingdom in the charge of a young prince she has a crush on rather than a trusted aid or prime minster or any other sort of government official. After a typical Disney ""love conquers all"" moment, the curse of eternal winter (the winter was inexplicably determined to be eternal after about one night) is lifted by the ice queen who before was unable to remove it. How? They don't really explain. They merely have her exclaim, ""Of course! Love!"" That makes no sense of course because she always loved her kingdom and her sister. If love is the cure then it would have never happened in the first place. Whatever.Now my biggest complaint. The way women (and the ice queen in particular) were portrayed. There were only four women that had any prominence throughout the movie. Number one: the ice queen's mother. Remember those really stupid parents I talked about earlier? She was one of them. And it was the father who did the talking, who spent the intimate moments with both the children, etc. She might as well not have been there. There's the troll mother who embarrasses her son and generally acts like a hare-brain. Then there are the two sisters Anna the princess and Elsa the ice queen. Anna is a ditz who falls in love with- and determines to marry- a guy she's only known for a few hours. Elsa is a strong girl who's actually highly emotional and perpetually frightened like a mouse. But don't worry. She later turns against the way she was raised and determines to stop being a good girl. She then proceeds to walk down the hall like a Victoria's Secret model with a large slit in her dress deliberately placed to show as much leg as possible. Nearly all other women shown are intentionally made to be fat and unattractive. So what can we gather from this? Women are mostly undesirable, and those that are desirable are only desirable for their bodies or raising your kids. Do you remember Beauty and the Beast? I remember Belle for being brilliant, beautiful, and brave. But hey, Anna and Elsa are both beautiful. One out of three ain't bad, eh? *face palm*The trolls were predictable and uninspired. The way the characters talked, in this, like, totally, like modern teen, like way, was like, yeanot cool.All in all, 1/10 stars. They should have shelved it until they had worked out their story more instead of releasing it prematurely to make a quick buck!","['one', 'bad', 'movie', 'entire', 'season', 'storyline', 'well',

748,1,"I was so angry after watching this movie that I had to make an IMDb account just to write this review. This is HANDS DOWN the WORST Disney movie I have ever watched. Why is it getting so much praise? Beats me, but it seems that today's moviegoers are extremely easily pleased. I, on the other hand, am embarrassed for Disney for having released such a terrible movie. I am even MORE embarrassed for the Academy Awards which presented this terrible movie with TWO Oscars. Do people even have standards anymore? The animation for this movie was wonderful (but so is every other Disney movie's), but there was absolutely nothing else about this movie that was enjoyable. The worst part of the movie was the plot twist, which was not only unnecessary, but extremely cynical. Why did the directors feel the need to put down other Disney princesses who fell in love? It's not like they were bad romances. Prince Hans was probably my favorite character (especially after finding out that he was a villain). He was a terrible villain and the twist seemed like it was put in just so that Anna could end up with Kristoff without having to dump Hans. Well, I say, if Hans wants to rule Arendelle, LET HIM. He's a much more caring and compassionate ruler than both Elsa and Anna. The townspeople haven't seen either of them in years and both of them desert the kingdom and leave it in the hands of a stranger, without a second thought. Meanwhile, Hans hands out blankets to the people and treats them kindly. I know if I had been a commoner living in Arendelle, I would've been so disappointed and upset that Elsa and Anna came back.Speaking of Anna, that girl got on my nerves to no end. What was with the outright awkwardness? I understand having a slightly awkward princess (like Rapunzel) but Anna's character felt forced. I don't know a single person who could relate to her level of awkwardness. Plus, that girl is so boy-crazy, it's absolutely ridiculous. What other Disney princess dates two different men in the course of two or three days? Absolutely disgusting. This is such an accurate reflection of modern society's morals. Disney princess movies are supposed to be FAIRY TALES. Of course, in reality, girls probably aren't going to find their dream guy on their first date, but what's wrong with portraying that ideal in a FAIRY TALE? If Disney is really trying to make their movies imitate real life by creating an evil Prince Charming, then shouldn't they also create a movie about a tone-deaf princess who CAN'T sing? What about an acne-riddled princess? Disney princess movies portray an idealized version of life for kids, which is why they're so enjoyable. Stop being so cynical. Unfortunately, I ended up paying to watch a movie that ended up being about how you shouldn't marry a guy you just met, because that's definitely a moral that we didn't already know (* rolls eyes *). I don't think any person who watched old Disney princess movies ever thought, ""Hey, you know, I really think I should marry this person I just met because it worked out so well for Snow White!"" The moral about loving your family was sweet, but could have been done without making fun of romantic love. And, ughhh, the songs. Songs are what Disney movies are known for, yet the songs in this movie ended up being mediocre at best. They were so repetitive. Blah blah blah love. Blah blah blah door. Blah blah blah gate. Blah blah blah anymore. I feel like those words were in every. single. freaking. song. The voice acting, for the most part, was decent. Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) had a surprisingly princess-like voice. Prince Hans' voice was equally wonderful (if not more so). Unfortunately, Elsa's voice did not match her animated character AT ALL. //END RANT//","['angry', 'watch', 'movie', 'make', 'imdb', 'account', 'write', 'review', 'hand', 'bad', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'watch', 'get', 'much', 'praise', 'beat', 'seem', 'today', 'moviegoer', 'extremely', 'easily', 'pleased', 'hand', 'embarrass', 'disney', 'release', 'terrible', 'movie', 'even', 'embarrass', 'academy', 'award', 'present', 'terrible', 'movie', 'two', 'oscar', 'people', 'even', 'standard', 'anymore', 'animation', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'every', 'disney', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'bad', 'part', 'movie', 'plot', 'twist', 'unnecessary', 'extremely', 'cynical', 'director', 'feel', 'need', 'put', 'disney', 'princess', 'fell', 'love', 'like', 'bad', 'romance', 'prince', 'han', 'probably', 'favorite', 'character', 'especially', 'find', 'villain', 'terrible', 'villain', 'twist', 'seem', 'like', 'put', 'anna', 'could', 'end', 'kristoff', 'without', 'dump', 'han', 'well', 'say', 'han', 'want', 'rule', 'arendelle', 'let', 'much', 'care', 'compassionate', 'ruler', 'elsa', 'anna', 'townspeople', 'see', 'either', 'year', 'desert', 'kingdom', 'leave', 'hand', 'stranger', 'without', 'second', 'thought', 'meanwhile', 'han', 'hand', 'blanket', 'people', 'treat', 'kindly', 'know', 'commoner', 'living', 'arendelle', 'would', 'disappointed', 'upset', 'elsa', 'anna', 'come', 'back', 'speak', 'anna', 'girl', 'get', 'nerve', 'end', 'outright', 'awkwardness', 'understand', 'slightly', 'awkward', 'princess', 'like', 'rapunzel', 'anna', 'character', 'felt', 'force', 'know', 'single', 'person', 'could', 'relate', 'level', 'awkwardness', 'plus', 'girl', 'boy', 'crazy', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'disney', 'princess', 'date', 'two', 'different', 'men', 'course', 'two', 'three', 'day', 'absolutely', 'disgust', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'modern', 'society', 'moral', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'suppose', 'fairy', 'tale', 'course', 'reality', 'girl', 'probably', 'go', 'find', 'dream', 'guy', 'first', 'date', 'wrong', 'portray', 'ideal', 'fairy', 'tale', 'disney', 'really', 'try', 'make', 'movie', 'imitate', 'real', 'life', 'create', 'evil', 'prince', 'charm', 'also', 'create', 'movie', 'tone', 'deaf', 'princess', 'sing', 'acne', 'riddle', 'princess', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'portray', 'idealize', 'version', 'life', 'kid', 'enjoyable', 'stop', 'cynical', 'unfortunately', 'end', 'pay', 'watch', 'movie', 'end', 'marry', 'guy', 'met', 'definitely', 'moral', 'already', 'know', 'roll', 'eye', 'think', 'person', 'watch', 'old', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'ever', 'thought', 'hey', 'know', 'really', 'think', 'marry', 'person', 'met', 'work', 'well', 'snow', 'white', 'moral', 'love', 'family', 'sweet', 'could', 'without', 'make', 'fun', 'romantic', 'love', 'ughhh', 'song', 'song', 'disney', 'movie', 'know', 'yet', 'song', 'movie', 'end', 'mediocre', 'best', 'repetitive', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'love', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'door', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'gate', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'anymore', 'feel', 'like', 'word', 'every', 'single', 'freak', 'song', 'voice', 'act', 'part', 'decent', 'anna', 'voiced', 'kristen', 'bell', 'surprisingly', 'princess', 'like', 'voice', 'prince', 'han', 'voice', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'unfortunately', 'elsa', 'voice', 'match', 'animate', 'character', 'end', 'rant']","[2162, 23, 1, 14, 866, 1732, 165, 161, 323, 65, 2, 1, 81, 23, 19, 31, 535, 1167, 75, 674, 3432, 423, 403, 1515, 323, 1989, 2, 288, 432, 1, 28, 1989, 856, 469, 663, 432, 1, 42, 302, 46, 28, 633, 892, 21, 1, 215, 115, 2, 1, 292, 156, 270, 1, 306, 65, 94, 1, 52, 129, 845, 423, 2095, 770, 53, 99, 196, 2, 29, 843, 6, 9, 65, 363, 82, 44, 210, 189, 8, 121, 71, 104, 432, 104, 129, 75, 9, 196, 7, 54, 41, 67, 137, 44, 18, 35, 44, 59, 788, 199, 30, 31, 293, 3117, 3899, 4, 7, 2292, 16, 353, 47, 4293, 77, 322, 323, 1249, 137, 319, 92, 1104, 44, 323, 3488, 46, 682, 4936, 56, 3466, 704, 199, 26, 476, 1320, 4, 7, 40, 74, 641, 7, 76, 19, 2432, 41, 3002, 2510, 216, 774, 810, 29, 9, 527, 7, 8, 155, 272, 56, 741, 441, 54, 785, 440, 2510, 569, 76, 408, 1008, 292, 1195, 2, 29, 927, 42, 140, 459, 228, 42, 433, 138, 292, 1733, 2754, 2305, 324, 943, 551, 2, 29, 1, 473, 219, 114, 228, 940, 76, 210, 13, 71, 626, 148, 36, 927, 280, 1018, 2829, 219, 114, 2, 22, 87, 14, 1, 4205, 195, 79, 134, 277, 82, 235, 27, 134, 1, 627, 29, 63, 3106, 29, 2, 29, 1, 1018, 4360, 435, 79, 60, 306, 284, 2095, 573, 41, 963, 23, 1, 41, 390, 148, 392, 174, 551, 397, 56, 985, 336, 37, 441, 23, 64, 2, 29, 1, 81, 92, 1346, 56, 22, 37, 390, 441, 392, 107, 18, 39, 365, 551, 6, 72, 457, 54, 137, 14, 125, 393, 6, 11, 11, 2, 1, 56, 182, 11, 1, 41, 752, 34, 1982, 953, 953, 953, 6, 953, 953, 953, 478, 953, 953, 953, 964, 953, 953, 953, 892, 53, 9, 548, 115, 741, 1160, 11, 86, 112, 94, 546, 7, 521, 162, 146, 1179, 29, 9, 86, 82, 44, 86, 1169, 215, 573, 4, 86, 553, 38, 8, 41, 2865]"

750,3,"I have a couple of issues with the messages in this movie. The music The plot holes The execution of the ''True Love''OK. This movie to me is very overrated along with its ''Let it Go'' theme song. What happened to Disney after the 90s? None of the songs are that great the way there hyped up to be. No way does the music measure up to, The Lion King, Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid etc etc. The day Anna is able to go outside the castle, she falls in love with Hans ,some prince she bumped into. Long story short, She asks for Elsas blessing to get married to Hans. Elsa says no '' You can't just get married to some guy you just met''. AH here we go with the feminist fantasy. The entire movie is full of mocking love at first sight. Why? Princess stories that have love at first sight in them aren't as evil as people think. Their Fairy tales. There called make believe stories for a reason. Not to be taken so seriously like a woman's whole life depends on it. (Because Cinderella is the reason Miley Cyrus turned out the way she did). Later on in the movie Anna gets hurt by Elsa and the only way to save Anna is with the power of true love. Everyone in the movie thinks '' OK so that means go get Hans so Anna and him can kiss and save Anna from her death'' the plot goes on to make Hans a villain. Because a Prince Charming can actually be a bad guy ladies. Hans true motives all along were to take over Elsas throne and kingdom for himself using Anna. He tries to kill both Anna and Elsa to fulfill his master-plan. It doesn't work out, Anna saved the day by stopping the blow of his sword before it reached Elsa. So shes saved from being a ice sculpture forever with Elsas love, Anna sacrificed herself for Elsa instead of kissing Kristoff. (This other love interest). Past princess movies like Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping beauty, both needed a True loves kiss in order to break their curses. So why make so much fun about it? The Evil Queen and Maleficent specifically said that the only way to break there curses, was by TRUE LOVES KISS. The end. So for everyone making fun, go back and re-watch the movies. It wasn't the princesses fault they were cursed or that the only way for there curses to be broken was through a kiss. This is what I can't stand the most out of this movie. It pretty much put down falling in love at first sight and true loves kiss saves the day, while putting itself on top. Couldn't the movie be done without all the feminist preaching? ''True love is between family not some guy you just met a few hours ago, Prince charming can really be just a bad guy. You should focus on you relationship with your family instead of being a lovesick girl devoting you time to a guy.'' Oh my how realistic and reassuring. Is this movie suppose to be aimed at drunk tourist at Las Vegas? Who gets married after a few hours of meeting someone in real life? Of course you have to date for a while before even uttering the word love. Women and men alike know this. We aren't that clueless and dense. In the real world I actually have to work and go to college. Unlike Anna and Elsa... talk about a reality check. Princesses are usually privileged. Being daughters of Kings and Queens. Or their women who marry princes. Either way you look at it 99% of the female population naturally doesn't fit in. Does it make it such a bad thing? No. Fairy tales are just that. And we simpletons know this. Hell... people have sex before love. Live together for years and still look at each other wondering if they want to spend the rest of their lives with that person. Lets get over being cynical with the old school princess stories and enjoy them for what they were.","['couple', 'issue', 'message', 'movie', 'music', 'plot', 'hole', 'execution', 'true', 'love', 'ok', 'movie', 'overrate', 'along', 'let', 'go', 'theme', 'song', 'happen', 'disney', 'none', 'song', 'great', 'way', 'hyped', 'way', 'music', 'measure', 'lion', 'king', 'beauty', 'beast', 'aladdin', 'little', 'mermaid', 'etc', 'etc', 'day', 'anna', 'able', 'go', 'outside', 'castle', 'fall', 'love', 'han', 'prince', 'bumped', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'asks', 'elsas', 'blessing', 'get', 'married', 'han', 'elsa', 'say', 'get', 'married', 'guy', 'met', 'ah', 'go', 'feminist', 'fantasy', 'entire', 'movie', 'full', 'mock', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'princess', 'story', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'evil', 'people', 'think', 'fairy', 'tale', 'call', 'make', 'believe', 'story', 'reason', 'take', 'seriously', 'like', 'woman', 'whole', 'life', 'depends', 'cinderella', 'reason', 'miley', 'cyrus', 'turn', 'way', 'later', 'movie', 'anna', 'get', 'hurt', 'elsa', 'way', 'save', 'anna', 'power', 'true', 'love', 'everyone', 'movie', 'think', 'ok', 'mean', 'go', 'get', 'han', 'anna', 'kiss', 'save', 'anna', 'death', 'plot', 'go', 'make', 'han', 'villain', 'prince', 'charm', 'actually', 'bad', 'guy', 'lady', 'han', 'true', 'motif', 'along', 'take', 'elsas', 'throne', 'kingdom', 'use', 'anna', 'try', 'kill', 'anna', 'elsa', 'fulfill', 'master', 'plan', 'work', 'anna', 'save', 'day', 'stop', 'blow', 'sword', 'reach', 'elsa', 'shes', 'save', 'ice', 'sculpture', 'forever', 'elsas', 'love', 'anna', 'sacrifice', 'elsa', 'instead', 'kiss', 'kristoff', 'love', 'interest', 'past', 'princess', 'movie', 'like', 'snow', 'white', 'seven', 'dwarf', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'need', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'order', 'break', 'curse', 'make', 'much', 'fun', 'evil', 'queen', 'maleficent', 'specifically', 'say', 'way', 'break', 'curse', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'end', 'everyone', 'make', 'fun', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', 'princess', 'fault', 'curse', 'way', 'curse', 'broken', 'kiss', 'stand', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'put', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'save', 'day', 'put', 'top', 'movie', 'without', 'feminist', 'preach', 'true', 'love', 'family', 'guy', 'met', 'hour', 'ago', 'prince', 'charm', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'focus', 'relationship', 'family', 'instead', 'lovesick', 'girl', 'devote', 'time', 'guy', 'oh', 'realistic', 'reassure', 'movie', 'suppose', 'aim', 'drunk', 'tourist', 'la', 'vega', 'get', 'married', 'hour', 'meeting', 'someone', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'date', 'even', 'utter', 'word', 'love', 'woman', 'men', 'alike', 'know', 'clueless', 'dense', 'real', 'world', 'actually', 'work', 'go', 'college', 'unlike', 'anna', 'elsa', 'talk', 'reality', 'check', 'princess', 'usually', 'privileged', 'daughter', 'king', 'queen', 'woman', 'marry', 'prince', 'either', 'way', 'look', 'female', 'population', 'naturally', 'fit', 'make', 'bad', 'thing', 'fairy', 'tale', 'simpleton', 'know', 'hell', 'people', 'sex', 'love', 'live', 'together', 'year', 'still', 'look', 'wonder', 'want', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'person', 'let', 'get', 'cynical', 'old', 'school', 'princess', 'story', 'enjoy']","[398, 519, 185, 1, 58, 52, 697, 1534, 62, 6, 477, 1, 426, 172, 30, 13, 226, 11, 290, 2, 679, 11, 25, 50, 1825, 50, 58, 2787, 152, 97, 149, 203, 485, 48, 422, 430, 430, 138, 7, 294, 13, 769, 168, 186, 6, 44, 82, 169, 12, 263, 1760, 2284, 1528, 19, 895, 44, 4, 35, 19, 895, 148, 392, 2257, 13, 720, 545, 264, 1, 246, 2817, 6, 36, 675, 29, 12, 6, 36, 675, 277, 46, 37, 219, 114, 308, 14, 220, 12, 180, 55, 667, 9, 251, 127, 79, 3486, 854, 180, 113, 50, 358, 1, 7, 19, 305, 4, 50, 111, 7, 24, 62, 6, 109, 1, 37, 477, 218, 13, 19, 44, 7, 372, 111, 7, 517, 52, 13, 14, 44, 104, 82, 235, 103, 65, 148, 1599, 44, 62, 1896, 172, 55, 2284, 952, 77, 158, 7, 87, 286, 7, 4, 3108, 1837, 776, 107, 7, 111, 138, 284, 1255, 1277, 1046, 4, 3116, 111, 33, 3653, 287, 2284, 6, 7, 635, 4, 208, 372, 67, 6, 122, 276, 29, 1, 9, 39, 365, 1721, 1573, 1090, 149, 99, 62, 6, 372, 496, 340, 405, 14, 31, 125, 277, 49, 1902, 1828, 35, 50, 340, 405, 62, 6, 372, 41, 109, 14, 125, 13, 74, 23, 1, 29, 1011, 405, 50, 405, 1245, 372, 361, 1, 136, 31, 196, 186, 6, 36, 675, 62, 6, 372, 111, 138, 196, 239, 1, 137, 720, 62, 6, 72, 148, 392, 487, 683, 82, 235, 22, 65, 148, 261, 153, 72, 208, 76, 2774, 20, 148, 425, 640, 1, 473, 859, 3680, 19, 895, 487, 1574, 304, 195, 79, 228, 927, 28, 2963, 548, 6, 251, 459, 725, 56, 3310, 195, 126, 103, 107, 13, 2888, 766, 7, 4, 178, 940, 1310, 29, 460, 4171, 389, 97, 49, 251, 390, 82, 353, 50, 66, 237, 4921, 1102, 560, 14, 65, 43, 219, 114, 56, 778, 46, 3697, 6, 224, 332, 47, 68, 66, 532, 59, 1031, 303, 79, 441, 30, 19, 2095, 64, 923, 29, 12, 91]"

I would have to live secluded from the rest of mankind, end up socially mangled for life and automatically feel anger towards anyone who didn't get me. I couldn't even use them to do good for crying out loud. If fear is your greatest enemy, meet it head on and control it. How come Disney decided to look the other way.If you are more then 10 years of age, do not go see this movie. What am I saying, don't let your kids see this story, it will mess with their morals and bore them on top. I did not get how women over 25 liked this flick in the theater.

Her speaking voice was almost acceptable, but singing-wise, it didn't suit Elsa at all. It's not okay to fall in love after one day, but two is okay?  Elsa was extremely one-dimensional. Despite being the most interesting character, she is deprived of screen time and development. The story was overly simplistic - not at all deep and multi-tiered like Wreck-it Ralph. The Hans twist was underwhelming and unnecessary. The story lacked a good villain. It was also rather predictable. Too much of the movie is spent road-tripping to Elsa's ice castle in a rather trite manner. The most interesting parts seemed rushed, especially the ending, which was anticlimactic and unsatisfying. Anna was the same character the entire movie except for her realization of love's definition, which she had always embodied. Everything she did in the movie was out of love. She shouldn't've been susceptible to being frozen, because metaphorically, it makes no sense. Elsa was the one with the frozen heart. I half-expected Anna to have summer powers or something. Elsa had the world at her fingertips, and created an entire ice castle out of nothing, and yet she struggles to stay alive against dudes with wooden crossbows and her own falling chandelier. Impenetrable ice cage, done. Also, you'd think being alone in that castle with nothing else to do, she'd've learned to control her powers better. The trolls had no recollection of Anna. Neither did Olaf. The visuals were a little cold and lifeless and too computer-y; not nearly as breathtaking as Tangled's lush, painterly animations and sceneries. It feels like a lot more work went into Tangled, whereas Frozen was merely a mini-story. The movie as a whole didn't feel as fully fleshed-out as Tangled in terms of characters and plot, despite being the same length. It would've been much more satisfying if it were given an extra 20-30 minutes. ""It's easier to change your head than your heart."" First of all, I dislike the false dichotomy between head and heart; they're one and the same, and it's nonsensical correlate them to the actual physical components. If the head is taken to mean reason, and the heart means emotion, then the latter should be more volatile.Overall, it's a fun trip with great songs and likable characters; I only wish they had spent more time weaving the story, capitalized on their strengths, and not missed some great opportunities.","['idina', 'menzel', 'miscast', 'speak', 'voice', 'almost', 'acceptable', 'sing', 'wise', 'suit', 'elsa', 'okay', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'day', 'two', 'okay', 'elsa', 'extremely', 'one', 'dimensional', 'despite', 'interest', 'character', 'deprive', 'screen', 'time', 'development', 'story', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'deep', 'multi', 'tiered', 'like', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'han', 'twist', 'underwhelming', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'lack', 'good', 'villain', 'also', 'rather', 'predictable', 'much', 'movie', 'spent', 'road', 'trip', 'elsa', 'ice', 'castle', 'rather', 'trite', 'manner', 'interest', 'part', 'seem', 'rush', 'especially', 'end', 'anticlimactic', 'unsatisfying', 'anna', 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'except', 'realization', 'love', 'definition', 'always', 'embody', 'everything', 'movie', 'love', 'susceptible', 'frozen', 'metaphorically', 'make', 'sense', 'elsa', 'one', 'frozen', 'heart', 'half', 'expect', 'anna', 'summer', 'power', 'something', 'elsa', 'world', 'fingertip', 'create', 'entire', 'ice', 'castle', 'nothing', 'yet', 'struggle', 'stay', 'alive', 'dude', 'wooden', 'crossbow', 'fall', 'chandelier', 'impenetrable', 'ice', 'cage', 'also', 'think', 'alone', 'castle', 'nothing', 'else', 'learn', 'control', 'power', 'well', 'troll', 'recollection', 'anna', 'neither', 'olaf', 'visuals', 'little', 'cold', 'lifeless', 'computer', 'nearly', 'breathtaking', 'tangle', 'lush', 'painterly', 'animation', 'scenery', 'feel', 'like', 'lot', 'work', 'go', 'tangle', 'whereas', 'frozen', 'merely', 'mini', 'story', 'movie', 'whole', 'feel', 'fully', 'flesh', 'tangle', 'term', 'character', 'plot', 'despite', 'length', 'would', 'much', 'satisfy', 'give', 'extra', 'minute', 'easy', 'change', 'head', 'heart', 'first', 'dislike', 'false', 'dichotomy', 'head', 'heart', 'one', 'nonsensical', 'correlate', 'actual', 'physical', 'component', 'head', 'take', 'mean', 'reason', 'heart', 'mean', 'emotion', 'latter', 'volatile', 'overall', 'fun', 'trip', 'great', 'song', 'likable', 'character', 'wish', 'spent', 'time', 'weave', 'story', 'capitalize', 'strength', 'miss', 'great', 'opportunity']","[141, 116, 4113, 641, 86, 173, 2341, 63, 1041, 1355, 4, 420, 186, 6, 10, 138, 42, 420, 4, 423, 10, 751, 313, 122, 8, 3834, 369, 20, 356, 12, 1200, 1556, 574, 1590, 9, 352, 379, 44, 129, 3278, 845, 12, 273, 17, 104, 27, 191, 331, 31, 1, 992, 1734, 1066, 4, 33, 168, 191, 2144, 1377, 122, 94, 75, 525, 121, 41, 3900, 7, 8, 264, 1, 474, 3471, 6, 1585, 163, 4795, 132, 1, 6, 5, 4727, 14, 217, 4, 10, 5, 80, 346, 131, 7, 205, 24, 89, 4, 126, 3577, 134, 264, 33, 168, 156, 182, 639, 510, 1301, 1578, 2894, 4940, 186, 33, 27, 37, 344, 168, 156, 270, 347, 128, 24, 18, 123, 7, 1197, 32, 267, 48, 366, 4941, 642, 501, 905, 83, 1834, 21, 1217, 53, 9, 84, 107, 13, 83, 1565, 5, 1300, 2707, 12, 1, 127, 53, 822, 1620, 83, 657, 8, 52, 313, 1465, 26, 31, 1188, 57, 1237, 211, 454, 209, 317, 80, 36, 1116, 1950, 3901, 317, 80, 10, 2127, 3902, 815, 1873, 2547, 317, 55, 218, 180, 80, 218, 240, 955, 4942, 166, 125, 1066, 25, 11, 402, 8, 417, 992, 20, 3440, 12, 2934, 887, 271, 25, 759]"
753,3,"Strong female leads are nowadays more desirable than they ever have been. Frozen capitalizes on this as strongly as possible, but fails at almost every turn. Their attempt at showing a more platonic love story is misguided and blunt with it's delivery. The story is full of plot holes and strange plot devices that make little to no sense within the context. The relationships feel forced and the message of the movie feels completely benign. Albeit, I am writing this from a 22 year old male's perspective, but having grown up with Disney movies and after the sheer gold that was Tangled, I have certain standards. Instead of going on a long winded explanation as to my complaints with this movie, I'm going to summarize in a numbered list instead. Here are the 6 biggest problems with Frozen. 6. Elsa is boring. Aside from the brief moment with her as a child, we only see one emotion from Elsa for the entire film, worry. Her character is completely one dimensional and frankly, really disappointing. After seeing her smiling face on everything from cups to buses to billboards, I expected her to be some sort of revolutionary new character, the Ice Queen! But no. Not really no.5: It tries and fails to replicate the chemistry between Flynn and Rapunzel with Kristoff and Anna. My favorite exchange between the two was whilst they were under attack by the wolves and hearing the sheer disbelief in Kristoff's voice, but it all goes downhill from there.4. The songs are lazy. Let it Go feels as if the sequence was made before the rest of the movie was even written and then had to be fit in somehow. The song itself is very nice, but nowhere near what the hype train had me believe. The lyrics to Fixer Upper are horrible, but I'll be getting to that later. The rest are just forgettable really. 3. Olaf. Granted he did add an edge of humor back to this dull story, I couldn't shake the comparison to another horrible side character made for comedic purposes; Jar Jar Binks. Both suffer from having the entirety of the movie's humor lumped on them like some unwanted burden and both have a bad habit of completely derailing the immersion of the story and snapping the viewer back into a state of disbelief at their very existence. (Also, it was never explained how he came to life. That in itself was annoying.)2. The Trolls. My reaction to these annoying, strange, out of place little creatures could be summed up in one common acronym, wtf. Unexplained, unnecessary, undesirable and just plain unintelligent in both sound and design. They are apparently love experts? The 'Fixer Upper' song was horrifyingly bad and essentially tried to bypass the chemistry of Kristoff and Anna's relationship with one big push. They simply didn't fit the world, there was no explanation as to why Kristoff was friends with them OR how the elder somehow knew how to help Anna, they were just tiny, terrible plot devices.1. The message/revelation. Surprise! Platonic love is a kind of love! Did the movie REALLY need to be so heavy handed about this? Elsa was protecting Anna the entire movie because she loved her, so this apparent epiphany shouldn't have even been a thing. Sure, little girls everywhere apparently learned a lesson, but it was such an underwhelming resolution to the film that I was left walking away with that feeling. Overall, I can see the power this might have for young girls, but that is all the power it has. Kristoff's character was underdeveloped and Hans' (despite his decent motive) was a strange plot twist, but far from the worst thing in the movie. I would recommend this only for the most die hard of Disney fans or those particularly fond of sister-centric plots. For a real example of a good modern Disney film, see Tangled.","['strong', 'female', 'lead', 'nowadays', 'desirable', 'ever', 'frozen', 'capitalizes', 'strongly', 'possible', 'fails', 'almost', 'every', 'turn', 'attempt', 'show', 'platonic', 'love', 'story', 'misguide', 'blunt', 'delivery', 'story', 'full', 'plot', 'hole', 'strange', 'plot', 'device', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'within', 'context', 'relationship', 'feel', 'force', 'message', 'movie', 'feel', 'completely', 'benign', 'albeit', 'write', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'perspective', 'grown', 'disney', 'movie', 'sheer', 'gold', 'tangle', 'certain', 'standard', 'instead', 'go', 'long', 'wind', 'explanation', 'complaint', 'movie', 'go', 'summarize', 'numbered', 'list', 'instead', 'big', 'problem', 'frozen', 'elsa', 'boring', 'aside', 'brief', 'moment', 'child', 'see', 'one', 'emotion', 'elsa', 'entire', 'film', 'worry', 'character', 'completely', 'one', 'dimensional', 'frankly', 'really', 'disappoint', 'see', 'smile', 'face', 'everything', 'cup', 'bus', 'billboard', 'expect', 'sort', 'revolutionary', 'new', 'character', 'ice', 'queen', 'really', 'try', 'fails', 'replicate', 'chemistry', 'flynn', 'rapunzel', 'kristoff', 'anna', 'favorite', 'exchange', 'two', 'whilst', 'attack', 'wolf', 'hearing', 'sheer', 'disbelief', 'kristoff', 'voice', 'go', 'downhill', 'song', 'lazy', 'let', 'go', 'feel', 'sequence', 'make', 'rest', 'movie', 'even', 'write', 'fit', 'somehow', 'song', 'nice', 'nowhere', 'near', 'hype', 'train', 'believe', 'lyric', 'fixer', 'upper', 'horrible', 'get', 'later', 'rest', 'forgettable', 'really', 'olaf', 'grant', 'add', 'edge', 'humor', 'back', 'dull', 'story', 'shake', 'comparison', 'another', 'horrible', 'side', 'character', 'make', 'comedic', 'purpose', 'jar', 'jar', 'binks', 'suffer', 'entirety', 'movie', 'humor', 'lump', 'like', 'unwanted', 'burden', 'bad', 'habit', 'completely', 'derail', 'immersion', 'story', 'snap', 'viewer', 'back', 'state', 'disbelief', 'existence', 'also', 'never', 'explain', 'come', 'life', 'annoy', 'troll', 'reaction', 'annoy', 'strange', 'place', 'little', 'creature', 'could', 'sum', 'one', 'common', 'acronym', 'wtf', 'unexplained', 'unnecessary', 'undesirable', 'plain', 'unintelligent', 'sound', 'design', 'apparently', 'love', 'expert', 'fixer', 'upper', 'song', 'horrifyingly', 'bad', 'essentially', 'try', 'bypass', 'chemistry', 'kristoff', 'anna', 'relationship', 'one', 'big', 'push', 'simply', 'fit', 'world', 'explanation', 'kristoff', 'friend', 'elder', 'somehow', 'knew', 'help', 'anna', 'tiny', 'terrible', 'plot', 'device', 'message', 'revelation', 'surprise', 'platonic', 'love', 'kind', 'love', 'movie', 'really', 'need', 'heavy', 'hand', 'elsa', 'protect', 'anna', 'entire', 'movie', 'love', 'apparent', 'epiphany', 'even', 'thing', 'sure', 'little', 'girl', 'everywhere', 'apparently', 'learn', 'lesson', 'underwhelming', 'resolution', 'film', 'left', 'walk', 'away', 'feel', 'overall', 'see', 'power', 'might', 'young', 'girl', 'power', 'kristoff', 'character', 'underdeveloped', 'han', 'despite', 'decent', 'motive', 'strange', 'plot', 'twist', 'far', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'die', 'hard', 'disney', 'fan', 'particularly', 'fond', 'sister', 'centric', 'plot', 'real', 'example', 'good', 'modern', 'disney', 'film', 'see', 'tangle']","[167, 237, 248, 1475, 2893, 81, 5, 1456, 673, 1052, 173, 115, 113, 448, 78, 4943, 6, 12, 3417, 3522, 2756, 12, 246, 52, 697, 980, 52, 2537, 14, 48, 217, 654, 1470, 153, 53, 272, 185, 1, 53, 291, 2277, 165, 47, 64, 431, 1141, 1107, 2, 1, 2007, 1920, 83, 563, 633, 208, 13, 169, 848, 806, 897, 1, 13, 4904, 550, 208, 106, 198, 5, 4, 370, 716, 1661, 133, 70, 16, 10, 240, 4, 264, 3, 1177, 8, 291, 10, 751, 1547, 22, 808, 16, 914, 381, 132, 2785, 4944, 3812, 131, 539, 2494, 108, 8, 33, 49, 22, 87, 1052, 2577, 1005, 1322, 527, 67, 7, 189, 2461, 42, 1130, 1931, 2002, 995, 2007, 2672, 67, 86, 13, 3003, 11, 1373, 30, 13, 53, 502, 14, 303, 1, 28, 165, 560, 981, 11, 192, 801, 449, 406, 1124, 220, 475, 772, 737, 896, 19, 358, 303, 660, 22, 32, 1865, 269, 1068, 222, 74, 1026, 12, 2591, 1126, 102, 896, 387, 8, 14, 1043, 646, 1007, 1007, 1887, 888, 3835, 1, 222, 9, 4631, 3068, 65, 3136, 291, 12, 4945, 479, 74, 881, 2672, 1429, 27, 88, 400, 40, 79, 238, 123, 1653, 238, 980, 188, 48, 1334, 54, 1404, 10, 999, 3380, 1401, 845, 4935, 915, 259, 424, 755, 6, 1818, 772, 737, 11, 65, 1668, 87, 1005, 67, 7, 153, 10, 106, 809, 341, 560, 126, 806, 67, 327, 1139, 981, 488, 135, 7, 1936, 432, 52, 2537, 185, 1833, 445, 4943, 6, 193, 6, 1, 22, 99, 1376, 323, 4, 513, 7, 264, 1, 6, 1817, 28, 43, 207, 48, 76, 879, 755, 347, 499, 3278, 1098, 3, 330, 669, 101, 53, 166, 16, 24, 252, 73, 76, 24, 67, 8, 2089, 44, 313, 546, 3252, 980, 52, 129, 142, 65, 43, 1, 26, 262, 368, 307, 2, 176, 536, 2807, 15, 3414, 52, 195, 396, 17, 324, 2, 3, 16, 83]"
754,1,"These people giving it a 10/10 and calling it ""The Best Disney Movie Ever"" have clearly never seen older Disney movies. If they had, they would know that this movie pales in comparison to the majority of Disney's animated movies. This whole movie has become so overrated that it has become a sort of cult. It is quite surprising that such a dull movie has managed to accomplish such a feat. That being said, before you label me as someone who gave a low rating because they're ""too old for Disney"", I'd like to say that I still enjoyed many of the recent Disney films, like The Princess and The Frog, Tangled and Wreck-It-Ralph. If you're a true Disney fan, you will find that this movie cannot hold a candle to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Mulan, Cinderella, Pocahontas, Sleeping Beauty, or Snow White. Similarly, the more recent movies, like The Princess and The Frog and Tangled, were both much more enjoyable than Frozen.It saddens me to see Disney release such a low-quality movie. Don't get me wrong; the animation was great, but nowhere near as breathtaking as that of Tangled or Brave. Then, beneath the pretty animation, there is absolutely no substance. The plot was very poorly thought out and even contradictory at times. One of my biggest issues with the plot was that a problem that had been building up since the beginning of the movie was solved in less than two minutes and the audience went from feeling overly anxious to relieved, but very confused. The resolution was so weak and anti-climatic that I was left to wonder, if the problem was so easily solved, why did the characters waste 15+ years trying to solve it and, more importantly, why did I just waste 2 hours watching this?All of the songs- yes, this includes Let It Go- are sub-par; some are even downright atrocious. Furthermore, the voice acting could definitely have been better. Disney movies are typically made to appeal to people of all ages, not exclusively to kids. However, this movie broke the tradition. The jokes are very straightforward and clearly directed at very young children (as if they would not be able to understand any other type of humor). To give you a taste of the humor in Frozen, one of the jokes made by Olaf the snowman (the comic relief character) was, ""I don't have a skullor bones"". I really fail to see the humor in such insipid ""jokes"". The sidekicks in the movie are very annoying, especially the trolls and Olaf. Even the main characters, like Anna, Kristoff, and Elsa, got on my nerves at times. Anna is too awkward to be remotely relatable or realistic, Kristoff seems more like a woman- stealer than anything else, and Elsa is very selfish at times. Sven is probably my favorite character in the entire movie since he's the only one who doesn't talk.Anyways, if you're looking for the depth and complexity that old Disney movies possess, you should probably look elsewhere as you will be very disappointed in this movie. However, if you're just looking for a lifeless, glitzy animation to pass the time, then by all means, go watch it. Growing up in the era of the Disney Renaissance, I belong to the first group of people, so I rate this movie a 1/10. Sure, good animation is nice but I didn't buy a movie ticket to just stare at graphics. Lovable characters, memorable music, and an interesting plot are what usually set Disney movies apart from others, and Frozen just didn't satisfy any of those requirements. This movie was very disappointing, to say the least.","['people', 'give', 'call', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'clearly', 'never', 'see', 'old', 'disney', 'movie', 'would', 'know', 'movie', 'pale', 'comparison', 'majority', 'disney', 'animate', 'movie', 'whole', 'movie', 'become', 'overrate', 'become', 'sort', 'cult', 'quite', 'surprising', 'dull', 'movie', 'manage', 'accomplish', 'feat', 'say', 'label', 'someone', 'give', 'low', 'rating', 'old', 'disney', 'like', 'say', 'still', 'enjoy', 'many', 'recent', 'disney', 'film', 'like', 'princess', 'frog', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'true', 'disney', 'fan', 'find', 'movie', 'hold', 'candle', 'beauty', 'beast', 'aladdin', 'little', 'mermaid', 'mulan', 'cinderella', 'pocahontas', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'snow', 'white', 'similarly', 'recent', 'movie', 'like', 'princess', 'frog', 'tangle', 'much', 'enjoyable', 'frozen', 'saddens', 'see', 'disney', 'release', 'low', 'quality', 'movie', 'get', 'wrong', 'animation', 'great', 'nowhere', 'near', 'breathtaking', 'tangle', 'brave', 'beneath', 'pretty', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'substance', 'plot', 'poorly', 'thought', 'even', 'contradictory', 'time', 'one', 'big', 'issue', 'plot', 'problem', 'building', 'since', 'begin', 'movie', 'solve', 'less', 'two', 'minute', 'audience', 'go', 'feel', 'overly', 'anxious', 'relieve', 'confuse', 'resolution', 'weak', 'anti', 'climatic', 'left', 'wonder', 'problem', 'easily', 'solve', 'character', 'waste', 'year', 'try', 'solve', 'importantly', 'waste', 'hour', 'watch', 'song', 'yes', 'include', 'let', 'go', 'sub', 'par', 'even', 'downright', 'atrocious', 'furthermore', 'voice', 'act', 'could', 'definitely', 'well', 'disney', 'movie', 'typically', 'make', 'appeal', 'people', 'age', 'exclusively', 'kid', 'however', 'movie', 'broke', 'tradition', 'joke', 'straightforward', 'clearly', 'direct', 'young', 'child', 'would', 'able', 'understand', 'type', 'humor', 'give', 'taste', 'humor', 'frozen', 'one', 'joke', 'make', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'skull', 'bone', 'really', 'fail', 'see', 'humor', 'insipid', 'joke', 'sidekick', 'movie', 'annoy', 'especially', 'troll', 'olaf', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'like', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'elsa', 'get', 'nerve', 'time', 'anna', 'awkward', 'remotely', 'relatable', 'realistic', 'kristoff', 'seem', 'like', 'woman', 'stealer', 'anything', 'else', 'elsa', 'selfish', 'time', 'sven', 'probably', 'favorite', 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'since', 'one', 'talk', 'anyways', 'look', 'depth', 'complexity', 'old', 'disney', 'movie', 'posse', 'probably', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'however', 'look', 'lifeless', 'glitzy', 'animation', 'pas', 'time', 'mean', 'go', 'watch', 'grow', 'era', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'belong', 'first', 'group', 'people', 'rate', 'movie', 'sure', 'good', 'animation', 'nice', 'buy', 'movie', 'ticket', 'stare', 'graphic', 'lovable', 'character', 'memorable', 'music', 'interest', 'plot', 'usually', 'set', 'disney', 'movie', 'apart', 'others', 'frozen', 'satisfy', 'requirement', 'movie', 'disappoint', 'say', 'least']","[46, 57, 308, 34, 2, 1, 81, 690, 88, 16, 64, 2, 1, 26, 56, 1, 2616, 1126, 1163, 2, 38, 1, 127, 1, 179, 426, 179, 539, 3208, 124, 1029, 1026, 1, 857, 2883, 2307, 35, 2233, 304, 57, 1023, 437, 64, 2, 9, 35, 68, 91, 61, 399, 2, 3, 9, 29, 659, 83, 352, 379, 62, 2, 176, 71, 1, 655, 3185, 149, 203, 485, 48, 422, 931, 854, 1646, 1090, 149, 39, 365, 2348, 399, 1, 9, 29, 659, 83, 31, 306, 5, 4946, 16, 2, 288, 1023, 283, 1, 19, 280, 21, 25, 801, 449, 905, 83, 335, 3489, 136, 21, 292, 1722, 52, 1125, 92, 28, 4470, 20, 10, 106, 519, 52, 198, 920, 98, 160, 1, 1684, 321, 42, 211, 159, 13, 53, 1200, 3903, 2430, 875, 1098, 434, 1273, 4902, 330, 532, 198, 403, 1684, 8, 644, 47, 87, 1684, 1398, 644, 487, 23, 11, 325, 349, 30, 13, 2043, 1028, 28, 1830, 3904, 2137, 86, 112, 54, 174, 18, 2, 1, 1782, 14, 484, 46, 139, 4095, 60, 110, 1, 1802, 1071, 451, 1806, 690, 721, 73, 70, 26, 294, 216, 524, 222, 57, 1120, 222, 5, 10, 451, 14, 32, 45, 309, 297, 8, 3311, 2614, 22, 1166, 16, 222, 2404, 451, 436, 1, 238, 121, 123, 32, 28, 119, 8, 9, 7, 67, 4, 19, 2432, 20, 7, 810, 2331, 884, 640, 67, 75, 9, 251, 2409, 212, 270, 4, 1558, 20, 181, 210, 189, 8, 264, 1, 98, 10, 178, 1292, 66, 609, 1797, 64, 2, 1, 1215, 210, 66, 4947, 476, 1, 110, 66, 4941, 4913, 21, 1204, 20, 218, 13, 23, 285, 942, 2, 465, 2784, 36, 849, 46, 694, 1, 207, 17, 21, 192, 948, 1, 2070, 714, 726, 8, 268, 58, 122, 52, 460, 144, 2, 1, 512, 247, 5, 1188, 2451, 1, 808, 35, 250]"
755,1,"Visually, Frozen is perfect. Absolutely perfect. One of the most stunning works of animation I've ever seen. The equal of Disney's best.From the settings to the character animation, it simply couldn't be better, and many scenes in the film could never have been captured with even the finest 2D animation as effectively as they were in CGI.The Norwegian influences were wonderful and greatly deepened the story, creating a rich and convincing and believable, organic world that was fascinating in its touches of folklore and historicity.Having said that, the movie is at times a bit frustrating, due to its many missed opportunities.In creating Elsa, Disney devised the most complex and unique princess in its history. As a character, she is the most conflicted and fascinating since Prince Adam (the Beast), in Beauty and the Beast. And no princess has ever suffered as much as Elsa does. She may not have been physically cursed, as was the Beast, but her life is every bit as tortured and isolated; indeed, more so, because the Beast only hurts himself, but Elsa has to live knowing that she once hurt her own sister.It was a huge missed opportunity on the part of Frozen not to give Elsa a love story. Nothing in the world could have been more beautiful than if this character, who spends a lifetime (not to mention most of the movie) utterly alone, would have finally found romantic love. It could have been ""the most beautiful love story ever told,"" if a prince had finally begun to see past her dangerous side, helped her realize her goodness of heart, and shown her the romantic love that she's been denied her whole life (which, at the age of 21, would be an aching longing for her indeed).Not every princess needs a prince, of course. Many princesses are fine without them, and frankly, I don't see why Anna needed not just one but two romances, where her sister got none. Anna's storyline could have sufficed in learning that love at first sight isn't always true. She hardly needed to experience yet another, ""successful"" romance the very next day, which practically undercut the first message (one day is too short to love someone, but two days is okay?).But Elsa's case is unique. In her case, it would have been so beautiful to have seen her find romantic love, because of how tragically isolated she has been her whole life.And the sister story wouldn't have suffered, because after all, Anna has her two romances AND achieves sisterly reconciliation as well, so Elsa could have experienced both forms of love too; indeed, in Elsa's case, it would have been much more meaningful, because she's been deprived of love her whole life and never thought that she could ever have a husband and family, due to her ice magic.Apart from that, the film missed another opportunity by showing us so little of Elsa's heart. Much more of the film could have taken place inside the ice palace, where Elsa could have disclosed her heart to a sidekick of some kind, either serious or comical or both – and better still, a sidekick that SHE HERSELF COULD HAVE CREATED. That has never before been done in a Disney movie, a princess creating her own sidekick, and Elsa's interactions with her sidekick or sidekicks could have been as moving and memorable as the Beast's interactions with his cursed household, which are some of the most powerful scenes in Beauty and the Beast.More scenes of Elsa as an ""artist of ice and snow"" would have been beautiful as well, and more of her ice-magic casting would have been thrilling to see. And the scenes that do appear, such as her ""Don't feel. Don't feel"" scene, when her ice palace turns red, could have been turned into a second song.Those are just some of the film's missed opportunities, all having to do with not capitalizing on the film's most exciting character.Don't get me wrong. I love what the film does show us. Even with the scenes we do see, Elsa is amazing, and as I said, Disney's finest character, ever. I just wish that there had been more of her. The road-trip side of the story, which takes up so much of the running time, just doesn't seem as interesting. It's been done before, and frankly better, with better action and characters.But as I said, I think the animation is top-notch, and the performances that the animators gave to the characters, especially Elsa, are incredibly convincing. You believe in every emotion that's on screen, and nothing seems fake or cartoonish, except for the questionable twist ending.Frozen is wonderful as it is, and along with Tangled, is one of Disney's two best films since The Lion King. But with just a different emphasis on the most interesting characters and an even more joyous ending, with Elsa more richly rewarded for all the suffering that she goes through, it could have been even greater.","['visually', 'frozen', 'perfect', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'one', 'stun', 'work', 'animation', 'ever', 'see', 'equal', 'disney', 'best', 'setting', 'character', 'animation', 'simply',

Sadly, I have missed it when it went out in cinemas.Compared to other Disney movies, especially the recent ones like Rapuntzel and Princess and the Frog, Frozen comes out as a disappointment. I would go as far as say that the message this film passes to children is actually bad.Elsa, for example, takes only one decision by herself and that is to run away from all of her problems. She completely disregards the fact that she put every other living being in the kingdom in danger. She only snaps out of it when she discovers the proverbial 'force of love' by act of providence.Anna, on the other hand, makes a series of very bad decisions and survives only by a miracle. (e.g.: walking out in blizzard in summer clothes or leaving the whole kingdom in hands of a stranger she just met).Songs are extremely repetitive with one exception of 'Let it go'.I really hope the next Disney classic will be a more enjoyable experience.","['watch', 'frozen', 'hype', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'sadly', 'miss', 'go', 'cinema', 'compare', 'disney', 'movie', 'especially', 'recent', 'one', 'like', 'rapuntzel', 'princess', 'frog', 'frozen', 'come', 'disappointment', 'would', 'go', 'far', 'say', 'message', 'film', 'pass', 'child', 'actually', 'bad', 'elsa', 'example', 'take', 'one', 'decision', 'run', 'away', 'problem', 'completely', 'disregard', 'fact', 'put', 'every', 'living', 'kingdom', 'danger', 'snap', 'discovers', 'proverbial', 'force', 'love', 'act', 'providence', 'anna', 'hand', 'make', 'series', 'bad', 'decision', 'survives', 'miracle', 'e', 'g', 'walk', 'blizzard', 'summer', 'clothes', 'leave', 'whole', 'kingdom', 'hand', 'stranger', 'met', 'song', 'extremely', 'repetitive', 'one', 'exception', 'let', 'go', 'really', 'hope', 'next', 'disney', 'classic', 'enjoyable', 'experience']","[23, 5, 406, 26, 210, 306, 334, 1670, 271, 13, 543, 350, 2, 1, 121, 399, 10, 9, 4951, 29, 659, 5, 40, 1038, 26, 13, 142, 35, 185, 3, 1122, 70, 103, 65, 4, 396, 55, 10, 758, 233, 101, 198, 291, 4952, 201, 196, 115, 704, 77, 901, 4945, 1859, 4953, 272, 6, 112, 7, 323, 14, 791, 65, 758, 4523, 2183, 893, 1986, 669, 1508, 205, 3234, 322, 127, 77, 323, 1249, 392, 11, 423, 1982, 10, 645, 30, 13, 22, 384, 418, 2, 69, 306, 334]"
757,1,"I have said before, it is difficult to get a good review from Me, sometimes I give movies the benefit of the doubt, but not in this case. Frozen is arguable one of Disney's poorest films, from the laziness with animation, to the awful songs. I feel that the trailer is better than the actual film, and I don't see what the hype is. First of all, the beginning of the film is weak and hardly tells You anything about what You are watching, I mean a song about Ice? Besides this the story is entirely to rushed, and can be confusing at parts because the story is moving so fast without a pause. Now, let Me say something about this soundtrack....Just No....Most of the songs in the movie were pointless, came in randomly, had little to no thought or story, and didn't make Me feel anything but annoyance (Yes, I even thought Let it go was a bad song) Moving on to the Characters, all I can say is what was Disney thinking?! The characters in this movie are way to goofy and hokey for my liking, they don't even act like real people! They are simply nothing more than one-dimensional, cookie cutter, forgettable, and complete disgraces. Half of the characters are not needed in the movie and their roles could have been so much better! None of the characters had a strong personality or something about them that just stuck, they are nothing to rave about, they were all just flat to Me. Despite all of these things the worst part is there was no emotion! There was nothing real about this movie! It's just a pathetic excuse for an entertaining family film, the other thing is the villain is just sorry!

758,9,"With the best animated film of 2013 claim, that's saying a lot as it has been a very hit and miss year for animation(have yet to see The Wind Rises though, not playing in my country), there are some very good ones(Despicable Me 2, Monsters University, Dark Knight Returns Part 2), but a fair few lacklustre ones(Justin and the Knights of Valour, Planes, Escape from Planet Earth) and some bad ones(Sir Billi, My Little Pony: Equestria Girls, Free Birds). Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs falls into decent category. Disney did fall into hit-and-miss-land after Tarzan but Princess and the Frog saw them in terms of feature films back on form and Tangled and Wreck It Ralph were even better, Winnie the Pooh was very cute too. Frozen for me was outstanding, not perfect maybe but one of Disney's best since The Hunchback of Notre Dame at any rate and with some of the contemporary wit as well as the feel of hearkening back to the Renaissance another example of Disney being back on form.It did feel ever so slightly rushed at times like the ending, the trolls' song was out of place and not as catchy or as memorable as the rest of the songs- more like filler than anything else and while the twist was very surprising and unexpected chunks of the writing at that point sounded a bit clichéd. In terms of problems(which are personal taste rather than objective) though those are pretty much it and with everything else so beautifully done they don't seem that major. The best component was the animation which was spellbinding, if there was a pick of the most visually beautiful film from Disney since Tarzan that pick would be Frozen. The setting stands out among the rest of those in a Disney film like Princess and the Frog did with New Orleans and will positively give you chills just looking at it. The colours are very rich and beautifully textured with the shadings not too bright or too over-saturated. The characters are well modelled and defined particularly Elsa, and the detail and fluidity in the backgrounds is to be admired.The music has a fantasy sparkle yet a rousing adventure sound to it, not only appropriate and dynamic for the tones and setting of the film but also appealing on the ears and memorable. The songs range from upbeat and lovely, the highlight of the score is Let It Go, one of the most emotional and heartfelt songs possibly in the Disney canon, no Disney song since God Help the Outcasts affected me as much. For the First Time in Forever and the touching Do You Want to Build a Snowman(the song that moves the story forward the most and says about the sisters' relationship) also deserve a mention, and actually the show-tune-like style may suggest a stage show in the near future. The writing is pitched perfectly, the dramatic moments are genuinely touching like in the first 10 minutes and the humorous moments very sharply written and smart, Olaf is a joy and the chemistry between Anna and Kristoff show some sparkling interplay. The story may lack the polish of Tangled but it is still easy to follow and full of humour to entertain kids and adults, drama that is gripping and identifiable and thrilling spectacle(like Elsa building her glacial fortress of solitude).As for the characters they carry the story wonderfully, they avoid being clichéd- Elsa especially, the trailer made her look like an evil snow queen but she is much more human than that, more a co-protagonist and heroine which adds to the emotional power of the story- and actually consist of the heroes having flaws instead of being too perfect and the villain not seeming like one initially. Olaf is cute and hilarious, and the reindeer Sven is likewise appealing for the same reasons. I didn't mind the trolls personally, they were like the Gargoyles from Hunchback of Notre Dame that I didn't mind them as characters but wasn't crazy about their song. The voice acting is terrific, especially from Idina Menzel who is highly emotive and involving, Kristen Bell who's very spirited and sings like an angel and Josh Gad who sounded like he was having a ball as Olaf. Overall, outstanding effort from Disney, not one of their absolute best but one of their best since the end of the Renaissance and stands out by a mile among the other animated films of 2013. 9/10

759,10,"I never claimed to be an expert in musical theatre but I have seen my fair share of film musicals (including most of the MGM productions from the 40s, and most of the recent Disney work) and a good number of Broadway shows. There is something here that is new and ground-breaking. Here the characters don't merely ""break into song"" -- which is the way most film musicals traditionally work -- but rather they are, for large stretches of the production, already in song and instead ""break into voice."" I am sorry if I am not being clear but, as I said, there is something new here. It reminds me very much of the Broadway productions of the 60s, there is a certain joy, a certain primal desire .. to sing the story (especially at the beginning of the film, less perhaps toward the end). And the animation is the best I have seen. I recall reading some scholarly discussion explaining that Japanese were far ahead of everyone else in animation (manga) because they knew, from the getgo, that facial expressions were the key, everything else was secondary. One suspects that the Disney people have been quietly spending millions on perfecting the facial expressions because these are literally the best I have seen. (Although the work in the TV series LAST AIRBENDER was extraordinary in this regard, given the much smaller budget). The story is magical. The script is wonderful. Kristen Bell, who has been bouncing around in some very strange films lately (my review of Lifeguard, which was not flattering, discussed this) seems to have found her inner Voice Actress and she could I think spend the rest of her career just doing voice, if she wanted. Nice to see of Joss Whedon's favourite actors, Alan Tudyk, also finding his inner animation actor. This is no ordinary Disney release. This is destined to be a classic.","['never', 'claimed', 'expert', 'musical', 'theatre', 'see', 'fair', 'share', 'film', 'musical', 'include', 'mgm', 'production', 'recent', 'disney', 'work', 'good', 'number', 'broadway', 'show', 'something', 'new', 'ground', 'break', 'character', 'merely', 'break', 'song', 'way', 'film', 'musical', 'traditionally', 'work', 'rather', 'large', 'stretch', 'production', 'already', 'song', 'instead', 'break', 'voice', 'sorry', 'clear', 'say', 'something', 'new', 'reminds', 'much', 'broadway', 'production', 'certain', 'joy', 'certain', 'primal', 'desire', 'sing', 'story', 'especially', 'begin', 'film', 'less', 'perhaps', 'toward', 'end', 'animation', 'best', 'see', 'recall', 'reading', 'scholarly', 'discussion', 'explain', 'japanese', 'far', 'ahead', 'everyone', 'else', 'animation', 'manga', 'knew', 'getgo', 'facial', 'expression', 'key', 'everything', 'else', 'secondary', 'one', 'suspect', 'disney', 'people', 'quietly', 'spending', 'million', 'perfect', 'facial', 'expression', 'literally', 'best', 'see', 'although', 'work', 'tv', 'series', 'last', 'airbender', 'extraordinary', 'regard', 'give', 'much', 'small', 'budget', 'story', 'magical', 'script', 'wonderful', 'kristen', 'bell', 'bounce', 'around', 'strange', 'film', 'lately', 'review', 'lifeguard', 'flatter', 'discuss', 'seem', 'found', 'inner', 'voice', 'actress', 'could', 'think', 'spend', 'rest', 'career', 'voice', 'want', 'nice', 'see', 'joss', 'whedon', 'favourite', 'actor', 'alan', 'tudyk', 'also', 'find', 'inner', 'animation', 'actor', 'ordinary', 'disney', 'release', 'destine', 'classic']","[88, 2399, 1818, 51, 1275, 16, 1257, 781, 3, 51, 349, 3794, 700, 399, 2, 107, 17, 184, 411, 78, 89, 108, 1051, 340, 8, 1300, 340, 11, 50, 3, 51, 3285, 107, 191, 977, 2319, 700, 397, 11, 208, 340, 86, 777, 871, 35, 89, 108, 1044, 31, 411, 700, 563, 738, 563, 1070, 63, 12, 121, 160, 3, 321, 578, 1791, 41, 21, 34, 16, 924, 1416, 2831, 400, 2949, 142, 1270, 109, 270, 21, 4517, 488, 1482, 1069, 1165, 132, 270, 1665, 10, 1845, 2, 46, 4962, 1407, 965, 175, 1482, 1069, 643, 34, 16, 255, 107, 1059, 791, 197, 4963, 1582, 902, 57, 31, 601, 1351, 12, 170, 395, 215, 162, 146, 1969, 200, 980, 3, 2067, 161, 3312, 75, 231, 1154, 86, 1495, 54, 37, 1031, 303, 3293, 86, 59, 192, 16, 622, 518, 1134, 1426, 27, 71, 1154, 21, 518, 1420, 2, 288, 2896, 69]"
760,2,"This is most definitely not Disney at its finest. I can take an educated guess and say that people claimed this is a fantastic movie because of the song ""Let it go"". I saw the song ""Let it go"" on Youtube before I saw the actual movie and I was amazed with the animations and the song in general. I connected that to the movie being amazing, but trust me, it is FAR from amazing. The movie begins with Elsa and her sister Anna playing in the castle, with Elsa using her supposedly cursed ice powers. Why exactly is it a curse? Disney neglected to provide an explanation. Elsa hurts Anna and this causes Anna to be taken to some trolls whose cure her. I guess humans wouldn't suffice because of the whole magic-cure scenario. The trolls then tell Elsa that her 'dark' powers will grow and that if Elsa cannot control the powers, she will be a threat to all around her. Elsa's parents (who, by the way, are the most idiotic parents I have ever seen) tell the trolls that Elsa won't harm anyone and then proceed to seclude Elsa from human contact(after wiping out Anna's memory of Elsa's powers).After secluding Elsa from everyone, her parents tell her they are going on a cruise and leaving she and Anna alone inside the castle (they are still quite young) with no other family to take care of them. Not only have Elsa's parents pretty much told Elsa that she is a monster and must be contained, but they abandon her and die. This leads to Elsa isolating herself further and leaving her little sister to cope with the loss of their parents alone.Coronation day! I have no idea who was running the kingdom after her parents died because it has been quite some time before Elsa is old enough to become queen. Perhaps politics was paused while Elsa was growing up. During the party, Anna meets some prince from some random country and they have that 'fall in love at first sight' moment and decide to get married...come on, seriously? Elsa, of course, declines to give her blessing and Anna decides to yell at her in front of everyone. This causes Elsa to become afraid and anxious, leading her to reveal her powers to the town and subsequently running away from her own kingdom after some random foreign guy tells gives the order to capture the queen. What the *bleep*?Elsa runs away, and her sister starts giving orders. Since when can princesses give orders on behalf of the queen? Here is where the song ""Let it go"" is played, and Elsa decides to stop being afraid of herself and makes an ice palace, a supermodel dress, and eternal winter using her powers. When Anna finally reaches the ice palace with Kristoff (a guy who was placed so obviously to be the love interest), Anna confronts Elsa and Elsa decides to become afraid again. Didn't she moments ago in the song decree herself to be fearless and not care what anyone thinks? She unleashes her powers and hurts her sister out of fear.Finally, when Hans (the random foreign guy whom Anna left in charge of Elsa's kingdom, again, what the *bleep*?) arrives to capture Elsa, a fight ensues and Elsa is captured and taken back to her kingdom. Anna, who at this point is near death because of Elsa's attack, is told by Hans he was merely faking the love (WAY TOO predictable) for the throne and leaves her to die. Some snowman guy comes in and frees Anna and Anna decides she needs to kiss Kristoff to save herself (the really obvious love interest) because he is her true love. We then are shown Elsa freeing herself from captivity and creating a super blizzard. Hans, who is pursuing to kill her, stops her by proclaiming that Anna is dead. Elsa momentarily ceases the super blizzard and falls to the ground. Anna, who sees Hans about the kill Elsa, realizes she would rather die for her sister than save herself (but she is a selfless character, so makes sense). She runs up to Hans and turns into solid ice, destroying Hans sword and forcing him to the ground. Elsa turns around and sees her sister frozen and starts crying. Because this was supposedly an act of true love, Anna is freed from death. Elsa then says ""You sacrificed yourself to save me?"" WHAT THE HELL? If you knew he was going to kill you, your ice powers would have protected you anyway like they did during that fight in the palace. I guess they wanted to keep it from being the cliché 'guy kisses girl to save the girl' scene.After Anna is freed, Elsa realizes love is the answer to control her powers. Now here is what I really don't understand. Did Elsa hate her sister, her parents, her kingdom? I thought she was isolating her sister to protect her (an act of extremely selfish love, but still love). Why is love suddenly the answer if it was there all along? Weak. This is followed by the 'And everyone lived happily ever after' ending. The movie felt incoherent throughout. Elsa proclaims that love is the answer to control her powers even though it was there all along. Elsa knew Hans was about to attack her, but says to Anna ""you sacrificed yourself to save me?"" even though her ice powers would have defended her. The movie constantly sends mixed messages that are inexplicable and confusing. Characters like Kristoff and the Snowman and random songs (except ""Let it go"") were just thrown in to extend the time . The entire story is basically about Elsa's insecurities and Anna. The movie was at best average, but this was certainly not Disney at their prime. That honour belongs to Finding Nemo.","['definitely', 'disney', 'fine', 'take', 'educate', 'guess', 'say', 'people', 'claimed', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'saw', 'song', 'let', 'go',

761,4,"Okay, let's start off with the animation. Frozen is set in Scandinavia, it's beautiful and just breathtaking. The animation was wonderful and so beautiful. But Frozen's biggest downfall comes in the storyline. It's hard to say what the plot is about because this is one of those films that changes the plot as it sees fit. The biggest issue is that Anna, the ditzy younger selfish sister is given a love interest in someone who really isn't anything like her. Anna has always had what she wanted, whereas Elsa was locked away in a room because of her powers and one accident where Anna pushed despite Elsa's refusal. Elsa became fearful of her own emotions. Fearing to let anyone close. Until she breaks out of her shell. At which point we feel the story may be changing for the better. But, nope. This movie starts out about Elsa the Ice Queen, but really, it's all about how ""True Love Conquers All."". Anna is the main character of this film, not Elsa. Despite the Movie trying to make it about Elsa, it is ultimately all about Anna's Selfishness. This is what makes the movie terrible. There was so much potential, yet that potential just went to waste. In short, it's a decent movie but it's not what you'd expect. It ends up being mostly disappointing by the end.","['okay', 'let', 'start', 'animation', 'frozen', 'set', 'scandinavia', 'beautiful', 'breathtaking', 'animation', 'wonderful', 'beautiful', 'frozen', 'big', 'downfall', 'come', 'storyline', 'hard', 'say', 'plot', 'one', 'film', 'change', 'plot', 'see', 'fit', 'big', 'issue', 'anna', 'ditzy', 'young', 'selfish', 'sister', 'give', 'love', 'interest', 'someone', 'really', 'anything', 'like', 'anna', 'always', 'want', 'whereas', 'elsa', 'lock', 'away', 'room', 'power', 'one', 'accident', 'anna', 'push', 'despite', 'elsa', 'refusal', 'elsa', 'become', 'fearful', 'emotion', 'fear', 'let', 'anyone', 'close', 'break', 'shell', 'point', 'feel', 'story', 'may', 'change', 'well', 'nope', 'movie', 'start', 'elsa', 'ice', 'queen', 'really', 'true', 'love', 'conquers', 'anna', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'elsa', 'despite', 'movie', 'try', 'make', 'elsa', 'ultimately', 'anna', 'selfishness', 'make', 'movie', 'terrible', 'much', 'potential', 'yet', 'potential', 'go', 'waste', 'short', 'decent', 'movie', 'expect', 'end', 'mostly', 'disappoint', 'end']","[420, 30, 120, 21, 5, 144, 2071, 93, 905, 21, 215, 93, 5, 106, 40, 295, 307, 35, 52, 10, 3, 209, 52, 16, 560, 106, 519, 7, 73, 1558, 15, 57, 6, 122, 304, 22, 212, 9, 7, 163, 59, 1565, 4, 382, 101, 506, 24, 10, 480, 7, 809, 313, 4, 3572, 4, 179, 1604, 240, 187, 30, 299, 351, 340, 2760, 117, 53, 12, 171, 209, 18, 2881, 1, 120, 4, 33, 49, 22, 62, 6, 2099, 7, 119, 8, 3, 4, 313, 1, 87, 14, 4, 941, 7, 14, 1, 432, 31, 685, 182, 685, 13, 644, 263, 546, 1, 131, 41, 567, 808, 41]"
762,4,"I wasn't sold on seeing this one in the theaters because it looked like a ""filler"" animated film from Disney that appeared to only exist in order to take up space at a theater until Pixar decided to do another film and line The Mouse's pockets with sweaty, sexy cash. However, the critics raved about it, parents loved it because their kids loved it and tween girls everywhere went nuts because they finally had a Disney princess who was just as awkward as they were and, if smart phones existed in the fable of ""Frozen,"" she would be addressing this awkward revelation with an unhealthy amount of selfies.There is definitely an audience for this film—and here's a hint: They all act like the character of Anna and are the type who take pictures of themselves and post them online with the caption ""lol I'm awkward."" The reality is that I was just not meant for that audience. While the film isn't bad, the animation looks great (especially the snow effects) and Olaf the snowman is amusing and adorable, the fact remains I just wasn't impressed or interested in the final product. The characters weren't ones I could relate to or even care about (seriously, I really understood you wanted us to know that Anna was awkward but did you have to show it at all times?) and the songs just weren't catchy for me and I found them more annoying than anything else (I know you hate me now because I just admitted that I don't like the internet-adored ""Let It Go"").I'll admit that I admired that Disney was legitimately trying to make a true musical and not just one of their usual colorful story with an occasional catchy song but, in the end, I just wasn't sucked into the film and ended up finding ""Frozen"" to be something that didn't live up to the hype and was just another forgettable Disney film that doesn't hold a candle to such films as ""The Lion King"" and ""The Little Mermaid.""

But i quite liked the other characters, so it's a 6 stars, mediocre movie for Disney patterns.","['nearly', 'mid', 'movie', 'excite', 'sang', 'let', 'go', 'tought', 'elza', 'would', 'mighty', 'ice', 'witch', 'would', 'set', 'eternal', 'winter', 'kingdom', 'beyond', 'disappointed', 'put', 'random', 'usurper', 'villain', 'like', 'villain', 'disney', 'pretty', 'much', 'take', 'horn', 'king', 'maleficent', 'cruela', 'example', 'worth', 'title', 'villain', 'plot', 'movie', 'big', 'thing', 'ruin', 'uncharismatic', 'villain', 'love', 'solves', 'everything', 'scene', 'end', 'quite', 'like', 'character', 'star', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'disney', 'pattern']","[501, 1835, 1, 447, 1142, 30, 13, 26, 2664, 33, 1385, 26, 144, 310, 105, 77, 614, 476, 196, 1180, 104, 9, 104, 2, 136, 31, 55, 3860, 97, 1902, 396, 254, 590, 104, 52, 1, 106, 43, 851, 104, 6, 3313, 132, 90, 41, 124, 9, 8, 249, 752, 1, 2, 2062]"
765,4,"It's very difficult to write a review for Frozen. I did enjoy the movie and I rated it 6 stars (mainly for the visuals). Still, there are a couple of things that bothered me while watching. I think the visuals are really stunning. It feels like they put a lot of effort, time and even magic into the graphic designs of this movie. Kristen Bell is awesome as Anna and has a wonderful singing voice. I think the problem I have with this movie is on the story level.It feels like the writers didn't quite know where to go with this movie. It has no clear direction and purpose from the start. Of course, it is difficult to have a story with two main characters so it does not really 'work' that way. Although I really LOVE Anna as a character, maybe focusing on Elsa controlling her powers would have been better. Most of the characters are well done but it takes more than good characters to make a good story and I thought this animation was an example of that.I'm somewhat disappointed in the way they handle (or don't handle) pay-offs in this movie. Like Kristoff's obsession with ice should wind him up with Elsa, you would think... And there's the cool love song between Anna and Hans before... all of a sudden he turns out to be evil. I love a good twist in a movie but a twist should be traceable if you watch the movie again. There's absolutely no reason why Hans should have been a bad guy since Anna met him completely by accident. And she's not even the crown princess. So how do you motivate it to be premeditated foul play then? This felt a bit like lazy writing to me. ""Let's make him evil all of a sudden so she can date the other guy without remorse."" And why would Hans lock Elsa up if he could have killed her. He must have been planning to anyway as he always intended to become king and had no knowledge of Elsa's powers or what would happen. Why lock her up and let her escape? Why lock Anna up and tell everyone she's dead too soon. Everybody knows that's bound to lead to troubles. If one of the themes of the movie is True Love, then true love should be celebrated by cool songs, not false love. Also, there is little romantic tension between Anna and Kristoff, other than her rational consideration that he might love her because the frozen puppet tells her so (based on what actually? And what's the function of the puppet other than obvious 'comic' relief and potential for expensive children's toys?).They want to put so many perspectives in this movie, so many stories, that they lose track of the main story. And what is the main story anyway? Is it a classic love story? Is it the story of two sisters who care about each other? Or is it about Elsa trying to manage her powers and a kingdom? I would say it's mainly about those last two and in that case, focusing on Elsa would probably have made more sense. What if she had run away and had ended up traveling with Kristoff? What if in the meanwhile, Anna, who was never meant to become queen was having trouble handling an entire kingdom with the product of a day-long relationship? That would have made an interesting story. Having some match-making trolls sing a forced relationship into being doesn't quite do the trick for me. But hey, maybe I'm too critical. I notice a lot of people simply loved this story and that's a good thing! For me, though, there were a lot of loose ends in this story that made it difficult to really feel for the characters. If I compare this movie to Tangled, I think it doesn't match that level of storytelling by far. The story of Rapunzel was strikingly better written (even improved the original a lot), the lyrics were awesome while the songs in Frozen were rather forgettable. I noticed Alan Menken did not compose the music for Frozen only after I watched it and I thought: ""Yeah, that makes sense"". You have this fairy tale frozen wasteland that could have had a soundtrack like Edward Scissorhands or Narnia and yet you don't quite feel the magic. I watched Enchanted the day before, another one that remains great after many times. The music of Enchanted is witty and wonderful and the story is full of great humor and has a perfect pacing and structure. Frozen made me discover once again that great narrative build-up and Alan Menken make an unforgettable Disney movie. Without those ingredients, you get a fun Disney movie that does not even closely compare to the others when it comes to emotional impact and music. Also, I think the message this movie sends (if that is important at all) is a rather cynical one. Sure, it's great that true love is that between sisters for once (no big original surprise for me while watching). But basically it votes for love forced by shared experience and silly troll songs and states that love on first sight doesn't exist. Still, Frozen is definitely a 'to watch' because it looks gorgeous! Although I wonder if the makers used subliminal messages or hypnosis to cause this fan hysteria. Best Disney ever? Definitely NOT for me. If you want a visually gorgeous movie with a similar message and a good coherent story with a great build-up, try Malificent!","['difficult', 'write', 'review', 'frozen', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'rat',

766,3,"Well a story of two princesses is going to lean on the feminine side of storytelling no doubt but I have no problem with that if the story is engaging, well structured etc. People might accuse me of being sexist and they might be right in general but I am also an appreciator of good movies regardless of the tone be it masculine or feminine. This movie however doesn't satisfy me in that regard. Of course, the scriptwriter as I checked is a woman. And this is going to be important as I analyze the themes of this movie because I will take the author's gender and sensibilities into account. So basically the story fails to engage because of its simplicity and baseness. It is so based that it struggles to even be called a story since it almost has no deep characters with conflict, nor any metaphors or an underlying message hidden in between the lines. So basically you have an older and a younger princess. The older one is defined as having an extraordinary talent which allows her to freeze anything on touch, even build complex structures out of ice and give life (!) to a snowman. She is also a beautiful young blond. That would be her outward appearance and actions. Inwardly she is ""shy"" and closed because of the fear her power will hurt others and so has to act responsible and overly cautious. The younger sister is an ""ordinary"" girl by her own admission (or should I say the words of the female author). Maybe next movie we will have a villain stock character say ""I'm a villain"" or a cool hero stock character say ""I'm just a cool hero"". Anyway she is a gorgeous red-haired beauty that travels the movie with wide eyes and easily falls in love. Her inward appearance is vibrant, full of life and naive. So basically you have a ""conflict"" between two sisters. One tries to be responsible with her power, the other one tries to live her life to the fullest. This sets in motion a conflict free movie where the older sister has to stop the winter she unknowingly unleashed while the younger one is a protagonist who falls in love with any man she spends more than one minute with. So why is it a bad story? Like I said, written from a female perspective what we do have is a villain that is not threatening, a girl (young sister) that goes on a not so dangerous journey to talk to her sister (who we know loves her and is going to stop the winter in the end anyway since all of it is just one big misunderstanding). We, or at least I, know all this before it happens but the journey itself is boring. So the focus of the movie becomes the younger sister's interactions with a stranger that helps her travel to her older sister. She is already engaged to a prince back home, but spends most of the movie making the moves on the handsome stranger looking at him with wide eyes and basically acting innocent while being all over him. Well one female fantasy for certain was fulfilled while writing this script. Who will the younger sister choose? Her fiancé or the handsome and rugged stranger? Of course any woman would choose the dangerous stranger over the boring fiancé and that shows in the story. I admit I didn't watch till the end but apparently the fiancé at the end turns out to be bad. So I guess the woman screenwriter solved that dilemma efficiently. ""hmmm I don't want my girl to look bad by leaving her fiancé for another man so I am going to make the fiancé the last minute bad guy. That solves everything and absolves me from being morally reprehensible. This way I can live out the all-female fantasy."" What else? Oh yes, this entire movie wouldn't have happened if the trolls (side characters meant to be cute. Meant to be.) didn't advise the older sister to keep her powers hidden from everyone and live a life of shame and fear. So that is why I put the ""shy"" part in quotations when referring to the older sister's characteristics. She was forced to shy away because of one really ill gotten advice when she was a young girl. The real villain of the movie - the cute little trolls. For shame.","['well', 'story', 'two', 'princess', 'go', 'lean', 'feminine', 'side', 'storytelling', 'doubt', 'problem', 'story', 'engage', 'well', 'structure', 'etc', 'people', 'might', 'accuse',

Frozen had promise as well, but there were weak developments throughout and the big plot twist and everything after it were insulting to a viewer's intelligence.White became black, because the plot required it. Death was revoked with no explanations,because the resolution required it.

768,6,"Does this movie live up to the level of hype it got at first? I don't think so. For one thing, there are a lot of things about the characterization that are just plain sloppy. Elsa goes from being extremely reserved to ""letting it go"" so fast it felt unnatural. There needed to be more balance, nuance and subtlety in her character and less ""going from zero to sixty"" in a very short time. Another issue was Prince Hans, who was nothing but a huge cheat. The entire point of him was, ""Ohh, he's a villain! You didn't see that coming! HA HA!"" There was nothing about his character that was naturally developed or made sense. The whole point was to trick the audience, and that's it. Another huge issue in characterization is Anna and Elsa's sisterly relationship feeling very, very unrealistic. Elsa isolated herself from her sister for YEARS and YEARS, from Anna's view, for no reason. Anna acts WAY too friendly with her considering that, as far as Anna could tell, Elsa was being a jerk and abandoning her for no reason. This is especially severe considering that absolutely horrible parenting resulted in the two daughters being locked up in their castle for most of their lives. This movie seems to assume that familial relations will magically create strong relationships, but a lot of the strength of familial relationships comes from spending such a huge amount of time together, which Elsa and Anna obviously didn't. This might be one of the biggest problems in the movie, in my opinion. After all, sisterly love is one of the biggest themes in the movie, and yet they're not going to actually have it make sense or explore how sisterly love forms. In this movie, it's something that's just ""there"".Another problem is that the ""twist"" of the magical love needed not being romantic in nature was rather predictable and not much of a twist to me.There were also some things in this movie that just didn't make much sense, such as Elsa's powers, i.e. apparently being able to create life without even trying to, and how exactly she thawed everything out, etc.Overall, this movie felt like it was trying very hard to hit all the right notes with the public, and its success at doing so probably explains its immense popularity. And yet, there are many things about this movie that really need to be better before I'm willing to call it a ""great"" movie.At the same time...does this movie really deserve the level of backlash it received? I don't think so. It's understandable, considering its popularity, but still undeserved. There's no way this movie deserves to be called terrible or rated one star. Despite its weaknesses, it's still pretty enjoyable and immensely watchable overall. It has absolutely wonderful aesthetics, some great humor, catchy songs, likable characters, and a storyline which - despite its specific failures - is still fairly enjoyable in a broad sense. Overall, it isn't nearly as good as its hype might suggest, but it also just plain isn't as bad as some of its dissenters insist. If you watch it without letting the over-hypedness bother you, you'll probably enjoy yourself. Just don't expect too much.","['movie', 'live', 'level', 'hype', 'get', 'first', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'lot', 'thing', 'characterization', 'plain', 'sloppy', 'elsa', 'go', 'extremely', 'reserve', 'let', 'go', 'fast', 'felt', 'unnatural', 'need', 'balance', 'nuance', 'subtlety', 'character', 'less', 'go', 'zero', 'sixty', 'short', 'time', 'another', 'issue', 'prince', 'han', 'nothing', 'huge', 'cheat', 'entire', 'point', 'ohh', 'villain', 'see', 'come', 'ha', 'ha', 'nothing', 'character', 'naturally', 'developed', 'make', 'sense', 'whole', 'point', 'trick', 'audience', 'another', 'huge', 'issue', 'characterization', 'anna', 'elsa', 'sisterly', 'relationship', 'feel', 'unrealistic', 'elsa', 'isolated', 'sister', 'year', 'year', 'anna', 'view', 'reason', 'anna', 'act', 'way', 'friendly', 'consider', 'far', 'anna', 'could', 'tell', 'elsa', 'jerk', 'abandon', 'reason', 'especially', 'severe', 'consider', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'parent', 'result', 'two', 'daughter', 'lock', 'castle', 'life', 'movie', 'seem', 'assume', 'familial', 'relation', 'magically', 'create', 'strong', 'relationship', 'lot', 'strength', 'familial', 'relationship', 'come', 'spending', 'huge', 'amount', 'time', 'together', 'elsa', 'anna', 'obviously', 'might', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'movie', 'opinion', 'sisterly', 'love', 'one', 'big', 'theme', 'movie', 'yet', 'go', 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'explore', 'sisterly', 'love', 'form', 'movie', 'something', 'another', 'problem', 'twist', 'magical', 'love', 'need', 'romantic', 'nature', 'rather', 'predictable', 'much', 'twist', 'also', 'thing', 'movie', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'elsa', 'power', 'e', 'apparently', 'able', 'create', 'life', 'without', 'even', 'try', 'exactly', 'thawed', 'everything', 'etc', 'overall', 'movie', 'felt', 'like', 'try', 'hard', 'hit', 'right', 'note', 'public', 'success', 'probably', 'explains', 'immense', 'popularity', 'yet', 'many', 'thing', 'movie', 'really', 'need', 'well', 'willing', 'call', 'great', 'movie', 'time', 'movie', 'really', 'deserve', 'level', 'backlash', 'receive', 'think', 'understandable', 'consider', 'popularity', 'still', 'undeserved', 'way', 'movie', 'deserves', 'call', 'terrible', 'rat', 'one', 'star', 'despite', 'weakness', 'still', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'immensely', 'watchable', 'overall', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'aesthetic', 'great', 'humor', 'catchy', 'song', 'likable', 'character', 'storyline', 'despite', 'specific', 'failure', 'still', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'broad', 'sense', 'overall', 'nearly', 'good', 'hype', 'might', 'suggest', 'also', 'plain', 'bad', 'dissenter', 'insist', 'watch', 'without', 'let', 'hypedness', 'bother', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'expect', 'much']","[1, 224, 440, 406, 19, 36, 37, 10, 43, 84, 43, 1640, 915, 2111, 4, 13, 423, 1313, 30, 13, 780, 155, 2433, 99, 677, 2611, 2401, 8, 321, 13, 2208, 4974, 263, 20, 102, 519, 82, 44, 156, 360, 2522, 264, 117, 104, 16, 40, 2168, 2168, 156, 8, 1102, 610, 14, 217, 127, 117, 3113, 159, 102, 360, 519, 1640, 7, 4, 711, 153, 53, 2281, 4, 782, 15, 47, 47, 7, 413, 180, 7, 112, 50, 837, 421, 142, 7, 54, 143, 4, 2335, 1622, 180, 121, 3665, 421, 292, 896, 118, 648, 42, 389, 382, 168, 79, 1, 75, 2595, 3041, 1635, 1663, 134, 167, 153, 84, 887, 3041, 153, 40, 1407, 360, 624, 20, 332, 4, 7, 613, 252, 10, 106, 198, 1, 258, 711, 6, 10, 106, 226, 1, 182, 13, 103, 14, 217, 1423, 711, 6, 427, 1, 89, 102, 198, 129, 170, 6, 99, 393, 1094, 191, 331, 31, 129, 27, 43, 1, 14, 31, 217, 4, 24, 893, 755, 294, 134, 79, 137, 28, 87, 522, 2898, 132, 430, 166, 1, 155, 9, 87, 307, 234, 130, 625, 1328, 577, 210, 1497, 3042, 1872, 182, 61, 43, 1, 22, 99, 18, 1549, 308, 25, 1, 20, 1, 22, 483, 440, 3045, 852, 37, 2230, 421, 1872, 68, 4975, 50, 1, 592, 308, 432, 1055, 10, 249, 313, 2819, 68, 136, 306, 2625, 2495, 166, 292, 215, 3792, 25, 222, 266, 11, 402, 8, 295, 313, 1586, 1623, 68, 890, 306, 3781, 217, 166, 501, 17, 406, 252, 1049, 27, 915, 65, 3586, 23, 137, 30, 864, 210, 91, 131, 31]"
769,3,"Frozen is being claimed as a full out masterpiece, just perfect. I don't see it. It was just another stereotypical Disney movie. Now, there a few things I liked, so I'll do those first.Olaf the snowman was just another comic relief, he doesn't really stand out, but he's pretty funny and he's my favorite character. I enjoyed that the queen isn't evil, unlike many other Disney flicks, and the humor was only needed when it was needed. The fact that the main character doesn't officially find her true love is very refreshing.Now, the things I didn't like. One of the things that I didn't like were the songs. They were so bland, They really needed to put more creativity into them. The singer for ""Let It Go"" sounded like she was screaming during the high parts, and ""Love Is An Open Door"" seemed more like a parody of Disney sings than an actual Disney song. Hans as the villain was a decent plot twist, but he wants to take over the kingdom because he didn't get enough attention? Come on, you have some of the best Disney villains out there, and that's all you have? Plus, I don't think the movie needed an official villain. Society could have been the villain, which is true very often in real life. Another thing, how come Olaf came to life? The movie never explained, and they could have been more creative with this idea. The characters are very forgettable and I didn't feel very relatable to their problems. The trolls needed a much bigger role in this film, I enjoyed them and their background needed much bigger explanation. I feel like many scenes were deleted from the film, and maybe if I see an uncut version, the film would be much betterWill kids like it? Yeah. Can I see why everyone else likes it? Yeah.

770,3,"Being a huge fan of Disney movies i got to say, they continue to be less and less entertaining.First of all, the graphics look amazing, i loved this magical snow and the way they took shape, it was breathtaking. The characters on the other hand are realistic but i just can't stand how they make their doll faces. Is this the future of the characters? Princes and princesses being thin and handsome while others are being fat, on little legs and ugly.Now the musics... they are boring. Seriously i couldn't notice a difference between all of them except for ""Let it go"" and the one between Anna and Hans. But the lyrics are forgettable, i wasn't entertained at all. I was like : ""hey why did they take the same rhythm through all the movie?""Lots of plot's gaps like : - Why shut Elsa down even from light and toys? Why are the trolls close to the royal family? The chief who had powers too lived with his own kin and is happy with it, why not Elsa then? Why do they look exceptionally dumb? If he could foresee the danger of her power, couldn't he see he was the reason why in first place? Who ruled the kingdom between the death of the parents and the coronation? No bright mind i can assure you, nobody asked himself why she stood in her bedroom as her power remained secret from even her sister.From where Elsa got her power? How everybody listens to this Weseltown guy when the princess asked for no harm? How does Anna knows where Elsa built her snowy castle? How come newly met Hans becomes warden of the kingdom?How come true love isn't built? How come it's just decided in a sec?Is it only possible to take a kingdom like Hans is doing it? He has a bunch of older brothers who'll likely enter into war after that!Why so much useless songs especially the snowman's and the trolls' ones? Couldn't they fill the gaps with the time used by those songs?And the list goes on and on!!!Depth of the characters = 0. Anna is the most dumb princess i have ever seen, of course she loved her sister but she meets a random guy, wants to marry him in a matter of hours, has been deceived then *FLASH LIGHT* another loves me so i do love him too! First of all if you love someone like this then be deceived i hardly think you can heal up that fast, she didn't even cry! Kristoff loves her so what the hell why not take the chance and kiss him, i mean how MANIPULATING of her! what kind of love is that?!Hans is odd, he becomes the villain because there has to be one, but how has he been defeated? a punch in the face then shipped back to his kingdom... Under what laws do they live? don't they have cells in their castle? Even the Weseltown noble is more punished in the story...Trolls no background whatsoever but i didn't care much.Kristoff, who happens to be there, truly grows in love with Anna (i felt a bit heartbroken the way he left town after bringing Anna back, yeah no thanking, no ""you can come have a hot meal"", just get out... and he bravely accepts this, he just returns in the snow mountains in the middle of nowhere...). By the way, why did he say his only friends were the trolls? I recalled seeing people with him at the beginning, doesn't he have some friends in a village? He looked so alone and empty the whole movie!Elsa who's above all the greatest character in this movie but has been completely thrown away... She sacrifices so much for the sake of the people she loves (YES SHE LOVES so why after an hour or so LOVE IS THE KEY? And bibidiba bidiboo snow goes away from love) : her childhood, her freedom, her life in her kingdom! There has to be some more to be told about her! She's a twisted character who received no love from anyone besides her sister but gives so much and all she got was get out you freak? And when she finally casts her spell out everybody becomes happy and loving? nothing logical in here!I just don't want to talk about the snowman, he's completely irrelevant to the story and brings no fun at all, he's just some other annoying character like Jar Jar Binks. I know it's meant for kids but is that a reason to show dumb scenario? I took the price earned for this movie even more insulting! Everybody it's own opinion but stop saying it's the best Disney ever in ads, you don't decide for us because i think it's not by far : full of irrational decisions by the characters, no loving story, no true villain, it just happens and deal with it! How many people read the script and agreed on it?

771,4,"Frozen 1 is a movie that audiences of all ages, especially kids LOVE. It was so popular that Disney kept making merchandise for this movie even after it's theatrical run ended and they even released a sequel last year, which did even better than the original financially. I used to really enjoy this movie when it first came out but upon re-watching this, I now see this as a bad movie.What I liked about this movie is that many of its songs are outstanding, the animation is impressive as usual, the special effects are excellent, Elsa and Kristoff have a good point that you can't marry people you just met, the voice acting is great, they did a good job with the villain twist, at least there is some form of character development such as Elsa having remorse for her actions later on in the movie when Anna sacrifices her life to save Elsa and then brought Anna back to life and freed everyone from the everlasting winter curse, the ending is subpar and the story is barely passable overall.This film is far from perfect due to its bad qualities, such as the overuse of the parent/s dying trope, the plot is very cliched, the songs in this movie mainly exist as fillers, Elsa is the most unlikeable character in the entire movie as she is rude to everyone, she only cares about herself and is very cowardly as shown throughout the entire movie and especially in her song ""Let it Go"", ""Let it Go"" is a very poorly written song as sets a bad example for the audience in terms of leaving all their responsibilities behind and to be selfish and Sarah Silverman's song ""There's No Place Like Slaughter Race"" from Wreck it Ralph 2 is just as bad as it delivers the same terrible message to the audience, Olaf, as a comic relief character is more stupid and annoying than funny and the end credits scene is lackluster.Upon re-watching this movie to see how it holds up and to prepare for the sequel, I have come to the conclusion that I officially do not like this movie anymore.Along with the Yogi Bear movie, I still can't believe I ever liked this movie as a kid let alone winning a contest for merchandise plus free tickets to the movie and owning this movie on DVD. For this reason, I am now glad I gave all my Frozen merchandise away and never saw Frozen 2 in theaters (because I didn't bother after what Disney put me through with Wreck it Ralph 2 and the Lion King remake).If you are planning to watch this movie, personally I would pass on it unless you are either: a child or a parent with bored children wanting to be entertained.","['frozen', 'movie', 'audience', 'age', 'especially', 'kid', 'love', 'popular', 'disney', 'kept', 'make', 'merchandise', 'movie', 'even', 'theatrical', 'run', 'end', 'even', 'release', 'sequel', 'last', 'year', 'even', 'well', 'original', 'financially', 'use', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'first', 'come', 'upon', 'watch', 'see', 'bad', 'movie', 'like', 'movie', 'many', 'song', 'outstanding', 'animation', 'impressive', 'usual', 'special', 'effect', 'excellent', 'elsa', 'kristoff', 'good', 'point', 'marry', 'people', 'met', 'voice', 'act', 'great', 'good', 'job', 'villain', 'twist', 'least', 'form', 'character', 'development', 'elsa', 'remorse', 'action', 'later', 'movie', 'anna', 'sacrifice', 'life', 'save', 'elsa', 'brought', 'anna', 'back', 'life', 'freed', 'everyone', 'everlasting', 'winter', 'curse', 'end', 'subpar', 'story', 'barely', 'passable', 'overall', 'film', 'far', 'perfect', 'due', 'bad', 'quality', 'overuse', 'parent', 'die', 'trope', 'plot', 'cliched', 'song', 'movie', 'mainly', 'exist', 'filler', 'elsa', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'rude', 'everyone', 'care', 'cowardly', 'show', 'throughout', 'entire', 'movie', 'especially', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'let', 'go', 'poorly', 'write', 'song', 'set', 'bad', 'example', 'audience', 'term', 'leave', 'responsibility', 'behind', 'selfish', 'sarah', 'silverman', 'song', 'place', 'like', 'slaughter', 'race', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'bad', 'delivers', 'terrible', 'message', 'audience', 'olaf', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'stupid', 'annoy', 'funny', 'end', 'credit', 'scene', 'lackluster', 'upon', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'hold', 'prepare', 'sequel', 'come', 'conclusion', 'officially', 'like', 'movie', 'anymore', 'along', 'yogi', 'bear', 'movie', 'still', 'believe', 'ever', 'like', 'movie', 'kid', 'let', 'alone', 'win', 'contest', 'merchandise', 'plus', 'free', 'ticket', 'movie', 'movie', 'dvd', 'reason', 'glad', 'give', 'frozen', 'merchandise', 'away', 'never', 'saw', 'frozen', 'theater', 'bother', 'disney', 'put', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'lion', 'king', 'remake', 'planning', 'watch', 'movie', 'personally', 'would', 'pas', 'unless', 'either', 'child', 'parent', 'bore', 'child', 'want', 'entertain']","[5, 1, 159, 139, 121, 60, 6, 559, 2, 498, 14, 949, 1, 28, 2389, 233, 41, 28, 288, 561, 197, 47, 28, 18, 230, 3820, 158, 22, 91, 1, 36, 40, 554, 23, 16, 65, 1, 9, 1, 61, 11, 764, 21, 933, 562, 316, 278, 298, 4, 67, 17, 117, 390, 46, 392, 86, 112, 25, 17, 373, 104, 129, 250, 427, 8, 356, 4, 4969, 345, 358, 1, 7, 635, 79, 111, 4, 599, 7, 74, 79, 3908, 109, 2245, 105, 405, 41, 4973, 12, 944, 4056, 166, 3, 142, 175, 404, 65, 283, 3139, 118, 368, 1032, 52, 11, 1, 934, 1136, 1504, 4, 3894, 8, 264, 1, 2498, 109, 293, 3444, 78, 296, 264, 1, 121, 11, 30, 13, 30, 13, 1125, 165, 11, 144, 65, 396, 159, 657, 322, 1175, 750, 1558, 3913, 11, 188, 9, 1224, 352, 379, 65, 1143, 432, 185, 159, 32, 309, 297, 8, 494, 238, 85, 41, 662, 90, 1938, 554, 23, 1, 16, 655, 3099, 561, 40, 734, 2165, 9, 1, 892, 172, 2215, 1, 68, 220, 81, 9, 1, 60, 30, 344, 374, 4536, 949, 569, 593, 2070, 1, 1, 540, 180, 818, 57, 5, 949, 101, 88, 157, 5, 312, 864, 2, 196, 352, 379, 152, 97, 3196, 1888, 23, 1, 520, 26, 1204, 959, 353, 70, 118, 604, 70, 59, 243]"

But it's hold back by a weird convoluted story, weak characters and I hate musicals.My favorite character is Hans, for personal reasons, but even he is not a really fleshed out character because everything about him is a lie.I like the message of love this is really the strong point about this movie, with a great build up and an even better pay off. It is one of the few films in which the victim has saved itself and in which ""the love"" of a couple is not in focus.
BUT even that is ruled by it's stupid fake out death. (And yes that annoyed me already while watching.)Nevertheless, the film has not much to offer in terms of content, most of it is simply meaningless, it is just meaningless filler and it only tries to keep the children occupied instead of really entertaining or teaching them.I openly admit after watching the movie I was happy for a week and wanted to tell everyone how much I like it. BUT when I really had to tell people what or why I liked it I noticed how much imade no sense, had no purpose and how stupid I felt.This is not a junk food movie because even junk food can taste good, this movie is opium.","['really', 'competent', 'make', 'movie', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'act', 'hold', 'back', 'weird', 'convolute', 'story', 'weak', 'character', 'hate', 'musical', 'favorite', 'character', 'han', 'personal', 'reason', 'even', 'really', 'flesh', 'character', 'everything', 'lie', 'like', 'message', 'love', 'really', 'strong', 'point', 'movie', 'great', 'build', 'even', 'well', 'pay', 'one', 'film', 'victim', 'save', 'love', 'couple', 'focus', 'even', 'rule', 'stupid', 'fake', 'death', 'yes', 'annoyed', 'already', 'watch', 'nevertheless', 'film', 'much', 'offer', 'term', 'content', 'simply', 'meaningless', 'meaningless', 'filler', 'try', 'keep', 'child', 'occupy', 'instead', 'really', 'entertain', 'teach', 'openly', 'admit', 'watch', 'movie', 'happy', 'week', 'want', 'tell', 'everyone', 'much', 'like', 'really', 'tell', 'people', 'like', 'notice', 'much', 'imade', 'sense', 'purpose', 'stupid', 'felt', 'junk', 'food', 'movie', 'even', 'junk', 'food', 'taste', 'good', 'movie', 'opium']","[22, 4977, 14, 1, 444, 21, 93, 86, 112, 655, 74, 1063, 3445, 12, 434, 8, 333, 51, 189, 8, 44, 537, 180, 28, 22, 1620, 8, 132, 1152, 9, 185, 6, 22, 167, 117, 1, 25, 202, 28, 18, 963, 10, 3, 2786, 111, 6, 398, 261, 28, 788, 494, 1537, 517, 325, 1127, 397, 23, 1554, 3, 31, 705, 657, 1370, 341, 2618, 2618, 1504, 87, 154, 70, 3010, 208, 22, 243, 621, 3765, 637, 23, 1, 301, 1078, 59, 143, 109, 31, 9, 22, 143, 46, 9, 692, 31, 217, 646, 494, 155, 3914, 2098, 1, 28, 3914, 2098, 1120, 17, 1]"
773,1,"(No overt spoilers below, but a few allusions to the developments at the end of the movie.)There are many things I like about this film, and several things I didn't.I loved the Nordic setting and the historically accurate European ambiance. The truth is, fairy-tale films work best when they're set in the land that gave birth to them (Europe) and when they're recognizably historic looking, in terms of architecture, settings, and demographics, as is this one.The visuals are spectacular. It's one of the most beautiful films to look at that I've ever seen. The characters are likewise very attractive, with Elsa in particular being one of Disney's most beautiful princesses ever.Elsa is an excellent character, extremely fascinating and original -- so much so that she should have been the main protagonist. Disney has made princess movies around much less interesting characters in the past, so this time, when they finally came up with a character who is so incredibly complex and sympathetic, the film should definitely have focused on her. And after her years of solitude, it should certainly have given her a love story, like a gender-flipped version of Beauty and the Beast, with Elsa in the role of the quasi-Beast who is redeemed by the love of a warm-hearted man. It should have saved the sister story for a different project. Giving Anna a love story instead of Elsa seems painfully unbalanced, especially given that Elsa suffers years of tragic isolation and has to inhibit her emotions, while Anna is merely lonely.I didn't like Anna, who is yet another example of the feisty, aggressive tomboys who lately seem to be the leads in nearly every movie in this genre (Rapunzel somewhat excepted). Characters like her are becoming terribly clichéd, which makes it hard to empathize with Anna. Also, I didn't really see her problem as being that acute, relatively speaking: so she's been alone a lot in her life. So what? She can't read books? Sneak out of the castle? Get some fresh air? There are worse problems to have -- like her sister's plight, for example, which rivals that of the Phantom in Phantom of the Opera in making Elsa a truly tragic figure.Kristoff could have been a much more interesting character, if there had been more of an edge to his personality. Most of the time, he just seems like a tag-along to Anna with little purpose in the story. He is too easygoing to be a craggy loner type and too light-hearted to be a rogue. Just seems like an ordinary nice guy.Too much of the film constitutes yet another road-trip movie, with Kristoff and Anna being a far less interesting and far less likable pair than Flynn and Rapunzel.Instead of this, more of the film should have taken place in the ice palace that Elsa creates, which is a spectacular creation, easily as interesting as the Beast's castle in Beauty and the Beast, and more of the storyline should have involved Elsa and her plight.Hans could have been a great character, and even as the movie stands, he has some terrific moments in the middle of the film, but the storyline ultimately ruins him.Marshmallow is a thrilling and powerful film presence. Olaf is tolerable. The trolls are excruciatingly unfunny and out of place.The movie has its share of twists, one of which – the big one – seems painfully contrived and unpersuasive.The ending is kind of weak and lacks the joy that you usually feel in Disney films, when a romantic couple gets together.The songs are likewise a mixed bag, ranging from the excellent (Let It Go, Frozen Heart, For the First Time in Forever) to the mundane (Fixer Upper, In Summer, Love is an Open Door) There's a lot to love in this movie, no doubt about it, and it's worth seeing for Elsa alone, as well a for Marshmallow, Arendelle, the culture, the landscapes, the visuals, and at least in the middle part, for the character of Hans.All in all, it's probably a bit better than Tangled, and both this and Tangled are indeed Disney's best movies since The Lion King. But it could have been an even more powerful and timeless movie if it had been blemished by fewer of its grating, modern touches and if it had devoted more of its storyline to its finest character, Elsa.","['overt', 'spoiler', 'allusion', 'development', 'end', 'movie', 'many', 'thing', 'like', 'film', 'several', 'thing', 'love', 'nordic', 'set', 'historically', 'accurate', 'european',

774,10,"The years between 1989 and 1999 is known as the age in which Disney became the god of animation. Films as The little mermaid, Beauty and the beast and the Lion King are considered to be some of the greatest movies in history. But the quality of Disney movies reduces when we entered the new millennium, with Home on the Ranch as the movie that killed Disney's hand-drawn animation.Disney was finally back in business after 2009 with movies as The princes and the Frog, Tangled en Wreck 'it Ralph. When Frozen was announced, people thought that it will be like Tangled, but than with snow. But they are all wrong.Here is the story in short. The story centers around two sisters, Anna and Elsa. Elsa, the oldest of the two, has the power of creating ice and snow. On one night while playing with her powers, Elsa accidentally hurt Anna with her ice. She will heal from it, but will forget that Elsa had ice powers. The king and queen isolated Elsa from Anna in order to protect her from hurting Anna. When Elsa was at age, she became queen of the country. She accidentally showed her ice powers to everyone, and flees into the mountains while the kingdom was set into an internal winter. The rest of the plot is that Anna is trying to save the kingdom and reunite with Elsa.The story is one of the best ever, because it is like the typical Disney formula, but centers around the relationship of two sisters (Lilo and Stitch is the only one coming close to that).The animation is just fantastic. The best part of it is the effects on the snow and ice. It is like the water effects in Finding Nemo, and it looks real. The characters are great and memorable, with Anna and Elsa as the best of them. Elsa is probably the best complex character since the Beast from Beauty and the Beast. another great one is Olaf the talking snowman (do not believe the trailers. He is not annoying as hell).The songs are the greatest since the early Disney Renaissance. Every song is great and memorable, from First time in forever to Let it Go (the one that won the Oscar of best original song).To keep it short. This is a must watch for Disney fans, animation fans and everyone else. It is the Lion King of this new Disney age.","['year', 'know', 'age', 'disney', 'become', 'god', 'animation', 'film', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'consider', 'great', 'movie', 'history', 'quality', 'disney', 'movie', 'reduces', 'enter', 'new', 'millennium', 'home', 'ranch', 'movie', 'kill', 'disney', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'disney', 'finally', 'back', 'business', 'movie', 'prince', 'frog', 'tangle', 'en', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'frozen', 'announce', 'people', 'thought', 'like', 'tangle', 'snow', 'wrong', 'story', 'short', 'story', 'center', 'around', 'two', 'sister', 'anna', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'old', 'two', 'power', 'create', 'ice', 'snow', 'one', 'night', 'play', 'power', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'hurt', 'anna', 'ice', 'heal', 'forget', 'elsa', 'ice', 'power', 'king', 'queen', 'isolated', 'elsa', 'anna', 'order', 'protect', 'hurt', 'anna', 'elsa', 'age', 'become', 'queen', 'country', 'accidentally', 'show', 'ice', 'power', 'everyone', 'flees', 'mountain', 'kingdom', 'set', 'internal', 'winter', 'rest', 'plot', 'anna', 'try', 'save', 'kingdom', 'reunite', 'elsa', 'story', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'like', 'typical', 'disney', 'formula', 'center', 'around', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'lilo', 'stitch', 'one', 'come', 'close', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'best', 'part', 'effect', 'snow', 'ice', 'like', 'water', 'effect', 'find', 'nemo', 'look', 'real', 'character', 'great', 'memorable', 'anna', 'elsa', 'best', 'elsa', 'probably', 'best', 'complex', 'character', 'since', 'beast', 'beauty', 'beast', 'another', 'great', 'one', 'olaf', 'talk', 'snowman', 'believe', 'trailer', 'annoy', 'hell', 'song', 'great', 'since', 'early', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'every', 'song', 'great', 'memorable', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'let', 'go', 'one', 'oscar', 'best', 'original', 'song', 'keep', 'short', 'must', 'watch', 'disney', 'fan', 'animation', 'fan', 'everyone', 'else', 'lion', 'king', 'new', 'disney', 'age']","[47, 56, 139, 2, 179, 1006, 21, 3, 48, 422, 149, 203, 152, 97, 421, 25, 1, 636, 283, 2, 1, 1683, 108, 4399, 533, 1, 286, 2, 323, 747, 21, 2, 241, 74, 1523, 1, 82, 659, 83, 3453, 352, 379, 5, 46, 92, 9, 83, 39, 280, 12, 263, 12, 649, 200, 42, 15, 7, 4, 4, 64, 42, 24, 134, 33, 39, 10, 773, 204, 24, 4, 300, 305, 7, 33, 1234, 746, 4, 33, 24, 97, 49, 782, 4, 7, 496, 513, 305, 7, 4, 139, 179, 49, 872, 300, 78, 33, 24, 109, 710, 214, 77, 144, 1517, 105, 303, 52, 7, 87, 111, 77, 1793, 4, 12, 10, 34, 81, 9, 376, 2, 534, 649, 200, 153, 42, 15, 3315, 2274, 10, 40, 351, 21, 253, 34, 94, 278, 39, 33, 9, 1013, 278, 71, 1411, 66, 195, 8, 25, 268, 7, 4, 34, 4, 210, 34, 771, 8, 98, 203, 149, 203, 102, 25, 10, 32, 178, 45, 220, 394, 238, 778, 11, 25, 98, 594, 2, 465, 115, 11, 25, 268, 36, 20, 287, 30, 13, 10, 302, 34, 230, 11, 154, 263, 236, 23, 2, 176, 21, 176, 109, 270, 152, 97, 108, 2, 139]"
775,8,"Finally watched Frozen. Prior to watching I found all the songs people were singing rather annoying, but now it won't be annoying. In fact it will be a nail through the heart of the pure musicality the movie presents. By far one of the better Disney soundtrack. (Fun fact the song at the beginning to the movie at first doesn't seem to fit the movie at all, until you listen to the words. The lyrics of the first song basically foreshadow the entire movie). While Wreck-it-Ralph and Tangled were fair and decent displays of Disney's modern animation capabilities, Frozen by far has definitely surpassed the display of it's predecessors while keeping it's recognizable unique style. Plot kept me interested through out the movie and there weren't any real parts I could have guessed. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT. While there were some parts I saw I could only think ""this will not end well"" I was never able to truly guess exactly how it would turn out. With few holes and an emotional climax, it was well developed. My only real issue with the plot is I feel it could have been drawn out more and expressed in deeper detail. The characters in Frozen were generally well developed, but a bit more of a back story on Christof would have been desirable (all I really know about him is he was an orphan raised by people on Garry's mod with nothing better to do, and he sells ice and has a distaste for people). Casting isn't really my biggest concern other than I felt the chosen cast did their job excellently. As far as movies go, it was great. Well thought out with amazing writing and plot. So as far as my meaningless rating that carries no real weight due to the fact I am not an officially licensed or trusted critic I'll give a 8 out of 10. It was great, but definitely had a little more room for character development (Hans is a jerk), and a longer slightly deeper plot would have put this in the 9 zone. Personally my favorite thing about Frozen was it's soundtrack. I'm not one for musicals and I'll be honest a few of the songs were just waaaaaaaaay to close together, but they were well written and gave more life to a great movie. Generally I give soundtracks their own separate rating due to the fact that sometimes there are terrible movies with amazing soundtracks, and great movies with disgusting soundtracks.I'll finish up by throwing in some of my personal favorites:Favorite character: Most people jump straight for Olaf, but I'm going to have to say mine was Elsa. She was probably one of the characters that perfectly displayed emotion and thoughts. The entire time I could feel the tension between her and the rest of the world and most of all her feeling of being trapped by something that got out of hand. The mirrored emotions I got from her character just wouldn't justify me favoring any other character.Favorite part: The part that wowed me the most was the construction of the super ice castle of awesomeness. My second favorite part would have to be Hans getting decked in the face.Favorite song: This is a tricky one... I'll be honest the song that stood out the most has to be ""Let it Go"". While prior to me seeing the movie I found it aggravating this was my baby sister's song of choice to say the 3 words of the chorus over and over and over again, this song by far was the most well done. That with it being paired with the unbelievable trippy stuff going on with the ice castle of awesome makes it by far the song that everyone remembers. A notable mention would have to be the song at the beginning. That one would have won if it had the length to sustain it.Oh, and yes I fully understand, this movie was a chick-flic, but a great chick-flic.","['finally', 'watch', 'frozen', 'prior', 'watch', 'found', 'song', 'people', 'sing', 'rather', 'annoy', 'annoy', 'fact', 'nail', 'heart', 'pure', 'musicality', 'movie', 'present', 'far', 'one', 'well', 'disney', 'soundtrack', 'fun', 'fact', 'song', 'begin', 'movie', 'first', 'seem', 'fit', 'movie', 'listen', 'word', 'lyric', 'first', 'song', 'basically', 'foreshadow', 'entire', 'movie', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'tangle', 'fair', 'decent', 'display', 'disney', 'modern', 'animation', 'capability', 'frozen', 'far', 'definitely', 'surpass', 'display', 'predecessor', 'keep', 'recognizable', 'unique', 'style', 'plot', 'kept', 'interested', 'movie', 'real', 'part', 'could', 'guess', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'part', 'saw', 'could', 'think', 'end', 'well', 'never', 'able', 'truly', 'guess', 'exactly', 'would', 'turn', 'hole', 'emotional', 'climax', 'well', 'developed', 'real', 'issue', 'plot', 'feel', 'could', 'drawn', 'express', 'deeper', 'detail', 'character', 'frozen', 'generally', 'well', 'developed', 'bit', 'back', 'story', 'christof', 'would', 'desirable', 'really', 'know', 'orphan', 'raise', 'people', 'garry', 'mod', 'nothing', 'well', 'sell', 'ice', 'distaste', 'people', 'cast', 'really', 'big', 'concern', 'felt', 'chosen', 'cast', 'job', 'excellently', 'far', 'movie', 'go', 'great', 'well', 'thought', 'amaze', 'write', 'plot', 'far', 'meaningless', 'rating', 'carry', 'real', 'weight', 'due', 'fact', 'officially', 'license', 'trust', 'critic', 'give', 'great', 'definitely', 'little', 'room', 'character', 'development', 'han', 'jerk', 'longer', 'slightly', 'deeper', 'plot', 'would', 'put', 'zone', 'personally', 'favorite', 'thing', 'frozen', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'musical', 'honest', 'song', 'waaaaaaaaay', 'close', 'together', 'well', 'write', 'give', 'life', 'great', 'movie', 'generally', 'give', 'soundtrack', 'separate', 'rating', 'due', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'terrible', 'movie', 'amaze', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'movie', 'disgust', 'soundtrack', 'finish', 'throw', 'personal', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'character', 'people', 'jump', 'straight', 'olaf', 'go', 'say', 'mine', 'elsa', 'probably', 'one', 'character', 'perfectly', 'displayed', 'emotion', 'thought', 'entire', 'time', 'could', 'feel', 'tension', 'rest', 'world', 'feel', 'trap', 'something', 'get', 'hand', 'mirror', 'emotion', 'get', 'character', 'justify', 'favor', 'character', 'favorite', 'part', 'part', 'wowed', 'construction', 'super', 'ice', 'castle', 'awesomeness', 'second', 'favorite', 'part', 'would', 'han', 'get', 'deck', 'face', 'favorite', 'song', 'tricky', 'one', 'honest', 'song', 'stood', 'let', 'go', 'prior', 'see', 'movie', 'found', 'aggravate', 'baby', 'sister', 'song', 'choice', 'say', 'word', 'chorus', 'song', 'far', 'well', 'pair', 'unbelievable', 'trippy', 'stuff', 'go', 'ice', 'castle', 'awesome', 'make', 'far', 'song', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'notable', 'mention', 'would', 'song', 'begin', 'one', 'would', 'length', 'sustain', 'oh', 'yes', 'fully', 'understand', 'movie', 'chick', 'flic', 'great', 'chick', 'flic']","[241, 23, 5, 1883, 23, 231, 11, 46, 63, 191, 238, 238, 201, 2418, 80, 724, 1, 663, 142, 10, 18, 2, 225, 125, 201, 11, 160, 1, 36, 75, 560, 1, 531, 548, 475, 36, 11, 570, 2642, 264, 1, 352, 379, 83, 1257, 546, 1151, 2, 324, 21, 5, 142, 174, 1445, 1151, 2693, 154, 4982, 414, 355, 52, 498, 946, 1, 195, 94, 54, 388, 419, 1741, 419, 1741, 419, 1741, 94, 157, 54, 37, 41, 18, 88, 294, 329, 388, 522, 26, 113, 697, 342, 792, 18, 610, 195, 519, 52, 53, 54, 747, 1099, 1354, 468, 8, 5, 1004, 18, 610, 95, 74, 12, 3109, 26, 2893, 22, 56, 2291, 760, 46, 156, 18, 718, 33, 46, 227, 22, 106, 1844, 155, 1841, 227, 373, 2201, 142, 1, 13, 25, 18, 92, 96, 165, 52, 142, 2618, 437, 853, 195, 2280, 404, 201, 2165, 836, 730, 57, 25, 174, 48, 506, 8, 356, 44, 2335, 612, 774, 1354, 52, 26, 196, 3917, 520, 189, 43, 5, 225, 10, 51, 742, 11, 351, 332, 18, 165, 57, 79, 25, 1, 1004, 57, 225, 786, 437, 404, 201, 504, 432, 1, 96, 225, 25, 1, 1733, 225, 855, 744, 537, 189, 189, 8, 46, 1439, 984, 32, 13, 35, 2514, 4, 210, 10, 8, 456, 4983, 240, 92, 264, 20, 54, 53, 1214, 303, 126, 53, 900, 89, 19, 323, 1944, 240, 19, 8, 2974, 2005, 8, 189, 94, 94, 2651, 998, 33, 168, 319, 189, 94, 26, 44, 19, 381, 189, 11, 4698, 10, 742, 11, 1485, 30, 13, 1883, 16, 1, 231, 3438, 2286, 15, 11, 862, 35, 548, 2087, 11, 142, 18, 1441, 2128, 698, 13, 33, 168, 338, 14, 142, 11, 109, 1805, 348, 26, 11, 160, 10, 26, 1465, 4409, 425, 325, 822, 216, 1, 2038, 4984, 25, 2038, 4984]"

I also loved how the love story wasn't love at first sight. Anna fell in love with time. I cried during the first twenty minutes of the movie. It was amazing how they made me care for the characters so quickly. I liked Anna more than Elsa but I thought both of them were very well developed. The songs were amazing, some of my favorite Disney songs. it might be a little obvious how the movie was going to end but Frozen was a milestone in my opinion.

777,9,"Among others, Treason is a major theme of the movie. It has a tad of importance in bringing tension to the story. It is the gateway used to captivate and avails the audience attention. There are three main causes of treason in Frozen; Elsa's ambiguous treason to the sisterly love between her and Anna, Arendelle's miscomprehension of Elsa's attitude, and Hans's treason towards Anna.The first impression of treason in Frozen plays an important part by which the story unfolds to the climax as it helps the audience to better understand Elsa's fear, overprotective character and personality. It happens at the end of the coronation day when Elsa neglects Anna's pretense of true love and asks her to leave Arendelle. At this moment, we are able to better understand the gap in the relation they share since Anna's childhood accident. This is in fact the result of the translucent but real love that Elsa has for her younger sister. Her excessive want of protecting Anna from her powers makes her the reckless, inappropriate and non-caring sister for Anna especially at this moment of the film.The most important act of treason which hovers around the climax of the movie though is Arendelle's miscomprehension and reject of their newly coronated Queen whom they consider as a terrible monster and threat for the Kingdom. The way Arendelle responds to Elsa adds up to her fear which causes her to escape the Kingdom, to settle and alone herself on the North Mountains where she believes to be free and evacuates her long concealed fear. This feeling of treason continues to exist till the end of the sequel when she is imprisoned and sentence to death by Prince Hans.Further in treason, Hans clearly shows his real motivation of loving Anna when he refuses to kiss the latter in hope that she will die since she has been struck to the heart by Elsa. By this means would make him heir, hope and King of Arendelle. This act of treason helps to expand before its conclusion one of the major theme which is Love. It gives much more meaning to Anna and Hans' song ""Love Is An Open Door."" Anna's quest for affectionate love and Hans' who seeks only in establishing himself in a Kingdom completely outmatch the audiences' hope of true love one might thing the two of them would be sharing. Hans's treason also provides scope for the newly discovered but early developing true love between Kristoff and Anna.Treason is not only a theme which covers the plot but also an important feature which makes the conclusion of the movie much more beautiful as it is said that ""Love will thaw."" Certainly, at the end Love prevails upon treason which seems more like a mere oblivion in the conclusion of the movie.","['among', 'others', 'treason', 'major', 'theme', 'movie', 'tad', 'importance', 'bring', 'tension', 'story', 'gateway', 'use', 'captivate', 'avail', 'audience', 'attention', 'three', 'main', 'cause', 'treason', 'frozen', 'elsa', 'ambiguous', 'treason', 'sisterly', 'love', 'anna', 'arendelle', 'miscomprehension', 'elsa', 'attitude', 'han', 'treason', 'towards', 'anna', 'first', 'impression', 'treason', 'frozen', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'unfolds', 'climax', 'help', 'audience', 'well', 'understand', 'elsa', 'fear', 'overprotective', 'character', 'personality', 'happens', 'end', 'coronation', 'day', 'elsa', 'neglect', 'anna', 'pretense', 'true', 'love', 'asks', 'leave', 'arendelle', 'moment', 'able', 'well', 'understand', 'gap', 'relation', 'share', 'since', 'anna', 'childhood', 'accident', 'fact', 'result', 'translucent', 'real', 'love', 'elsa', 'young', 'sister', 'excessive', 'want', 'protect', 'anna', 'power', 'make', 'reckless', 'inappropriate', 'non', 'care', 'sister', 'anna', 'especially', 'moment', 'film', 'important', 'act', 'treason', 'hovers', 'around', 'climax', 'movie', 'though', 'arendelle', 'miscomprehension', 'reject', 'newly', 'coronate', 'queen', 'consider', 'terrible', 'monster', 'threat', 'kingdom', 'way', 'arendelle', 'responds', 'elsa', 'add', 'fear', 'cause', 'escape', 'kingdom', 'settle', 'alone', 'north', 'mountain', 'believe', 'free', 'evacuates', 'long', 'conceal', 'fear', 'feel', 'treason', 'continue', 'exist', 'till', 'end', 'sequel', 'imprison', 'sentence', 'death', 'prince', 'han', 'far', 'treason', 'han', 'clearly', 'show', 'real', 'motivation', 'love', 'anna', 'refuse', 'kiss', 'latter', 'hope', 'die', 'since', 'struck', 'heart', 'elsa', 'mean', 'would', 'make', 'heir', 'hope', 'king', 'arendelle', 'act', 'treason', 'help', 'expand', 'conclusion', 'one', 'major', 'theme', 'love', 'give', 'much', 'meaning', 'anna', 'han', 'song', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'anna', 'quest', 'affectionate', 'love', 'han', 'seek', 'establish', 'kingdom', 'completely', 'outmatch', 'audience', 'hope', 'true', 'love', 'one', 'might', 'thing', 'two', 'would', 'share', 'han', 'treason', 'also', 'provide', 'scope', 'newly', 'discover', 'early', 'develop', 'true', 'love', 'kristoff', 'anna', 'treason', 'theme', 'cover', 'plot', 'also', 'important', 'feature', 'make', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'much', 'beautiful', 'say', 'love', 'thaw', 'certainly', 'end', 'love', 'prevails', 'upon', 'treason', 'seem', 'like', 'mere', 'oblivion', 'conclusion', 'movie']","[471, 247, 1181, 823, 226, 1, 2223, 1259, 221, 1214, 12, 158, 1024, 3518, 159, 541, 433, 119, 328, 1181, 5, 4, 3142, 1181, 711, 6, 7, 199, 4986, 4, 1536, 44, 1181, 538, 7, 36, 1118, 1181, 5, 204, 289, 94, 12, 4155, 792, 135, 159, 18, 216, 4, 187, 4647, 8, 407, 591, 41, 343, 138, 4, 3905, 7, 62, 6, 1760, 322, 199, 133, 294, 18, 216, 1770, 1635, 781, 98, 7, 466, 480, 201, 648, 195, 6, 4, 73, 15, 2605, 59, 513, 7, 24, 14, 2072, 1085, 293, 15, 7, 121, 133, 3, 289, 112, 1181, 200, 792, 1, 100, 199, 4986, 1836, 1587, 3871, 49, 421, 432, 495, 2180, 77, 50, 199, 4634, 4, 269, 187, 328, 950, 77, 2037, 344, 1252, 214, 220, 593, 169, 1232, 187, 53, 1181, 647, 1136, 1087, 41, 561, 2706, 2361, 517, 82, 44, 142, 1181, 44, 690, 78, 195, 2035, 6, 7, 1383, 372, 955, 384, 368, 98, 1367, 80, 4, 218, 26, 14, 1647, 384, 97, 199, 112, 1181, 135, 2506, 734, 10, 823, 226, 6, 57, 31, 672, 7, 44, 11, 6, 318, 478, 7, 1527, 3610, 6, 44, 997, 2170, 77, 291, 159, 384, 62, 6, 10, 252, 43, 42, 26, 781, 44, 1181, 27, 458, 2697, 1587, 987, 594, 917, 62, 6, 67, 7, 1181, 226, 712, 52, 27, 289, 229, 14, 734, 1, 31, 93, 35, 6, 775, 442, 41, 6, 554, 1181, 75, 9, 1876, 4672, 734, 1]"
778,9,"I have wanted to see this film since I saw the teaser trailer featuring Olaf, a goofy yet cute and funny snowman and Sven, a dog-like and equally hilarious reindeer. Both my mother and I laughed at the trailer really hard when we saw it at the cinema before 'Monsters, University.' The official trailer was also good and I liked the line, ""That's no blizzard, that's my sister!"" that wasn't included in the final cut of the film much to my disappointment because it is funny, clever and as sassy as Anna is. I watched this film on Amazon Prime Instant Video last night and it met some of my expectations, particularly the story, the visuals and the music but I felt certain elements were similar to those from 'Tangled,' particularly Anna and Elsa being modelled in a similar manner to Rapunzel, the horses looking like Maximus, Sven behaving like him, Anna's gingery-brown hair changing colour when Elsa strikes her like Rapunzel's did when her long, golden hair was cut off and the kingdom here looking a little similar to that in 'Tangled.'Other than the similarities to 'Tangled,' this film has many positive aspects such as the animation being as good as that in 'Tangled,' 'Wreck-It Ralph' and recent Pixar films, the stunning visuals with beautiful, cool and rich colours, Anna, Elsa and Kristoff all looking cute as children, the attractive special effects and the excellent soundtrack. My favourite songs are 'For The First Time In Forever,' 'Love Is An Open Door, and 'Let It Go (I didn't like this song too much to begin with because it sounded a bit too shrill for my liking but when I heard it on Heat Radio when they were playing movie songs all day to celebrate the Oscars, it has grown on me since).' While one reviewer wasn't hugely keen on 'Fixer Upper,' the song performed by the trolls, I personally found it the funniest song in the film while 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman?' primarily sung by young Anna is sweet. I also liked the acapella opening music and while the score wasn't quite as memorable, it had its moments of beauty and tension although it became more memorable since I purchased the soundtrack on CD. The film was quite fast-paced and the story and dialogue were dramatic with the odd heartwarming and funny moment and I was happy that the ending used bits of animation from the teaser trailer on Olaf. The voice acting was exceptional, particularly from Kristen Bell as Anna and Idina Menzel (Nancy Tremaine in 'Enchanted') as Elsa. Overall, this film didn't quite impress me as much as 'Tangled' did due to its similarities but it was worth watching thanks to its story, music and visuals. 8.5/10 to round up to IMDb's 9/10 rating.","['want', 'see', 'film', 'since', 'saw', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'feature', 'olaf', 'goofy', 'yet', 'cute', 'funny', 'snowman', 'sven', 'dog', 'like', 'equally', 'hilarious', 'reindeer', 'mother', 'laugh', 'trailer', 'really', 'hard', 'saw', 'cinema', 'monster', 'university', 'official', 'trailer', 'also', 'good', 'like', 'line', 'blizzard', 'sister', 'include', 'final', 'cut', 'film', 'much', 'disappointment', 'funny', 'clever', 'sassy', 'anna', 'watch', 'film', 'amazon', 'prime', 'instant', 'video', 'last', 'night', 'met', 'expectation', 'particularly', 'story', 'visuals', 'music', 'felt', 'certain', 'element', 'similar', 'tangle', 'particularly', 'anna', 'elsa', 'model', 'similar', 'manner', 'rapunzel', 'horse', 'look', 'like', 'maximus', 'sven', 'behaving', 'like', 'anna', 'gingery', 'brown', 'hair', 'change', 'colour', 'elsa', 'strike', 'like', 'rapunzel', 'long', 'golden', 'hair', 'cut', 'kingdom', 'look', 'little', 'similar', 'tangle', 'similarity', 'tangle', 'film', 'many', 'positive', 'aspect', 'animation', 'good', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'recent', 'pixar', 'film', 'stun', 'visuals', 'beautiful', 'cool', 'rich', 'colour', 'anna', 'elsa', 'kristoff', 'look', 'cute', 'child', 'attractive', 'special', 'effect', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'favourite', 'song', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'let', 'go', 'like', 'song', 'much', 'begin', 'sound', 'bit', 'shrill', 'like', 'heard', 'heat', 'radio', 'play', 'movie', 'song', 'day', 'celebrate', 'oscar', 'grown', 'since', 'one', 'reviewer', 'hugely', 'keen', 'fixer', 'upper', 'song', 'perform', 'troll', 'personally', 'found', 'funniest', 'song', 'film', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'primarily', 'sung', 'young', 'anna', 'sweet', 'also', 'like', 'acapella', 'opening', 'music', 'score', 'quite', 'memorable', 'moment', 'beauty', 'tension', 'although', 'become', 'memorable', 'since', 'purchase', 'soundtrack', 'cd', 'film', 'quite', 'fast', 'pace', 'story', 'dialogue', 'dramatic', 'odd', 'heartwarming', 'funny', 'moment', 'happy', 'end', 'use', 'bit', 'animation', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'olaf', 'voice', 'act', 'exceptional', 'particularly', 'kristen', 'bell', 'anna', 'idina', 'menzel', 'nancy', 'tremaine', 'enchant', 'elsa', 'overall', 'film', 'quite', 'impress', 'much', 'tangle', 'due', 'similarity', 'worth', 'watch', 'thanks', 'story', 'music', 'visuals', 'round', 'imdb', 'rating']","[59, 16, 3, 98, 157, 1773, 394, 229, 32, 961, 182, 265, 85, 45, 181, 1095, 9, 1169, 364, 151, 883, 190, 394, 22, 307, 157, 543, 495, 1600, 1812, 394, 27, 17, 9, 213, 1508, 15, 349, 817, 723, 3, 31, 1038, 85, 691, 4306, 7, 23, 3, 2512, 982, 970, 197, 773, 392, 452, 536, 12, 267, 58, 155, 563, 401, 446, 83, 536, 7, 4, 753, 446, 1377, 527, 1015, 66, 9, 2548, 181, 9, 7, 4987, 844, 209, 1452, 4, 1193, 9, 527, 169, 796, 844, 723, 77, 66, 48, 446, 83, 1736, 83, 3, 61, 503, 443, 21, 17, 83, 352, 379, 399, 194, 3, 315, 267, 93, 556, 1613, 1452, 7, 4, 67, 66, 265, 70, 2453, 316, 278, 298, 225, 622, 11, 36, 20, 287, 6, 318, 478, 30, 13, 9, 11, 31, 160, 259, 95, 9, 357, 1601, 2421, 204, 1, 11, 138, 1728, 302, 1107, 98, 10, 1198, 2671, 2744, 772, 737, 11, 1332, 123, 520, 231, 1526, 11, 3, 59, 202, 45, 2013, 684, 73, 7, 457, 27, 9, 631, 58, 223, 124, 268, 133, 149, 1214, 255, 179, 268, 98, 1973, 225, 2008, 3, 124, 780, 564, 12, 719, 1213, 1258, 803, 85, 133, 301, 41, 158, 95, 21, 1773, 394, 32, 86, 112, 1846, 536, 162, 146, 7, 141, 116, 4864, 615, 4, 166, 3, 124, 1433, 31, 83, 404, 1736, 254, 23, 1182, 12, 58, 267, 911, 866, 437]"
779,8,"Disney's animation department has really been struggling over the past decade trying to figure out their place in the midst of in-house rival Pixar, and other studios like Dreamworks Animation. They've been trying to make all of their films a little bit more hip and cool, and less old-fashioned. Now, with Frozen, even thought it's a return to the fairy tale musicals of the past, it's still a little too modern in its sensibilities for it to ever feel like a classic Disney animation.The film is a loose adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale, The Snow Queen. In the film there are two princesses, Elsa and her little sister, Anna. Elsa has always had the ability to create ice and snow, with no way to really control it. When Elsa is crowned queen, she accidentally reveals her powers at the coronation ceremony and freezes the entire kingdom. With Elsa fleeing into the wilderness, Anna must go after her sister to try and thaw the kingdom and help her sister control her abilities. Of course, along the way Anna meets up with a colorful cast of characters, most notably a talking snowman named Olaf who dreams of Summer, and who also gets the biggest laughs of the entire film.Truthfully, there are many things to love about Frozen, I mean the characters are all immediately likable, and I appreciate Disney's attempts at upending all of the traditional tropes that they've harbored in the past to be more feministic, but at a certain point I want that old Disney comfort food. Personally, I miss the simplicity of many of Disney's old animated classics. There was nothing ironic about them, they were not trying to be politically correct, they just were faithfully told fairy tales that made you believe in magic and in the good that the world can offer if we just look for it. Then there is the CG animation, which is very well done, but it lacks the warmth and personality that comes from hand-drawn animation of yore, which I feel would have given the film more life. As well, Frozen often suffers from its attempts to go against the grain. There is not a very strong central conflict to this film, because there is no real villain till about the final twenty minutes, and so the film often feels like its languishing with no urgency, especially in the middle portions. Of course, that's not to say that Frozen is not a good time.The songs of Frozen are the best songs written for a Disney film since the Nineties, with many of the tunes, like ""For the First Time in Forever"" and ""Let It Go,"" assured to be Disney classics, but the film itself falls just shy of that mark. This film does no harm, and it is quite entertaining, but it's one of those movies that a year from now I will be hard pressed to remember. It's definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of Disney animation, but just enough of the classic elements are missing to keep this from being another Disney classic.I give Frozen an 8 out of 10!","['disney', 'animation', 'department', 'really', 'struggle', 'past', 'decade', 'try', 'figure', 'place', 'midst', 'house', 'rival', 'pixar', 'studio', 'like', 'dreamworks', 'animation', 'try', 'make', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'hip', 'cool', 'less', 'old', 'fashion', 'frozen', 'even', 'thought', 'return', 'fairy', 'tale', 'musical', 'past', 'still', 'little', 'modern', 'sensibility', 'ever', 'feel', 'like', 'classic', 'disney', 'animation', 'film', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'fairy', 'tale', 'snow', 'queen', 'film', 'two', 'princess', 'elsa', 'little', 'sister', 'anna', 'elsa', 'always', 'ability', 'create', 'ice', 'snow', 'way', 'really', 'control', 'elsa', 'crown', 'queen', 'accidentally', 'reveals', 'power', 'coronation', 'ceremony', 'freeze', 'entire', 'kingdom', 'elsa', 'flee', 'wilderness', 'anna', 'must', 'go', 'sister', 'try', 'thaw', 'kingdom', 'help', 'sister', 'control', 'ability', 'course', 'along', 'way', 'anna', 'meet', 'colorful', 'cast', 'character', 'notably', 'talk', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'dream', 'summer', 'also', 'get', 'big', 'laugh', 'entire', 'film', 'truthfully', 'many', 'thing', 'love', 'frozen', 'mean', 'character', 'immediately', 'likable', 'appreciate', 'disney', 'attempt', 'upend', 'traditional', 'trope', 'harbor', 'past', 'feministic', 'certain', 'point', 'want', 'old', 'disney', 'comfort', 'food', 'personally', 'miss', 'simplicity', 'many', 'disney', 'old', 'animate', 'classic', 'nothing', 'ironic', 'try', 'politically', 'correct', 'faithfully', 'told', 'fairy', 'tale', 'make', 'believe', 'magic', 'good', 'world', 'offer', 'look', 'cg', 'animation', 'well', 'lack', 'warmth', 'personality', 'come', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'yore', 'feel', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'life', 'well', 'frozen', 'often', 'suffers', 'attempt', 'go', 'grain', 'strong', 'central', 'conflict', 'film', 'real', 'villain', 'till', 'final', 'twenty', 'minute', 'film', 'often', 'feel', 'like', 'languish', 'urgency', 'especially', 'middle', 'portion', 'course', 'say', 'frozen', 'good', 'time', 'song', 'frozen', 'best', 'song', 'write', 'disney', 'film', 'since', 'ninety', 'many', 'tune', 'like', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'let', 'go', 'assure', 'disney', 'classic', 'film', 'fall', 'shy', 'mark', 'film', 'harm', 'quite', 'entertain', 'one', 'movie', 'year', 'hard', 'press', 'remember', 'definitely', 'worth', 'see', 'fan', 'disney', 'animation', 'enough', 'classic', 'element', 'miss', 'keep', 'another', 'disney', 'classic', 'give', 'frozen']","[2, 21, 1755, 22, 639, 276, 492, 87, 630, 188, 4988, 899, 1487, 194, 311, 9, 1035, 21, 87, 14, 3, 48, 95, 2943, 556, 321, 64, 974, 5, 28, 92, 385, 219, 114, 51, 276, 68, 48, 324, 2876, 81, 53, 9, 69, 2, 21, 3, 937, 891, 44, 245, 467, 219, 114, 39, 49, 3, 42, 29, 4, 48, 15, 7, 4, 163, 367, 134, 33, 39, 50, 22, 128, 4, 722, 49, 300, 1424, 24, 343, 1851, 282, 264, 77, 4, 1454, 1752, 7, 236, 13, 15, 87, 775, 77, 135, 15, 128, 367, 228, 172, 50, 7, 244, 1427, 227, 8, 2323, 178, 45, 183, 32, 626, 205, 27, 19, 106, 190, 264, 3, 61, 43, 6, 5, 218, 8, 597, 402, 699, 2, 448, 462, 1032, 4989, 276, 563, 117, 59, 64, 2, 2098, 520, 271, 3224, 61, 2, 64, 38, 69, 156, 1992, 87, 2567, 1462, 511, 219, 114, 14, 220, 150, 17, 126, 705, 66, 1303, 21, 18, 273, 1324, 407, 40, 323, 747, 21, 4325, 53, 26, 57, 3, 79, 18, 5, 583, 2369, 448, 13, 4680, 167, 1061, 552, 3, 195, 104, 1087, 817, 1393, 211, 3, 583, 53, 9, 4452, 121, 962, 2073, 228, 35, 5, 17, 20, 11, 5, 34, 11, 165, 2, 3, 98, 4990, 61, 804, 9, 36, 20, 287, 30, 13, 3209, 2, 69, 3, 186, 2897, 820, 3, 709, 124, 243, 10, 1, 47, 307, 2628, 391, 174, 254, 16, 176, 2, 21, 164, 69, 401, 271, 154, 102, 2, 69, 57, 5]"
780,2,"Mildly interesting plot with far too many ordinary songs that seem to go on way too long. Typical Disney formula of showing happy times, then some sort of disaster, then the protagonists struggling to make things better and then everything magically becomes fantastic and we're all relieved.

782,10,"""Frozen"" was a pleasant surprise for me: I was a bit skeptical about it at first after seeing the previews (Which gave me the impression that this movie was just a repetition of the ""Tangled"" formula in a different setting) Fortunately, ""Frozen"" surpassed all my expectations, being very close to the spirit of Disney classics from the nineties (such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"") but with a couple of interesting twists which subvert many of common tropes associated with the animated films from this studio.The visual aspect of ""Frozen"" is excellent, with spectacular sceneries and very appealing character designs. While I'm not the greatest fan of musicals, I have to admit that the songs were quite effective and nice to hear.I liked the way in which the main characters at first sight seem to be like the typical figures from fairy tales, but the movies gives them more depth and charm in order to portray those archetypes in a different perspective. And despite my initial doubts, Olaf turned out to be a convincing comic-relief, being much less annoying that I was expecting.Considering how disappointing the 2013 was for animation, I think that ""Frozen"" could easily earn the title of the very best of the year, above the enjoyable ""Monsters University"" and the more than decent ""The Croods"".

First we do started of with some past of Anna and Elsa's life and yes there it is with some clichés from other movies such as the trolls and et cetera erasing Anna's memory and with that.Then another cliché in which the parents die and they were forced to take responsibility of the whole kingdom and then the huge fight between Anna and Elsa which has one of the worst dialog of animation history.Elsa runs away and does nothing much to do anything with it while Anna tries to find her sister and along the way,she meets another man while being in the love triangle and also come across a talking snowman(another cliché thing) while trying to find her sister.And throughout the climax of the story,we realized that the villain is an unexpected villain which really yes,he is quite a good villain,I mean Hans,who wants to kill both of them,so instead of fighting back like killing him,they lock him out in prison and they lived happily ever after,which is also one of the worst ending in animation history,because its about Elsa's fault of not being able to control her powers and she could have done by logic sense to control her power. Sigh Well,this movie is perfectly terrible for a movie,horrible character development,rip offs,horrible endings and also a bad script,plus their music is so annoying so as their characters which are generally unlikable.Forgive me if I've used such words but this is the WORST Disney MOVIE and the biggest joke from Disney since Chicken Little (2005) ,period.Even by Disney's most so called weakest movie ,Meet The Robinsons(2007) (which is by far one of Disney's strongest animated films ) could hold better by a realistic plot,a realistic and likable characters and also a realistic villain whom I can relate too,with the inspiring Keep Moving Forward quote by Walt Disney himself.Well also I'll like to put it here that I've never walked out of the theater so angrily in my life,I was so shocked and angry of the quality of the movie that I've seen that I've felt so mixed after this movie.Well here is a warning ,DON""T watch the movie.Don't even see the ratings and the reviews,they were all bias actually,and don't let your future generation suffer with a movie like Frozen,it should be a movie that should be forgotten one day.You might go watch The Incredibles (2004) instead.

785,3,"Before I go into this review, I'm just going to say: I hate Frozen. For three years, kids have been constantly buying their merchandise, singing their songs and rejoicing that it is the best film ever. And it's not always just the kids. I can understand why Frozen is liked by many, but at the same time I can't. How can a film last for three years. I will first talk about the story, the character development, the music, the presentation and my point of view on how the film is so successful and 'good'.The plot is very bland and it's all over the place. To have a good successful film you need a great plot, something that this film doesn't have. There seems to be no character development in the plot either, but we'll get to that soon. The climax is so weak and the main villain is the good guy cliché is strong in this. However, the story isn't the worst thing about this film...The characters are so two dimensional. Elsa has nothing promising about her character apart from her ice powers. By 'conceal', I think she means hold back the character development.. Anna is just a clumsy princess with a fun and energetic nature. I've heard that one about 20 times... Olaf is just placed in the film for the sake of comedy. He's just a character that's there to attempt to make the film funny, but it just makes the film cringe worthy. The other characters are empty shells just there for the sake of making the film a bit more crowded.The music is quite forgettable and bland. When people talk about the soundtrack being good, they're only talking about 'Let it go'. This song has been overplayed, overpraised and it is overrated. The lyrics are terrible and the chorus is lazy.If I can praise this film for anything, it's the animation. The animation is great and vibrant. The character designs are decent and the backgrounds and effects are high quality, and you can tell that they spent all their effort on the presentation. Probably explains the lack of effort on the other categories.This is not only my opinion, but mostly true on why the film is still popular: the children. This film was made for children. But why? Steven Universe, Adventure Time and other kids shows have good plot, animation and music, and they're for children, so what is this films excuse? Adults even enjoy some kid shows. The children encourage businesses to feed off their excitement. Overdosing on toys, songs and spin offs. There's probably even going to be a sequel that's even worse than before, with even more bland characters and long lasting music. I'm afraid of what kids films have come too. Disney.

786,10,"After watching Tangled and being slightly underwhelmed I was slightly sceptical when I heard about this film. I thought it was going to be really cheesy and childish. But I was wrong.The reason this film is so great is because it can appeal to a wider audience. The film begins on a slightly gloomy note after Anna and Elsa's parents i.e the King and Queen are killed in an accident and after seeing this I knew it wasn't all going to be all laughs and giggles. It shows how Anna and Elsa have barely any contact and how it is affecting them and I really enjoyed how this is portrayed. Later, Anna meets Prince Hans who is a really nice guy and I thought to myself 'Oh no', this guy seems too nice and I thought that he was going to be one of the main protagonists. However, towards the end of the film we discover that he is actually the antagonist which really came to a shock to me and my friends. The most appealing thing about this film and one of the things that stood out to me the most when i watched it was the soundtrack.

787,1,"Were the judges paid off? Why did this movie win? I'm so baffled, especially of Miyazaki. Most of the reviews have explained why this movie is so terrible like terrible plot, inconsistencies, no explanation or reasoning behind the characters motivations, and the overall lack of character depth. But I'm going to rant on specifically about Elsa and why she's such a terrible character. **Spoilers ahead, but seriously, watching this movie is a waste of time*Elsa is the most selfish character that Disney has ever created (at least as far as protagonists go). I understand she's been put through a lot by having these unexplained powers and the random but horrible death of her parents. But her poor sister, Anna, has to endure all that pain on her own. Her sister won't even talk to her or cry with her. And then, comes coronation day, which apparently means Elsa will have to finally not only confront her sister, but the entire town, which really doesn't seem to difficult for her (like she really has been locked up all this time). 1) So why doesn't Anna hate her selfish sister who was never there for her? Anna's been through a lot on her own, so shouldn't that make her stronger, less dependent on her sister. There's no reason behind her running after her sister when her sister has never been there for her.2) Elsa refuses to let Anna marry a guy she's fallen in love with. Granted, this is never a good idea, but why would Elsa even be against it since she doesn't seem to care about her sister's feelings anyway? Again, this just shows how Elsa is self absorbed.3) Elsa selfishly runs away from her own problems. Then she proceeds to build herself an ice castle and sings a song about how she only needs herself. She seems pretty happy and doesn't even wonder why the town has frozen over. She seems content in her own little world. But when her unselfish sister comes to save her, she throws her out, tossing her aside and choosing her solitude over her own sister. (And I think she injuries her sister again... can't remember). 4) And finally when Elsa can't possibly get any worse, she gets upset and starts a crazy storm without any regard to those around her. She only cares for herself, only thinks about her own anger because that's the only thing that matters to her in that moment. She could care less if everyone else freezes. And then again her selfless sister comes and saves her, even risking her life for her selfish sister who has never treated her kindly since they were kids. If Elsa is the kind of princess or role model Disney is trying to set for kids, I weep for that generation. Disney, because you seem to lack any creativity, any original plot with strong, relatable characters, here are a few suggestions for you:--A princess who is in love with another princess (yes, Disney, it's time to step outside the box). --A princess with real curves, with a realistic shape. Imagine what this would teach kids. Yes at any shape or size, everyone can be a princess. --A storyline without falling in love. You managed to do it with Up, so I think you can do it again. --If you are going to go the magical route, make it fantastical, a fantasy where the sky's the limit (take some pointers from Hayao Miyazaki).I hope this is enough for you to get started, Disney. Please don't ever disappoint me again, or I will have to call you and bang my ideas over your head.","['judge', 'paid', 'movie', 'win', 'baffle', 'especially', 'miyazaki', 'review', 'explain', 'movie', 'terrible', 'like', 'terrible', 'plot', 'inconsistency', 'explanation', 'reason', 'behind', 'character', 'motivation', 'overall', 'lack', 'character', 'depth', 'go', 'rant', 'specifically', 'elsa', 'terrible', 'character', 'spoiler', 'ahead', 'seriously', 'watch', 'movie', 'waste', 'time', 'elsa', 'selfish', 'character', 'disney', 'ever', 'create', 'least', 'far', 'protagonist', 'go', 'understand', 'put', 'lot', 'unexplained', 'power', 'random', 'horrible', 'death', 'parent', 'poor', 'sister', 'anna', 'endure', 'pain', 'sister', 'even', 'talk', 'cry', 'come', 'coronation', 'day', 'apparently', 'mean', 'elsa', 'finally', 'confront', 'sister', 'entire', 'town', 'really', 'seem', 'difficult', 'like', 'really', 'lock', 'time', 'anna', 'hate', 'selfish', 'sister', 'never', 'anna', 'lot', 'make', 'strong', 'less', 'dependent', 'sister', 'reason', 'behind', 'run', 'sister', 'sister', 'never', 'elsa', 'refuse', 'let', 'anna', 'marry', 'guy', 'fall', 'love', 'grant', 'never', 'good', 'idea', 'would', 'elsa', 'even', 'since', 'seem', 'care', 'sister', 'feeling', 'anyway', 'show', 'elsa', 'self', 'absorbed', 'elsa', 'selfishly', 'run', 'away', 'problem', 'proceeds', 'build', 'ice', 'castle', 'sings', 'song', 'need', 'seem', 'pretty', 'happy', 'even', 'wonder', 'town', 'frozen', 'seem', 'content', 'little', 'world', 'unselfish', 'sister', 'come', 'save', 'throw', 'toss', 'aside', 'choose', 'solitude', 'sister', 'think', 'injury', 'sister', 'remember', 'finally', 'elsa', 'possibly', 'get', 'bad', 'get', 'upset', 'start', 'crazy', 'storm', 'without', 'regard', 'around', 'care', 'think', 'anger', 'thing', 'matter', 'moment', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'everyone', 'else', 'freeze', 'selfless', 'sister', 'come', 'save', 'even', 'risk', 'life', 'selfish', 'sister', 'never', 'treat', 'kindly', 'since', 'kid', 'elsa', 'kind', 'princess', 'role', 'model', 'disney', 'try', 'set', 'kid', 'weep', 'generation', 'disney', 'seem', 'lack', 'creativity', 'original', 'plot', 'strong', 'relatable', 'character', 'suggestion', 'princess', 'love', 'another', 'princess', 'yes', 'disney', 'time', 'step', 'outside', 'box', 'princess', 'real', 'curve', 'realistic', 'shape', 'imagine', 'would', 'teach', 'kid', 'yes', 'shape', 'size', 'everyone', 'princess', 'storyline', 'without', 'fall', 'love', 'manage', 'think', 'go', 'go', 'magical', 'route', 'make', 'fantastical', 'fantasy', 'sky', 'limit', 'take', 'pointer', 'hayao', 'miyazaki', 'hope', 'enough', 'get', 'start', 'disney', 'please', 'ever', 'disappoint', 'call', 'bang', 'idea', 'head']","[1592, 1843, 1, 374, 2610, 121, 1681, 161, 400, 1, 432, 9, 432, 52, 2134, 806, 180, 750, 8, 2035, 166, 273, 8, 609, 13, 2865, 1828, 4, 432, 8, 419, 1270, 667, 23, 1, 644, 20, 4, 1558, 8, 2, 81, 134, 250, 142, 354, 13, 216, 196, 84, 1401, 24, 1180, 896, 517, 118, 973, 15, 7, 2006, 1765, 15, 28, 178, 505, 40, 343, 138, 755, 218, 4, 241, 2648, 15, 264, 602, 22, 75, 1113, 9, 22, 382, 20, 7, 333, 1558, 15, 88, 7, 84, 14, 167, 321, 2776, 15, 180, 750, 233, 15, 15, 88, 4, 1383, 30, 7, 390, 148, 186, 6, 1865, 88, 17, 281, 26, 4, 28, 98, 75, 293, 15, 680, 497, 78, 4, 429, 3567, 4, 4894, 233, 101, 198, 3005, 202, 33, 168, 794, 11, 99, 75, 136, 301, 28, 532, 602, 5, 75, 1370, 48, 126, 15, 40, 111, 744, 3132, 716, 1672, 1440, 15, 37, 2732, 15, 391, 241, 4, 842, 19, 65, 19, 1320, 120, 1008, 713, 137, 902, 200, 293, 37, 1898, 43, 375, 133, 54, 293, 321, 109, 270, 282, 1945, 15, 40, 111, 28, 1386, 79, 1558, 15, 88, 682, 4936, 98, 60, 4, 193, 29, 371, 753, 2, 87, 144, 60, 616, 2, 75, 273, 2824, 230, 52, 167, 884, 8, 3573, 29, 6, 102, 29, 325, 2, 20, 668, 769, 598, 29, 195, 3316, 640, 1317, 1137, 26, 621, 60, 325, 1317, 4542, 109, 29, 295, 137, 186, 6, 857, 37, 13, 13, 170, 1650, 14, 3645, 545, 1395, 2285, 55, 4994, 3920, 1681, 384, 164, 19, 120, 2, 576, 81, 808, 308, 4141, 281, 317]"

790,10,"Most unexpectedly, Disney's ""Frozen"" (hereafter ""D's Frozen"") subtly reconfigures and directs the seemingly tiresome tropes and conventions of their romantic ""princess movies"" into uncharted ""Marvel comic"" territory and themes. The main protagonist (AND apparently antagonist) Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) is far more than your run-of-the-mill glamorous elder princess, then (Snow) Queen of the kingdom of Arondelle. She possesses nearly unlimited, almost magical power to control and shape ice and snow.In a Marvel comic, she'd be considered a mutant with the combined powers of Ice-Man and Storm. Unfortunately and tragically, she lives in medieval times and does not have the guidance of a Charles Xavier-like mentor to help her harness the power for mankind's benefit. Well, there IS a (literally) stone troll king, Grand Pabbie (voice of Ciaran Hinds) who is aware of the extent of Elsa's powers. However, all he can recommend to Elsa's father (voice of Maurice LaMarche) and mother (voice of Jennifer Lee), King and Queen of Arendelle, is cruel, complete isolation from all humanity until she is mature enough to ascend the Arondelle throne.Part of the reason Elsa is held in quarantine is because in childhood, while using her powers to create a winter playground for herself and younger sister Princess Anna (adult voice of Kristen Bell), she accidentally injured her head. Although non-superpowered and ""normal"", Anna heals with the Troll King's help. Having no memory of the incident, Anna is distraught and perplexed as to why Elsa cannot come out to play. Still, the coronation day comes, and Elsa seems to be in emotional control of herself and her abilities. Not for long. Elsa gets upset when beautiful but impulsive Anna immediately intends to get hitched to comely Southern Isles prince Hans (voice of Santino Fontana), a guy she met only minutes before in a boating ""mishap"". Already tense and anxious, Elsa unleashes an ice age on Arondelle and flees the shocked citizenry for the lonely refuge of the mountains.Anna may be a mere mortal, and a bit clumsy, but she is unswervingly determined to locate and reconcile with her sister and convince her to thaw out the kingdom. This sounds like a straight-arrow objective, but many complications come into play. One, Elsa finally finds peace and the freedom to be herself in the mountains, which is celebrated in the ubiquitous, destined-to-be ageless ballad ""Let It Go"", and literally carves out an ice palace for herself. Two, although Anna teams up with loner ice-delivery man Kristoff (voice of Jonathan Groff) and his faithful, dog-like reindeer Sven, and a wacky snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad), they at first don't seem to be much help. Kristoff, like Elsa, just wants to be left alone, and Olaf keeps falling apart and foolishly wishing he could move to the tropics. But, with Sven's urging, Anna's tenacity and persistence bring this odd duo around. Third, some in the coronation party, like the Duke of Weselton ('Weaselton"") voice of Alan Tudyk) and others, consider Elsa a monster and want to eliminate her. Fourth, Elsa accidentally causes Anna to suffer a ""heart freeze"" that could prove fatal. Can Anna achieve this miracle and save both Elsa and herself? According to the Troll King, true love is the key. But what is this true love?""D's Frozen"" continues the Mouse House's rise above older cartoon sentiments and happily- ever-after resolutions and marriages (mostly) and explores more advanced, modern emotions and themes. In Marvel Comics ""X-men"", mutants deal with adolescent anxiety and confusion about their powers, their fear of losing control of their powers and causing death and destruction, and the prejudicial hostility of a society that can't and won't understand them. Elsa faces these same dilemmas. ""D's Frozen"" moves beyond superficial, helpless romantic puppy love (like that of Anna and Hans) into more substantial love and friendship like the one within a family and between sisters. It also moves beyond conventional villains (although there are a few, and at least one unanticipated one) to show that our own worst enemies are our inhibitions and fears. ""D's Frozen"" also continues the relatively recent Disney movement to create independent, self-assured women who do not automatically need men to face and overcome danger and obstacles. And naturally, most importantly, ""D's Frozen"" helps us figure out what that true love is, with, amazingly, the help of that ""wise fool"" Olaf. True love is captured in the phrase that begins, ""No greater love hath a man (person) for another than to."".Best of all, ""D's Frozen"" achieves the weighty themes mentioned above with excellent visually artistry, suspenseful and sometimes heart-thumping action, naturally funny slapstick and verbal humor, dazzling musical numbers, satisfying character development, and happiness that is not dependent upon a ""deus ex machina"", but hard-won. Not bad for this Disney/Marvel collaboration. Not bad at all.P.S.: If you have the patience to wade through the end credits, you'll find a funny disclaimer addressing Kristoff's opinion about men and their noses, and the final fate of the abominable snowman Elsa creates to protect herself from attack.","['unexpectedly', 'disney', 'frozen', 'hereafter', 'frozen', 'subtly', 'reconfigures', 'directs', 'seemingly', 'tiresome', 'trope',

791,8,"Count me pleasantly surprised: this is probably Disney's best since Aladdin (not counting Pixar, which is in a league of its own).There is much to appreciate, including likable performances by Bell and company, memorable characters, a catchy main song. Still, what elevates Frozen is the script by Jennifer Lee. It's not exactly groundbreaking, but it has a subversive streak which I found refreshing, featuring two strong female protagonists (where ""strong"" doesn't mean ""acting like a man"", marking this as the first truly feminist Disney film) and a clever deconstruction of narrative tropes such as love at first sight and Prince Charming-like figures. One could argue the first two Shrek movies took a shot at those ten years ago, but the lack of cynicism here makes it even more effective.Even more surprisingly, what defeats the curse is not romantic love but a selfless act of brotherly (er, sisterly) affection, deflecting in the process another typical Disney cliché - how, for all the cutesy and feel-good atmosphere of their narrative, conflicts are invariably solved with violence and murder, as villains meet a gruesome demise, usually thrown from great heights.And seriously, how can you not like a magic snowman who yearns for a warm summer day and is naively oblivious to the consequences? 8/10","['count', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'probably', 'disney', 'best', 'since', 'aladdin', 'counting', 'pixar', 'league', 'much', 'appreciate', 'include', 'likable', 'performance', 'bell', 'company', 'memorable', 'character', 'catchy', 'main', 'song', 'still', 'elevates', 'frozen', 'script', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'exactly', 'groundbreaking', 'subversive', 'streak', 'found', 'refresh', 'feature', 'two', 'strong', 'female', 'protagonist', 'strong', 'mean', 'act', 'like', 'man', 'mark', 'first', 'truly', 'feminist', 'disney', 'film', 'clever', 'deconstruction', 'narrative', 'trope', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'prince', 'charm', 'like', 'figure', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'first', 'two', 'shrek', 'movie', 'take', 'shot', 'ten', 'year', 'ago', 'lack', 'cynicism', 'make', 'even', 'effective', 'even', 'surprisingly', 'defeat', 'curse', 'romantic', 'love', 'selfless', 'act', 'brotherly', 'er', 'sisterly', 'affection', 'deflect', 'process', 'another', 'typical', 'disney', 'clich', 'cutesy', 'feel', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'narrative', 'conflict', 'invariably', 'solve', 'violence', 'murder', 'villain', 'meet', 'gruesome', 'demise', 'usually', 'thrown', 'great', 'height', 'seriously', 'like', 'magic', 'snowman', 'yearns', 'warm', 'summer', 'day', 'naively', 'oblivious', 'consequence']","[1430, 1633, 703, 210, 2, 34, 98, 485, 2640, 194, 2592, 31, 699, 349, 402, 493, 146, 789, 268, 8, 266, 119, 11, 68, 5, 395, 464, 416, 522, 1546, 3737, 2271, 231, 1010, 229, 42, 167, 237, 354, 167, 218, 112, 9, 145, 820, 36, 329, 720, 2, 3, 691, 4461, 802, 1032, 6, 36, 675, 82, 235, 9, 630, 10, 54, 1247, 36, 42, 1208, 1, 55, 1103, 829, 47, 683, 273, 4688, 14, 28, 1363, 28, 1179, 2294, 405, 393, 6, 1945, 112, 5007, 3291, 711, 1333, 1097, 102, 376, 2, 274, 3259, 53, 17, 1380, 802, 552, 4728, 1684, 2994, 2544, 104, 244, 3923, 460, 1121, 25, 2118, 667, 9, 150, 45, 3427, 362, 205, 138, 3783, 2758, 1560]"

I especially liked how Elsa was in trouble, but then she was looking into Anna's face as she saved her.

794,10,"Elsa (Eva Bella, Idina Menzel) is the future queen of Arendelle, a fictional Scandinavian kingdom. Elsa has the power to turn everything into ice. She freezes her sister Anna's (Libby Steubenrauch) head as a child, and almost kills her. Anna is saved by a troll, who also removes all memories of Elsa's special power. Elsa's parents lock Elsa in her room for reasons Anna no longer understands, and Elsa becomes afraid of her powers and feels like she has to hide them, and hide herself, which causes Elsa a lot of stress. At her coronation, all the doors of the castle are thrown open and Elsa has been made queen, but Anna has news over her own, she is going to marry Prince Hans. (Santino Fortana) This announcement is too much for Elsa, doesn't want anyone else to find out her secret, Elsa also feels that Anna is rushing into a marriage, when she doesn't really understand. Under duress, Elsa can't control her powers and turns Arendelle into a place with a perpetual winter. Unable to cope with the results of her unfettered powers, Elsa runs off to North Mountain and builds a castle from ice. Anna is convinced that she can bring Elsa back from the North Mountain and stop the perpetual winter plaguing Arendelle. With the help of a mountaineer named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and a magical snowman named Olaf, (Josh Gad) who Elsa created as a child, Anna tries to convince Elsa that she belongs in Arendelle. But when Anna gets to the castle, Elsa freezes her heart, and only an act of true love can save Anna.Sure, Frozen is a kids movie, there are adorable characters like the trolls (reminiscent of the seven dwarfs) and a snowman called Olaf, but behind the cuteness is a complex story about the meaning of true love, and a pair of self-sufficient princesses, one who uses her powers to defend herself, and one who saves Kristoff from falling down the mountain. The question of what is true love resolves itself in an unexpected way, which reflects the increased sensitivity of Disney writers to the roles of women in today's society. That's a lot of ground for a kids' movie to cover, but Frozen deftly adds touches of humor and music to make it entertaining for both kids and adults alike. The music is outstanding and sets the mood for many scenes as well as propelling the story forward. The animation is amazing, which is the Disney standard, the animation is filled with beauty, the Aurora Borealis is a series of dreamy streaks in the sky, the ice castle is a palace of shimmering beauty.The acting is superb, Idina Menzel, previously only known as a Broadway star, rocketed to fame as the singer of the Academy Award winning song, ""Let It Go."" She has become a household name because of this movie (to everyone except John Travolta) and her fame is well deserved. Her voice soars in ""Let it Go"" and the song is the standout of a very good soundtrack. Menzel also handles a very tough role adroitly, she is the Ice Princess literally and figuratively, she is emotionally detached from her sister, because she thinks that will protect her. Kristen Bell deserves a lot of credit for her under-appreciated role of Anna, she is carefree and loving, and the emotional center of this movie. Bell plays her perfectly, and she also has a superb voice. Jonathan Groff beautifully underplays Kristoff, Josh Gad is full of joy as Olaf, the snowman who ironically loves summer.The movie is a long one, but the pacing is handled so well that the movie never drags. Stunning animation makes the movie visually appealing, and a captivating story will leave everyone happy.For more heartwarming reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.","['elsa', 'eva',

795,8,So at first I did not have any expectation from the movie. The movie released and I said why not I give it a shot. It was much better than I expected. The story is nice. I liked the twist. The best thing I liked was the solid animation. It was just awesome. The perfectly detailed animation. Some songs were nice especially Let It Go. I like that song quiet a lot. Elsa releases her locked up emotions and let her powers flourish. The reason I gave 8 was that there was a song every now and then. They squeezed in a lot of song. That was unnecessary. They say that it is adapted to the book written by Hans Christian Andersan The Snow Queen but it is very loosely adapted.

796,2,"Okay okay, I did have high expectations for this movie because I heard from some people that it's good, so at first I wasn't sure if I disliked it so much because of that. But then I watched it again and now I'm 100% sure that this movie is a pile of unused potential covered in snowy glitter.First off, the pacing of the story is really bad. The whole thing felt unsatisfying and rushed. The romantic subplot was also really cliché. I think there were way too many songs in the movie and it took away from the story.Now about the characters. Lets go over Anna first (cuz she's the princess). I will say it like this, Anna is a mixture of Rapunzel and a wooden plank. Rapunzel they were kinda in similar situations and they have yet to learn about the world outside of their castles, and wooden plank because Anna lacks any interesting character traits. She is kind hearted and wants to feel love. Wow! Great character, keep it up! After Anna there's Elsa. She is scared that her powers would hurt somebody so she isolates herself from others. Oh, and she's kinda paranoid because of that. That's all you need to know about her. Hans is a guy who lives in the mountains with a bunch of rocks. He likes Anna. And the ginger guy (whose name I forgot) is evil and he wants to rule because he has 12 older brothers. So yeah, the characters are kinda bad and they're lack any development whatsoever. As the final verdict, I would only recommend this movie to young children and their moms. It really isn't worth your time if you know how to tell quality from low quality. The only redeemable factor is the animation which looks kinda nice, and it is the only thing that saved this movie from receiving a 1 from me.Oh, and how is this rated the same as Tangled and how did it win 2 Oscars when Leo can't even win one?","['okay', 'okay', 'high', 'expectation', 'movie', 'heard', 'people', 'good', 'first', 'sure', 'disliked', 'much', 'watch', 'sure', 'movie', 'pile', 'unused', 'potential', 'cover', 'snowy', 'glitter', 'first', 'pace', 'story', 'really', 'bad', 'whole', 'thing', 'felt', 'unsatisfying', 'rush', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'also', 'really', 'clich', 'think', 'way', 'many', 'song', 'movie', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'character', 'let', 'go', 'anna', 'first', 'cuz', 'princess', 'say', 'like', 'anna', 'mixture', 'rapunzel', 'wooden', 'plank', 'rapunzel', 'kinda', 'similar', 'situation', 'yet', 'learn', 'world', 'outside', 'castle', 'wooden', 'plank', 'anna', 'lack', 'interest', 'character', 'trait', 'kind', 'hearted', 'want', 'feel', 'love', 'wow', 'great', 'character', 'keep', 'anna', 'elsa', 'scar', 'power', 'would', 'hurt', 'somebody', 'isolates', 'others', 'oh', 'kinda', 'paranoid', 'need', 'know', 'han', 'guy', 'life', 'mountain', 'bunch', 'rock', 'like', 'anna', 'ginger', 'guy', 'whose', 'name', 'forgot', 'evil', 'want', 'rule', 'old', 'brother', 'yeah', 'character', 'kinda', 'bad', 'lack', 'development', 'whatsoever', 'final', 'verdict', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'young', 'child', 'mom', 'really', 'worth', 'time', 'know', 'tell', 'quality', 'low', 'quality', 'redeemable', 'factor', 'animation', 'look', 'kinda', 'nice', 'thing', 'save', 'movie', 'receive', 'oh', 'rat', 'tangle', 'win', 'oscar', 'leo', 'even', 'win', 'one']","[420, 420, 206, 452, 1, 357, 46, 17, 36, 207, 3318, 31, 23, 207, 1, 2589, 685, 712, 1218, 3855, 36, 564, 12, 22, 65, 127, 43, 155, 3900, 525, 393, 2492, 27, 22, 274, 37, 50, 61, 11, 1, 55, 101, 12, 8, 30, 13, 7, 36, 3924, 29, 35, 9, 7, 1804, 527, 2894, 5010, 527, 629, 446, 867, 182, 347, 126, 769, 168, 2894, 5010, 7, 273, 122, 8, 1133, 193, 1329, 59, 53, 6, 926, 25, 8, 154, 7, 4, 878, 24, 26, 305, 1832, 2293, 247, 425, 629, 3085, 99, 56, 44, 148, 79, 214, 1211, 834, 9, 7, 148, 620, 183, 1557, 277, 59, 788, 64, 865, 830, 8, 629, 65, 273, 356, 1978, 817, 3818, 26, 262, 1, 73, 70, 1109, 22, 254, 20, 56, 143, 283, 1023, 283, 945, 21, 66, 629, 192, 43, 111, 1, 852, 425, 1055, 83, 374, 302, 28, 374, 10]"
797,7,"I have seen this movie yesterday in a preview in Vienna, and since there aren't much comments yet on IMDb.com, I would like to share my thoughts.First of all: For the second time (following ""Tangled""), the filmmakers managed to transfer the charm of the old Disney-movies to an up-to-date-CGI-picture. This movie has ""Disney"" written all over it; the technical perfection is remarkable and certainly one level higher than in the ""Ice Age""-movies.""Frozen"" is inspired by H.C. Andersens ""Snow Queen"", in a similar way as Disney's ""Jungle Book"" is inspired by Kipling's book; i.e. there isn't much left of the original story. In the centre of ""Frozen"" there are two sisters, Elsa and Anna, princesses in the small kingdom of Erindell (?). The scenery is inspired by Norway, as we are told on the Disney-homepage, and, as I may add, Finland and perhaps a bit of Switzerland. The time may be somewhere between 1600 and 1800. Anyway, the scenery is gorgeous and done with much love for the detail.The movie starts with an a-capella-choir, mixing Indian and modern style, and after that, we have a work song of guys cutting and storing ice for the summer. And much more singing and dancing will follow. I suppose there hasn't been that much singing in a Disney movie since ""Beauty and the Beast"". For my taste, it's a bit too much, and the songs are not always adequate; but the tunes are catchy, and the songs are quite well done and sung.But now to my main objection: Living in Vienna, and being an avid reader of Sigmund Freud, the plot of ""The Snow Queen"" could have been a great chance to explore the psyche of the main characters much more penetratively than usual. And while Anna is basically the typical, feisty, charming Disney heroine (well done, but nothing new here), it's quite a different story with her sister Elsa. There has hardly ever been such a character in a Disney movie, though there are some parallels to the Beast in ""Beauty and the Beast"". Elsa is born with the gift (or curse?) to produce ice and snow at will, but only her parents and her sister know of that. After nearly killing Anna, when they were about 5, she is traumatised and basically closed away in the castle. Her parents die in a storm; therefore she has to take over as queen, and therefore the coronation is imminent, when Elsa is coming of age. Anna is beaming with joy, since the castle gates are opened again at last, and since she has forgotten that incident with her sister. Elsa, on the other hand, is frightened, because she has big trouble controlling her powers. And of course the coronation ends in a disaster; Elsa flees the castle and leaves Erindell in eternal winter. Of course, Anna will try to find her and to bring her back I won't retell the rest of the plot. Some parts are predictable; others come as a surprise, but I had the impression that the first draft of the script might have been much darker; at least it should have been! There is so much potential in a character like Elsa, traumatised, with powers which are controlled more by her subconsciousness than by the consciousness, disappointed, disillusioned, but at the same time craving for love and affection  There are rudiments of that in Elsa, but there could have been much more! This is also causing problems for the plot: There is one point in the showdown, where everything seems to be too late (again, a bit as in ""Beauty and the Beast""); here I asked myself: How will they resolve this? How will they reach the Happy Ending? Well, the solution comes surprisingly quick and seamless; it's too easy in my opinion, and you might ask yourself: If it was that simple, why all the fuss?One last point: In many Disney movies there are annoying sidekicks, and this one is no exception. Here it's Olaf, the talking snowman. Being an Olaf myself, I felt a bit offended. But, well, I can live this that, and since ""Frozen"" is especially a feast for the eyes (especially in 3D), I will certainly see it again!","['see', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'preview', 'vienna', 'since', 'much', 'comment', 'yet', 'imdb', 'com', 'would', 'like', 'share', 'thought', 'first', 'second', 'time', 'follow', 'tangle', 'filmmaker', 'manage', 'transfer', 'charm', 'old', 'disney', 'movie', 'date', 'cgi', 'picture', 'movie', 'disney', 'write', 'technical', 'perfection', 'remarkable', 'certainly', 'one', 'level', 'high', 'ice', 'age', 'movie', 'frozen', 'inspire', 'h', 'c', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'similar', 'way', 'disney', 'jungle', 'book', 'inspire', 'kipling', 'book', 'e', 'much', 'left', 'original', 'story', 'centre', 'frozen', 'two', 'sister', 'elsa', 'anna', 'princess', 'small', 'kingdom', 'erindell', 'scenery', 'inspire', 'norway', 'told', 'disney', 'homepage', 'may', 'add', 'finland', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'switzerland', 'time', 'may', 'somewhere', 'anyway', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'much', 'love', 'detail', 'movie', 'start', 'capella', 'choir', 'mix', 'indian', 'modern', 'style', 'work', 'song', 'guy', 'cut', 'store', 'ice', 'summer', 'much', 'sing', 'dance', 'follow', 'suppose', 'much', 'sing', 'disney', 'movie', 'since', 'beauty', 'beast', 'taste', 'bit', 'much', 'song', 'always', 'adequate', 'tune', 'catchy', 'song', 'quite', 'well', 'sung', 'main', 'objection', 'living', 'vienna', 'avid', 'reader', 'sigmund', 'freud', 'plot', 'snow', 'queen', 'could', 'great', 'chance', 'explore', 'psyche', 'main', 'character', 'much', 'penetratively', 'usual', 'anna', 'basically', 'typical', 'feisty', 'charm', 'disney', 'heroine', 'well', 'nothing', 'new', 'quite', 'different', 'story', 'sister', 'elsa', 'hardly', 'ever', 'character', 'disney', 'movie', 'though', 'parallel', 'beast', 'beauty', 'beast', 'elsa', 'born', 'gift', 'curse', 'produce', 'ice', 'snow', 'parent', 'sister', 'know', 'nearly', 'kill', 'anna', 'traumatise', 'basically', 'close', 'away', 'castle', 'parent', 'die', 'storm', 'therefore', 'take', 'queen', 'therefore', 'coronation', 'imminent', 'elsa', 'come', 'age', 'anna', 'beam', 'joy', 'since', 'castle', 'gate', 'open', 'last', 'since', 'forgotten', 'incident', 'sister', 'elsa', 'hand', 'frighten', 'big', 'trouble', 'control', 'power', 'course', 'coronation', 'end', 'disaster', 'elsa', 'flees', 'castle', 'leaf', 'erindell', 'eternal', 'winter', 'course', 'anna', 'try', 'find', 'bring', 'back', 'retell', 'rest', 'plot', 'part', 'predictable', 'others', 'come', 'surprise', 'impression', 'first', 'draft', 'script', 'might', 'much', 'darker', 'least', 'much', 'potential', 'character', 'like', 'elsa', 'traumatise', 'power', 'control', 'subconsciousness', 'consciousness', 'disappointed', 'disillusion', 'time', 'crave', 'love', 'affection', 'rudiment', 'elsa', 'could', 'much', 'also', 'cause', 'problem', 'plot', 'one', 'point', 'showdown', 'everything', 'seem', 'late', 'bit', 'beauty', 'beast', 'ask', 'resolve', 'reach', 'happy', 'end', 'well', 'solution', 'come', 'surprisingly', 'quick', 'seamless', 'easy', 'opinion', 'might', 'ask', 'simple', 'fuss', 'one', 'last', 'point', 'many', 'disney', 'movie', 'annoy', 'sidekick', 'one', 'exception', 'olaf', 'talk', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'felt', 'bit', 'offend', 'well', 'live', 'since', 'frozen', 'especially', 'feast', 'eye', 'especially', 'certainly', 'see']","[16, 1, 2519, 1568, 5011, 98, 31, 916, 182, 866, 968, 26, 9, 781, 92, 36, 319, 20, 378, 83, 2403, 857, 4320, 235, 64, 2, 1, 927, 555, 438, 1, 2, 165, 1891, 1642, 1530, 442, 10, 440, 206, 33, 139, 1, 5, 500, 2051, 1781, 339, 39, 49, 446, 50, 2, 1799, 596, 500, 596, 893, 31, 330, 230, 12, 2187, 5, 42, 15, 4, 7, 29, 601, 77, 5012, 1217, 500, 2265, 511, 2, 171, 269, 578, 95, 20, 171, 1867, 497, 1217, 444, 31, 6, 468, 1, 120, 2048, 1119, 4653, 324, 355, 107, 11, 148, 723, 1223, 33, 205, 31, 63, 1067, 378, 473, 31, 63, 2, 1, 98, 149, 203, 1120, 95, 31, 11, 163, 2701, 804, 266, 11, 124, 18, 684, 119, 704, 5011, 3711, 3685, 52, 39, 49, 54, 25, 632, 1423, 2830, 119, 8, 31, 562, 7, 570, 376, 1651, 235, 2, 565, 18, 156, 108, 124, 140, 12, 15, 4, 976, 81, 8, 2, 1, 100, 2239, 203, 149, 203, 4, 589, 832, 405, 587, 33, 39, 118, 15, 56, 501, 286, 7, 5013, 570, 351, 101, 168, 118, 368, 713, 1241, 55, 49, 1241, 343, 4, 40, 139, 7, 5014, 738, 98, 168, 964, 318, 197, 98, 1017, 1093, 15, 4, 323, 1516, 106, 1073, 128, 24, 228, 343, 41, 1783, 4, 710, 168, 586, 5012, 310, 105, 228, 7, 87, 71, 221, 74, 2250, 303, 52, 94, 331, 247, 40, 445, 1118, 36, 2023, 395, 252, 31, 1240, 250, 31, 685, 8, 9, 4, 5013, 24, 128, 3732, 476, 20, 3760, 6, 1333, 4, 54, 31, 27, 328, 198, 52, 10, 117, 132, 75, 530, 95, 149, 203, 581, 1298, 1046, 301, 41, 18, 2450, 40, 1179, 1191, 2668, 454, 258, 252, 581, 516, 2141, 10, 197, 117, 61, 2, 1, 238, 436, 10, 645, 32, 178, 45, 32, 155, 95, 3319, 18, 224, 98, 5, 121, 3268, 336, 121, 442, 16]"

799,10,"People always talk about their favourite Disney movies, the Renaissance and movies from the Golden Age of animation and the Nine Old Men are going to be mentioned. Frozen is beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and a heart warming story for people of all ages.Frozen is absolutely, visually perfect. The technical perfection is remarkable, all the small details that make it beautiful and very nice to look at. Every scene is mind-boggling, in a good way. One of my favourite settings would be the ice palace, it's gorgeous and very stunning, watching the magic happen made me feel like a child again. The Norwegian influences were wonderful and were one with the story. The atmosphere, architecture and organic richness were fascinating. This almost feels like it were a real piece of history. It's worth seeing in 3D (it isn't distracting!)It is an incredibly touching story with fantastic musical numbers, that will have you singing along, or humming if you are afraid to share your voice with the world. The score is magnificent, the texture, the harmony and the melody flow effortlessly and is a character in itself. The performance by the always excellent Kristen Bell was a true asset to this film, as well as the rest of the voice cast.Elsa is an excellently executed character, a quasi-Beast character who is extremely fascinating and a focal point, the main plot advancer. It focuses on not only her originality, but also the relationship of two sisters. The sidekick Olaf I thought I'd strongly dislike, due to his animation and his weird shape (aren't snowmen supposed to be round?) but I found that Josh Gad had brought to life this humorous snowman. All the children (and some adults) were laughing hysterically at him and he also ended up being a major character toward the end. This has the charm of the old Disney classics, but puts a new spin on the story between a princess and a prince.It felt new and as fresh as a new blanket of snow but nostalgic as well. I feel like it took me back to my years as a child, where I'd dance and sing along to all my favourite classics.

The fairy tale, the happily ever after prince & princess story etc. never gets old. With the wonderful music(OMG,Seriously, I will definitely buy the soundtrack and won't stop playing it until it gets burned up), the story looks way more brighter even deep down its just an typical lion king like storyline. However it's totally worth it and an joyful one and a half hour. Fantastic musical, well written and animated. And of course the soundtrack. I bet Disney spent most of time on composing them and made them flawless. Frozen is a solid movie in general however it can be more well developed.

802,8,"Frozen is a unique film which strikes right to the feelings. The characters are lovable and memorable and their relationships feel so real. It also featured new mechanics in animation.Even though it may first seem even a bit boring for having too much musical parts at first, it turns out to be great and little bit dramatic and takes the viewer with. But after few minutes it didn't get boring anymore because it had short and funny sketches to lighten up the atmosphere. It doesn't have very intense plot but the characters, their relationships and events happening between them make the bigger part in entertaining the viewer. It became interesting. It became fascination. What is going to happen next? It's like some kind of force that drags me towards the characters' world and silently forces to like them. Disney took a relatively big risk for making a musical animation instead of regular themed. Also the story telling and events happen much faster than usual. They really could have slowed down a bit and make the movie also a little bit longer. The songs sung and music could also been little bit better. Soundtrack wasn't impressive at all; in some parts it actually felt nonexistent and you had to imagine a better music for that. Or then I'm just spoiled by other good composers I've gotten used to.All in all, Frozen is a very good movie which takes the viewer with it and keeps him/her in front of the screen/monitor/whatever for the whole movie.

The best thing I can say about it is that the animation is fluid and seamless, but that counts for little when the CGI characters are so empty and lacking in character, with huge eyes that express absolutely nothing.The story is a hodge-podge of bits stolen from other movies, most notably the comedy reindeer and snowman who fulfil the same purpose as Eddie Murphy's donkey in SHREK. The back story is brief and hardly enough to propel the main thrust of a narrative, leaving big empty chunks in the film's progress.The characters are hopelessly self-centred and the voice actors give typically grating, over the top vocal performances.

806,8,"So, we watched Frozen recently, and I just have to write a review about it!!Ken and I had some mixed feelings about this film. While it was good overall, I was kinda bummed about some aspects of it.The good:--Most of the music. ""Let It Go"" is an epic song, and Olaf's song is hilarious!--Olaf!! He is HILARIOUS!! I adore his character, and his lines were epic :)--Kristoff's conversations with Sven - I do that all the time with my pets, and it was awesome and laugh-out-loud hilarious to see it in a movie!The disappointing:--Hans. I mean, really?? I did not see that coming. I also did not like that twist.--Elsa being the ""I don't need a man"" kind of woman. I loved the direction it was going when there were two guys and two girls - each girl gets to be with someone who loves them, and are able to be sisters again.The bad:--Nothing!! I didn't find anything bad with this movie. It's awesome, and while I would have changed the ending, it's just a movie ;)Our Alternate Ending #1:Since Elsa is Winter, Anna is Summer. Elsa had knocked Anna's powers out when she hit her with the snowball as a little girl, and Anna gets her magic back when Kristoff takes her to see the trolls. Then, she's able to stop her sister's eternal winter, by bringing summer. The sisters then find that they need each other to be balanced, and are able to be best friends again. Elsa doesn't have to fear her powers, because she has her sister to thaw everything back out again.Anna is actually the true love of Hans, and he's not cold-hearted. Kristoff ends up being Elsa's true love, and both girls find themselves able to be close sisters again, while also each having their true loves. All 4 live happily ever after!Our Alternate Ending #2:Kristoff ends up being Anna's true love, and Hans ends up being Elsa's true love. Each guy balances their girl out: winter to summer and vice versa (think about it: blonds with red- heads...winters with summers). They all balance each other out, and with the help of her new love, Elsa is able to control her powers.Overall:This is definitely a movie I will be watching again and again, and will soon become part of our home collection, I'm sure. If you haven't seen it yet, you should!! If you're a fan of Disney movies, enjoyed Tangled, or just enjoy comedy and a good story, be sure to give Frozen a shot!","['watch', 'frozen', 'recently', 'write', 'review', 'ken', 'mixed', 'feeling', 'film', 'good', 'overall', 'kinda', 'bum', 'aspect', 'good', 'music', 'let', 'go', 'epic', 'song', 'olaf', 'song', 'hilarious', 'olaf', 'hilarious', 'adore', 'character', 'line', 'epic', 'kristoff', 'conversation', 'sven', 'time', 'pet', 'awesome', 'laugh', 'loud', 'hilarious', 'see', 'movie', 'disappoint', 'han', 'mean', 'really', 'see', 'come', 'also', 'like', 'twist', 'elsa', 'need', 'man', 'kind', 'woman', 'love', 'direction', 'go', 'two', 'guy', 'two', 'girl', 'girl', 'get', 'someone', 'love', 'able', 'sister', 'bad', 'nothing', 'find', 'anything', 'bad', 'movie', 'awesome', 'would', 'change', 'end', 'movie', 'alternate', 'end', 'since', 'elsa', 'winter', 'anna', 'summer', 'elsa', 'knock', 'anna', 'power', 'hit', 'snowball', 'little', 'girl', 'anna', 'get', 'magic', 'back', 'kristoff', 'take', 'see', 'troll', 'able', 'stop', 'sister', 'eternal', 'winter', 'bring', 'summer', 'sister', 'find', 'need', 'balance', 'able', 'best', 'friend', 'elsa', 'fear', 'power', 'sister', 'thaw', 'everything', 'back', 'anna', 'actually', 'true', 'love', 'han', 'cold', 'hearted', 'kristoff', 'end', 'elsa', 'true', 'love', 'girl', 'find', 'able', 'close', 'sister', 'also', 'true', 'love', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'alternate', 'end', 'kristoff', 'end', 'anna', 'true', 'love', 'han', 'end', 'elsa', 'true', 'love', 'guy', 'balance', 'girl', 'winter', 'summer', 'vice', 'versa', 'think', 'blond', 'red', 'head', 'winter', 'summer', 'balance', 'help', 'new', 'love', 'elsa', 'able', 'control', 'power', 'overall', 'definitely', 'movie', 'watch', 'soon', 'become', 'part', 'home', 'collection', 'sure', 'see', 'yet', 'fan', 'disney', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'tangle', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'good', 'story', 'sure', 'give', 'frozen', 'shot']","[23, 5, 1253, 165, 161, 1082, 680, 3, 17, 166, 629, 443, 17, 58, 30, 13, 566, 11, 32, 11, 364, 32, 364, 1190, 8, 213, 566, 67, 1730, 181, 20, 983, 338, 190, 798, 364, 16, 1, 808, 44, 218, 22, 16, 40, 27, 9, 129, 4, 99, 145, 193, 251, 6, 754, 13, 42, 148, 42, 76, 76, 19, 304, 6, 294, 15, 65, 156, 71, 212, 65, 1, 338, 26, 209, 41, 1, 3926, 41, 98, 4, 105, 7, 205, 4, 1138, 7, 24, 234, 3008, 48, 76, 7, 19, 150, 74, 67, 55, 16, 123, 294, 284, 15, 310, 105, 221, 205, 15, 71, 99, 677, 294, 34, 327, 4, 187, 24, 15, 775, 132, 74, 7, 103, 62, 6, 44, 366, 1329, 67, 41, 4, 62, 6, 76, 71, 294, 351, 15, 27, 62, 6, 224, 795, 81, 3926, 41, 67, 41, 7, 62, 6, 44, 41, 4, 62, 6, 148, 677, 76, 105, 205, 3038, 3493, 37, 3657, 1564, 317, 105, 205, 677, 135, 108, 6, 4, 294, 128, 24, 166, 174, 1, 23, 580, 179, 94, 533, 1327, 207, 16, 182, 176, 2, 1, 91, 83, 91, 279, 17, 12, 207, 57, 5, 1103]"
807,9,"Over the past sixteen months the world has developed literal ""Frozen Fever"", as evident in the billions of dollars of DVD, Blu-ray, toy and clothing sales. Everything is amazing about this film, it's hard to put it all into one review.The attitudes of the characters contrast each other perfectly with the chilling outlying of the plot. Care free Anna and Olaf balance with hard-toned Kristoff and paranoid Elsa.But the best parts of the movie are definitely the 'Let It Go' sequence and the revival of Anna from her frozen heart. Not from Elsa's love, as everybody else at first thought, but from the sacrifice of herself in order to save her sister.The computer animation is also astonishing, giving the movie that feel of early 1800's Norway. With the close-knit kingdom of Arendelle virtually coupled to the sea and nestled in the snow-covered mountains, it gives a feel of reality.Overall this movie is by far the highest-grossing and highest-selling animated feature of all time, but it's still not considered the best, compared to the original wave of Disney features, including 'The Lion King', 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast'. That's why I didn't give it the extra star.","['past', 'sixteen', 'month', 'world', 'developed', 'literal', 'frozen', 'fever', 'evident', 'billion', 'dollar', 'dvd', 'blu', 'ray', 'toy', 'clothing', 'sale', 'everything', 'amaze', 'film', 'hard', 'put', 'one', 'review', 'attitude', 'character', 'contrast', 'perfectly', 'chill', 'outlying', 'plot', 'care', 'free', 'anna', 'olaf', 'balance', 'hard', 'tone', 'kristoff', 'paranoid', 'elsa', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'definitely', 'let', 'go', 'sequence', 'revival', 'anna', 'frozen', 'heart', 'elsa', 'love', 'everybody', 'else', 'first', 'thought', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'save', 'sister', 'computer', 'animation', 'also', 'astonish', 'give', 'movie', 'feel', 'early', 'norway', 'close', 'knit', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'virtually', 'couple', 'sea', 'nestle', 'snow', 'cover', 'mountain', 'give', 'feel', 'reality', 'overall', 'movie', 'far', 'high', 'gross', 'high', 'sell', 'animate', 'feature', 'time', 'still', 'consider', 'best', 'compare', 'original', 'wave', 'disney', 'feature', 'include', 'lion', 'king', 'aladdin', 'beauty', 'beast', 'give', 'extra', 'star']","[276, 860, 126, 610, 4375, 5, 1881, 2892, 1159, 1446, 540, 1081, 1030, 463, 2136, 2991, 132, 96, 3, 307, 196, 10, 161, 1536, 8, 956, 456, 1117, 4752, 52, 293, 593, 7, 32, 677, 307, 627, 67, 3085, 4, 34, 94, 1, 174, 30, 13, 502, 2581, 7, 5, 80, 4, 6, 841, 270, 36, 92, 635, 496, 111, 15, 642, 21, 27, 1811, 57, 1, 53, 594, 2265, 351, 77, 199, 2607, 398, 1002, 39, 712, 214, 57, 53, 940, 166, 1, 142, 206, 783, 206, 718, 38, 229, 20, 68, 421, 34, 350, 230, 2256, 2, 229, 349, 152, 97, 485, 149, 203, 57, 1237, 249]"

809,6,"This's an unpopular opinion but I never really cared for this movie. The animation's amazing and the characters are interesting but the songs are annoying and some of the jokes are hit-or-miss. The premise's interesting as it's about sister love rather than the typical love you see in a Disney movie. Princess Elsa (Idina Menzel) and her younger sister Anna (Kristen Bell) are close but an accident caused by Elsa's cryokinetic powers causes them to be separated by their parents. Rather than being taught to control her powers she's instead isolated which causes even more problems in the future. Anna, not understanding what her sister's going through due to having her memories erased after the accident becomes more and more distant.When they finally meet again years later at a party it's nice but an accident involving Elsa's powers causes her to flee. Prior to the party Anna meets a seemingly charming prince named Hans (Santino Fontana) (who turns out to be the main antagonist revealed later on in an actually good twist). Anna tries to find Elsa afterwards with the help of Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and a snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). As I said earlier the animation's amazing. It really looks nice. The characters are fun to watch and they have good chemistry but the songs aren't very memorable in my opinion, rather they're annoying and forgettable. That may sound like blasphemy but it's just an opinion. Little kids will definitely like this movie while adults may not enjoy the songs.","['unpopular', 'opinion', 'never', 'really', 'care', 'movie', 'animation', 'amaze', 'character', 'interest', 'song', 'annoy', 'joke', 'hit', 'miss', 'premise', 'interest', 'sister', 'love', 'rather', 'typical', 'love', 'see', 'disney', 'movie', 'princess', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'close', 'accident', 'cause', 'elsa', 'cryokinetic', 'power', 'cause', 'separate', 'parent', 'rather', 'taught', 'control', 'power', 'instead', 'isolated', 'cause', 'even', 'problem', 'future', 'anna', 'understand', 'sister', 'go', 'due', 'memory', 'erase', 'accident', 'becomes', 'distant', 'finally', 'meet', 'year', 'later', 'party', 'nice', 'accident', 'involve', 'elsa', 'power', 'cause', 'flee', 'prior', 'party', 'anna', 'meet', 'seemingly', 'charm', 'prince', 'name', 'han', 'santino', 'fontana', 'turn', 'main', 'antagonist', 'reveal', 'later', 'actually', 'good', 'twist', 'anna', 'try', 'find', 'elsa', 'afterwards', 'help', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'josh', 'gad', 'say', 'earlier', 'animation', 'amaze', 'really', 'look', 'nice', 'character', 'fun', 'watch', 'good', 'chemistry', 'song', 'memorable', 'opinion', 'rather', 'annoy', 'forgettable', 'may', 'sound', 'like', 'blasphemy', 'opinion', 'little', 'kid', 'definitely', 'like', 'movie', 'adult', 'may', 'enjoy', 'song']","[2597, 258, 88, 22, 293, 1, 21, 96, 8, 122, 11, 238, 451, 234, 271, 1222, 122, 15, 6, 191, 376, 6, 16, 2, 1, 29, 4, 141, 116, 73, 15, 7, 162, 146, 351, 480, 328, 4, 2534, 24, 328, 786, 118, 191, 1372, 128, 24, 208, 782, 328, 28, 198, 607, 7, 216, 15, 13, 404, 412, 972, 480, 380, 2076, 241, 244, 47, 358, 1123, 192, 480, 584, 4, 24, 328, 1454, 1883, 1123, 7, 244, 1161, 235, 82, 183, 44, 688, 665, 113, 119, 634, 528, 358, 103, 17, 129, 7, 87, 71, 4, 2391, 135, 67, 455, 377, 45, 183, 32, 275, 257, 35, 846, 21, 96, 22, 66, 192, 8, 125, 23, 17, 1005, 11, 268, 258, 191, 238, 660, 171, 259, 9, 258, 48, 60, 174, 9, 1, 147, 171, 91, 11]"
810,8,"'The Snow Queen' had plagued both Walt himself in the 40's and others at Disney in the 90's trying to adapt it into an animated feature, and rightly so, for the charming Hans Christian Anderson fairytale was a story about two Danish children encountering a metaphor for isolation and emerging victorious through Christian faith. And while it HAD been adapted into some foreign animated films in the past, they were just not the sort of films you could market to a family audience. And in this mini-renaissance of Disney since John Lasseter became Disney Animation head in 2006, they finally realized that the answer to making a movie from the tale was the same as some of their past loose adaptations - adapt it in spirit, rewriting all but a theme and a few vague ideas/details.This is kind of all right, as it turns out - such Disney films as Aladdin, Hercules, Mulan, The Jungle Book and more are successes in spite of how far they stray from the source. And so, with Frozen, it's not terribly important that it is technically adapted more then the fact that it is. For the movie is fully it's own thing.In the kingdom of Arendelle, there are two princesses, Anna and Elsa, the latter blessed with magical ice powers. They use this to play games, until Anna is smacked one day in the head with an ice blast. They get help from a shaman who fixes Anna and erases her memories of Elsa's magic, advising her to control this by keeping her hidden. ""Conceal, don't feel,"" they say, except this had the added effect of making Elsa so nervous she can't deal with even a little emotion without her power manifesting. Some time later, it is Elsa's coronation, and, For The First Time In Forever (one of the movie's better songs), the gates are to be opened for citizens and diplomats alike to mingle and partake. Yet when a fight breaks out between Elsa and Anna, and her power is shown, she flees the kingdom to the nearby mountain. The magnitude of her outburst freezes the whole kingdom, destroying much of everything. Forgiving and feeling a bit guilty, Anna sets off to find her sister, and fix the curse.You could be forgiven, from looking at the above, for thinking that Elsa is the protagonist. Alas, it is Anna, and that is the main factor that keeps this from reaching the level of last year's Wreck-It-Ralph, a film which this is otherwise very close to; the most interesting character is the deuteragonist. Otherwise, the film is a remarkable success. While the plot may seem imbalanced, that character is the focus (as it is in many great Disney Animations) shields this potential issue.Though the marketing took great efforts to conceal it, this is a musical, and a splendid one at that. If not on the level of Beauty And The Beast, is is still extremely good. Only one noodle-of-a-number fails, with most of the rest effective, two doing their job with exciting gusto, and one towering over the rest. That would be ""Let It Go"", the solo for Elsa after her flight. It is destined to be the song that takes this movie to Broadway.And the movie works because Anna, despite being upstaged by her sister, is likable. So is her companion Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. Even the comic sidekick, Olaf the snowman, is likable, despite being designed from a marketing viewpoint. Partly because the movie makes it clearly he is dumb, but mostly because he actually has a place in the plot. And the movie is fun, and has depth, in ways that it makes abundantly clear, but are still very much appreciated.And it is unquestionably gorgeous; possessing some of the best CG animation from Disney amongst a color scheme of muted colors and hazy lightning indoors, reserving the visual splendor for the snow and ice. The way they shine and reflect, their structural precision, the diffraction and refraction... like Wreck-It-Ralph before it, it is better suited to CG then traditional animation, the one area it which it surpasses that film; it is very hard to imagine any look serving the film better then the one it has.Frozen is a simple and straightforward film. It does take risks by, among other things, having no real villain (though it can't help but position a Duke early on as though he is, and the character barely registers thereafter, the one plot mishap that really rubbed me the wrong way), and it knows and embraces it's tradition of fantasies for children and children within adults. It is a great Disney film - beautiful in it's detail of character and design, possessing a simple and sweetly touching emotional template, and full of thrilling sequences. Not a Disney masterpiece, but more then capable of standing with some of the other Disney greats over the years. As long as they can keep making films this great, more power to them. 8.5/10","['snow', 'queen', 'plague', 'walt', 'others', 'disney', 'try', 'adapt', 'animate', 'feature', 'rightly', 'charm', 'han',

The story is an adaptation of 'The Snow Queen' by Hans Christian Andersen, and in Disney tradition is it a rather loose adaptation (I would say more inspired by some elements in the story rather than being based upon the story itself). I have to say that is by biggest complaint, so little of the original tale is in this story.My second biggest complaint is the storm near the end of the movie - Its over-long. A dying girl would not last that long, though I guess with her heart freezing she might last longer in the cold. That said, Its a great movie.

812,1,"Iam by no means an expert reviewer, but I'll do my best for you to get my insight of this overly praised nonsensical garbage! Of course I can't speak for everyone, and my review is based on the demographic of this movie. Its for girls, or sissy boys. Of course I'm not just going to debunk a movie solely on it's intended audience; I mean princess movies like this can have a smart message and a well developed plot. For instance, like Mulan, that movie showed that no matter your gender, if you have great endurance you can accomplish anything. At least that's what I got out of it. This movie just glorifies female smarts and male stupidity. It's songs are annoying, there's no real villain, therefore the story isn't very engaging. I know this isn't a completely fair review, but as a male I feel this story was just to prissy and relied on too much beauty. I guess it's a good movie if your into that sort of thing, but I'm not. If I were to even Try to see this in the eyes of it's intended audience, I'd give it a 7. Why? Because it's not original, it doesn't leap out of the box and try something different. Instead, we get some cheesy jokes, and some sappy musicals! That was fine in the 90s, but it's just plain embarrassing now. Plus the songs aren't anything like ""make a man out of you."" That song was truly inspiring and is definitely a classic. Nothing in this movie is worthy of classical, it's just, mediocre. I give it a 1 because I just couldn't sit through the thing without the sudden urge to vomit, just too pretty and nothing special about it. It doesn't deserve the hype, it's nothing special.","['iam', 'mean', 'expert', 'reviewer', 'best', 'get', 'insight', 'overly', 'praise', 'nonsensical', 'garbage', 'course', 'speak', 'everyone', 'review', 'base', 'demographic', 'movie', 'girl', 'sissy', 'boy', 'course', 'go', 'debunk', 'movie', 'solely', 'intend', 'audience', 'mean', 'princess', 'movie', 'like', 'smart', 'message', 'well', 'developed', 'plot', 'instance', 'like', 'mulan', 'movie', 'show', 'matter', 'gender', 'great', 'endurance', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'least', 'get', 'movie', 'glorifies', 'female', 'smart', 'male', 'stupidity', 'song', 'annoy', 'real', 'villain', 'therefore', 'story', 'engage', 'know', 'completely', 'fair', 'review', 'male', 'feel', 'story', 'prissy', 'rely', 'much', 'beauty', 'guess', 'good', 'movie', 'sort', 'thing', 'even', 'try', 'see', 'eye', 'intend', 'audience', 'give', 'original', 'leap', 'box', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'instead', 'get', 'cheesy', 'joke', 'sappy', 'musical', 'fine', 'plain', 'embarrass', 'plus', 'song', 'anything', 'like', 'make', 'man', 'song', 'truly', 'inspire', 'definitely', 'classic', 'nothing', 'movie', 'worthy', 'classical', 'mediocre', 'give', 'sit', 'thing', 'without', 'sudden', 'urge', 'vomit', 'pretty', 'nothing', 'special', 'deserve', 'hype', 'nothing', 'special']","[218, 1818, 1198, 34, 19, 3102, 1200, 535, 2127, 1539, 228, 641, 109, 161, 256, 1645, 1, 76, 408, 228, 13, 4919, 1, 2649, 913, 159, 218, 29, 1, 9, 1001, 185, 18, 610, 52, 1758, 9, 931, 1, 78, 375, 1288, 25, 5021, 2883, 212, 250, 19, 1, 237, 1001, 431, 2529, 11, 238, 195, 104, 1241, 12, 619, 56, 291, 1257, 161, 431, 53, 12, 1299, 31, 149, 388, 17, 1, 539, 43, 28, 87, 16, 336, 913, 159, 57, 230, 2539, 598, 87, 89, 140, 208, 19, 922, 451, 2175, 51, 470, 915, 1989, 569, 11, 212, 9, 14, 145, 11, 329, 500, 174, 69, 156, 1, 790, 1803, 752, 57, 708, 43, 137, 1072, 2343, 136, 156, 316, 483, 406, 156, 316]"

815,-,"To say that I was apprehensive about going to see Disney's latest animated film, Frozen (2013) would be a bit of an understatement. I viewed t the film as simply an extension of what I saw as Disney's latest trend. Example DreamWorks Animations released How to Train Your Dragon (2010), and soon after Disney counters with their own Celtic-based adventure, Brave (2013) (which, admittedly, was one of Pixar's best films ever). More than an original masterpiece, I thought Frozen would be a reaction to DreamWorks foray into a winter wonderland with Rise of the Guardians (2012). And, from the ads and trailers, I felt like Frozen was just going to be a holiday season, money-grabber. So, coming from a Disney kid I really need to stop underestimating Disney. This movie wasn't just good it was absolutely, breathtakingly fantastic.First off, comparing Disney to DreamWorks was incredibly wrong of me. I beg forgiveness. While DreamWorks seems to have a standard formula for their more successful animated features (HTTYD, Kung Fu Panda, Rise of the Guardians), Disney is constantly throwing original and exciting material at their audiences (also, this film apparently has been in the works since the 1990's. Never judge a book by its cover). Frozen is no exception. Based (very) loosely off of the Danish folk tale, The Snow Queen (1845), by Hans Christian Anderson, the film sets up a unique scene in the land of Arendal where sisters Anna (Kristin Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) struggle to connect after years of estrangement, caused by Elsa's mysterious ice-and-snow magic powers and her inability to control them.I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, so let's just get the criticisms out of the way.Unlike some people, my tiff isn't so much with the character demographics. Let's be realistic here, people, Frozen is set in a Nordic fairytale land. But, rather than making Elsa or Anna black, Asian, Inuit or otherwise, why not add a little variety? Not every little girl out there is white, blonde with blue/green eyes and a teeny-teeny waist. Hopefully in the future, the creators of Frozen (who also produced Tangled, obviously), will add a little bit of variety to their character designs.The story was fantastic, but sometimes lagged when the characters weren't singing their hearts out. There were several times when I sat twitching in the auditorium, impatiently waiting for the next song so that the story could actually move forward.Undoubtedly, one of the film's greatest moments was the performance of ""Let it Go"" by Idina Menzel, who absolutely astounded with her killer vocals. The sequence was astonishingly beautiful in addition, ""Let It Go"" is just a simply beautiful song.And talking about the MUSIC! I was immediately in love after the movie's first song, ""Frozen Heart"" and the wonderful duet in ""For the First Time in Forever"" (adorable). Though it's not apparent whether or not Frozen will go down with the older Disney classics, the parallels that it has to to older musical tales such as The Lion King,Mulan, or Beauty and the Beast is undeniable. It's a wonderful improvement from the somewhat flat songs of Tangled, and might just be the best musical-film that Disney has made in decades. But with the killer team of Christophe Beck, Robert Lopez (The Book of Mormon) and Kristen Anderson-Lopez (Robert's wife how cute!), what could you expect?And what is a Disney story without a love story? Yet, Frozen throws the conventional love story to the wind in this adaptation. More than the often ridiculous notion of ""true love,"" Frozen supports the wonderful idea that ""everyone's a bit of a fixer upper,"" that you can ""fix this fixer- upper with a little bit of love,"" and that Prince Charming's aren't all that they're cracked up to be. Sometimes, the best love stories are the ones that take time, and are unexpected in the best ways possible much like real life.My favorite part of Frozen, however, wasn't the romantic aspect of the film it was the lack thereof. While some critics have bashed the film for its lack of focus on one particular protagonist, the story at its base is about two sisters and their love for one another.In layman's terms, it's a classic Disney variation of an old fairy tale, complete with just the right combination of wonderful characters, charming music, a beautiful story arc and its specific brand of Disney magic (ice or otherwise) that DreamWorks could never hope to replicate. But, more than it's a break from traditional Disney-fairy-tale magic, with the typical, romantic formula that everyone's seen before. It's glorious family entertainment.Or, if you're a hopeless Disney kid like me, it's a little slice of your childhood, that will send your little Disney-kid heart aflutter.","['say', 'apprehensive',

816,1,"First, I've been seeing many Disney movies for about twenty years, and I like most of them. 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Alladin', 'Lion King', 'Pocahontas', 'Mulan', 'Hunchback of Notre Dame', and more recently 'Tangled' to just name a few I really like. So, hearing a lot of good things about 'Frozen', two Oscars and whatnot, decided to give it a go.Man, nothing could prepare me for what I saw. I barely managed to withstand the first ten minutes or so, but forced myself to watch it whole. Next day, I still couldn't believe how bad it was, so decided to see it again just to be sure. I'm stupid for wasting so much time, but whatever.1) The Good. This will be short. I liked some of the interaction between Kristoff and Anna. Also, two morals, 'love is the cure for everything' and 'don't marry someone you barely met' are good and dandy. Well, could have been better with better execution, but I'm trying to find something good in here. And that's it really. 2) The Bad - nearly everything else.Music. It is probably the only Disney picture in which I hate all of the songs and nearly the entire music score. Upon second watching I think that I can stand roughly 10 seconds of ~25 minutes of songs. Some of them, like that snow-fellow song, are just a disgrace. And who the hell allowed Elsa to sing? It was just painful to listen, especially on higher notes. And don't let me get started on the lyrics. Yuck. Also, music is supposed to just blend in, and naturally expand into song when necessary. Here we have characters that talk, then suddenly sing for no apparent reason, then talk, then...whatever. It sounds like a bad musical, or extremely bad pop opera.Characters.What do we have here? Idiot parents, that instead of loving and caring for their daughters, especially the older, troubled one, put her in a room and alienate her, making her afraid of everything. I shudder to think what real life implications that could have. Psycho, anyone?Elsa. We are supposed to believe that she is trying to protect her little sister from harm. Yet, she is stupid and egocentric enough to not see that that separation hurts even more. After 15 or 17 years living like that, her baby sister should have hated her. So, after the inevitable break down at the coronation, she escapes, and decides to live in an ice castle (by the way, eating what? snow?). Screw responsibility. I was hoping that maybe now, finally, she can try to learn to control her powers, being alone and uhm... happy? No dice. And screw her sister, whose she actually did hurt again, more seriously then the first time, and then nearly killed with that Marshmallow dude.Anna. OK, I kinda like this character, but she is the very definition of irresponsibility, with a 'desperate to get married' flavor thrown in. Still, she - by some miracle, I guess - retained her liveliness, and wasn't as paper thin character as some others.Kristoph. Yeah, obvious love interest nr. 2. Sorta interesting character, that unfortunately doesn't do anything important, really. Too bad the writers didn't decide to pair him with Elsa. Would have been way better imho.Hans. Obvious love interest nr. 1. At least for the first half of the movie. This guy just doesn't make sense. I couldn't believe the whole 'I don't love you, just want to rule' plot twist. If that was his motive from the start, then he should try to woo the queen, not Anna. Or later, after already being engaged to Anna, he should just let that crossbow guy kill Elsa. With a little effort, he could've been much more interesting character. But he is not.Olaf. Obligatory wacky sidekick nr. 1. Or nr. 2. Whatever. Fails to be funny. So that makes him useless, right? Should be forbidden to sing.Sven. Obligatory wacky sidekick, other number. Doesn't speak, and actually is funny sometimes. Still he's got nothing on Maximus.Story.I got the feeling that creators just made this on the fly, as they went. No, seriously. It looks like several people had various, sometimes contradicting ideas, and just put them all together without much of a thought. Other reviewers wrote a lot about that, so I won't be doing that in depth.3) The Ugly ...or not. Okay, animation is very pretty. I liked the landscapes. So it should be up there with the Good. Worth half a star, I guess.4) Final.Overall, just forget this movie. Bad story, bad music, mostly bad characters, forced jokes. I have no idea why it was awarded two Oscars, and have IMDb rating ~7.9, at the moment of writing this review. Watch Tangled instead, it's far superior in every aspect.","['first', 'see', 'many', 'disney', 'movie', 'twenty', 'year', 'like', 'beauty', 'beast', 'alladin', 'lion', 'king', 'pocahontas', 'mulan',

817,3,"Frozen is one the more frustrating movie's I've seen in a long while.I never wanted to like a movie more then Frozen. Everything seemed set for a true master piece of beautiful story telling, classic characters and unforgettable musical numbers. Unfortunately what we got was a story that tried to hard for its own good to be clever. Glaring character inconsistency and plot holes that snowballed up until nothing any of the characters did made any sense at all. And lackluster song writing that has no idea what it wants to be. We get everything from an African style chant, to an a Celtic sounding number, to what sounds like a country music balled by Carrie Underwood.Many critics and fans alike have called Frozen the best Disney film sense ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Little Mermaid"" and even ""The Lion King"" Is it truly as good as these classics? No. Not even close. Frozen isn't even in the same Galaxy as ""The Lion King"".The story follows two young princesses, Anna and Elsa. Anna is completely normal and only longs for true love, and Elsa who is Well...not so much. She as the ability to manipulate and create ice. Both sisters have spent the better part of a decade on apostate sides of Elsa's locked door do to an icy accident, a rock trolls completely worthless advice and the worst parental guidance imaginable. On her coronation day, after Elsa comes of age to be crowned queen, she accidentally looses control of her powers and flees into the wood and builds an ice castle to sulk unaware that her fear as manifested itself into an internal winter that threatens the entire kingdom. Anna now must go into the wilderness to find her sister and convince her to put an end to the weather. The side characters that surround our two princesses during this journey are all, for the most expendable to the plot. The character Hans should have never existed and is only present for a big twist at the end that completely negates his characters personality in the first two thirds of the movie. The character Kristoff could have been dropped all together and it would have changed the ultimate out come very little.  Olaf, a walking talking Snow man is the only side character that really needs to be here and is arguably the films main marketing draw. The film is literally humorless until he shows up a full hour into the movie. He gets is own nifty song about how he only longs for Summer, but doesn't know the consequences... It's funny because he's a snow man... but after that he's pretty much sidelined to quirky one liners and sight gags.  Now we come to the music. Supposedly The best since ""The Lion King""! There's five songs in ""The Lion King with a running time of 88 minutes.There are nine different musical numbers in ""Frozen"", at least two never should have made it passed the editing room, and with a running time of 102 minutes, almost a full half hour is dedicated to musical numbers leaving a brisk hour and ten minutes to tell the story. 5 songs take place in the first half hour alone. It is perfectly okay to donate so much time to your songs as long they are fun, classy and help move the story and develop the characters. Frozen's Songs does very little of that.Here we get clumsy lyrics like ""I don't know if I'm elated or gassy but I'm somewhere in that zone""To""Is it the way that he runs scared? Or that he's socially impaired? Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods?"" Yeah... classy! I guess one could argue that ""The Lion King"" has its moments of goofy bathroom style lyrics as far as Pumba's flatulent related back story goes. But I refuse to except that as a legitimate argument as long as ""Fixer Upper"" still exists in our society. This song will forever by a black stain on Disney's musical legacy. The exception, of course, is ""Let it go"", the only song that feels like true effort was put into it. Idina Manzel sells the heck out of it, even though I never thought her voice really matched her character model. (Being more then 20 years her characters senior) But even that song falls flat do to the writers refusal to allow Elsa to fully embrace her new found self worth and freedom she has so passionately been singing about. The next time we see Elsa she's the same scared, weak, volatile character she was before she belted out her ""Girl Power"" song.  Plot inconsistency abound! For example. When Anna finds Elsa in her ice castle Elsa tells Anna that she ran away in order to protect her and everyone else from her powers. But when Anna presses the matter Elsa, in what appears to be a very deliberate act, creates a giant ice monster to attack Anna and Kristoff.  Way to protect, Elsa! Also, Elsa doesn't seem to know that she's cursed her kingdom with eternal winter, despite all the land being covered in two foot of snow in the middle if Summer. Could she not look out the front door of her castle and see? Then there's the Rock Smurfs. Oh my god the rock Smurfs! Clearly a by product of the writers getting yellow with envy over the success of the minions in ""Despicable Me"" The best part of this movie by far is it's visuals. The movie is absolutely gorgeous to behold. But ice candy alone can not save a film who's heart clearly froze somewhere in its creation.","['frozen', 'one', 'frustrate', 'movie', 'see', 'long', 'never', 'want', 'like', 'movie', 'frozen',

818,4,"Ah, the greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment. This movie honestly left me wondering if many of the reviewers paid a visit to the glorious state of Colorado before watching this movie.Yes, the graphics were fantastic. But the animation was terrible. I'm sorry, but the facial expressions were simply badly drawn. It was a major step back compared to Tangled. Voice acting was... not. No, really, it wasn't acting. It was just reading the script off the sheet. Plain, emotionless, boring.Don't get me started on the music. This was the first Disney movie ever where I couldn't hear the music from the cacophony of instruments. Tune? What tune? It was also the first Disney movie ever where my daughter didn't get off the couch and dance to the music. Pretty much every musical number in it evoked just one emotion - impatience. When is this awful music going to end?Don't get me started on the voices. If you thought Pierce Brosnan sounded out of tune in ""Mamma Mia"", you haven't heard the singing in Frozen. At least in Brosnan's case his singing was a bit of an in-joke, a bit of self-irony, and in general terms - wasn't too bad. In case of a Disney movie built around singing, it was very bad. These actors can't sing. Please don't force them to, or don't hire them.The celebrated ""Let it go"" sounds like something that came out of the Taylor Swift sweatshop of pop clichés. If the singing wasn't so bad I'd have sworn it was her. So if you aren't into pop country music, you'll have trouble enjoying it. I know I did.Then comes the movie's redeeming factor - apparently, an act of true love isn't limited to ""boy kiss girl""; in fact, it can be love between siblings too. And to get to this groundbreaking revelation from Disney I had to sit through an hour and a half of torture. I'm sorry, but if someone truly believes this is a sign of the new Disney Renaissance, they need to have their head checked. This movie is on par with the direct to video releases like the Barbie films. Barbie Thumbelina comes to mind, at least thankfully it had no singing in it. 4/10 and I'm being generous here.","['ah', 'great', 'expectation', 'great', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'honestly', 'left', 'wonder', 'many', 'reviewer', 'paid', 'visit', 'glorious', 'state', 'colorado', 'watch', 'movie', 'yes', 'graphic', 'fantastic', 'animation', 'terrible', 'sorry', 'facial', 'expression', 'simply', 'badly', 'drawn', 'major', 'step', 'back', 'compare', 'tangle', 'voice', 'act', 'really', 'act', 'reading', 'script', 'sheet', 'plain', 'emotionless', 'boring', 'get', 'start', 'music', 'first', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'hear', 'music', 'cacophony', 'instrument', 'tune', 'tune', 'also', 'first', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'daughter', 'get', 'couch', 'dance', 'music', 'pretty', 'much', 'every', 'musical', 'number', 'evoke', 'one', 'emotion', 'impatience', 'awful', 'music', 'go', 'end', 'get', 'start', 'voice', 'thought', 'pierce', 'brosnan', 'sound', 'tune', 'mamma', 'mia', 'heard', 'sing', 'frozen', 'least', 'brosnan', 'case', 'sing', 'bit', 'joke', 'bit', 'self', 'irony', 'general', 'term', 'bad', 'case', 'disney', 'movie', 'built', 'around', 'sing', 'bad', 'actor', 'sing', 'please', 'force', 'hire', 'celebrate', 'let', 'go', 'sound', 'like', 'something', 'come', 'taylor', 'swift', 'sweatshop', 'pop', 'clich', 'sing', 'bad', 'sworn', 'pop', 'country', 'music', 'trouble', 'enjoy', 'know', 'come', 'movie', 'redeem', 'factor', 'apparently', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'limited', 'boy', 'kiss', 'girl', 'fact', 'love', 'sibling', 'get', 'groundbreaking', 'revelation', 'disney', 'sit', 'hour', 'half', 'torture', 'sorry', 'someone', 'truly', 'believe', 'sign', 'new', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'need', 'head', 'checked', 'movie', 'par', 'direct', 'video', 'release', 'like', 'barbie', 'film', 'barbie', 'thumbelina', 'come', 'mind', 'least', 'thankfully', 'sing', 'generous']","[2257, 25, 452, 25, 1038, 1, 542, 330, 532, 61, 1198, 1843, 1341, 1483, 881, 23, 1, 325, 714, 253, 21, 432, 777, 1482, 1069, 341, 1471, 747, 823, 668, 74, 350, 83, 86, 112, 22, 112, 1416, 395, 5031, 915, 370, 19, 120, 58, 36, 2, 1, 81, 568, 58, 2891, 804, 804, 27, 36, 2, 1, 81, 389, 19, 3933, 1067, 58, 136, 31, 115, 51, 184, 2961, 10, 240, 874, 58, 13, 41, 19, 120, 86, 92, 5017, 5032, 259, 804, 4883, 4884, 357, 63, 5, 250, 5032, 514, 63, 95, 451, 95, 429, 623, 657, 65, 514, 2, 1, 787, 200, 63, 65, 518, 63, 576, 272, 3323, 1728, 30, 13, 259, 9, 89, 40, 3443, 2917, 658, 274, 63, 65, 4924, 658, 872, 58, 1073, 91, 56, 40, 1, 1199, 945, 755, 112, 62, 6, 1576, 408, 372, 76, 201, 6, 409, 19, 1546, 1833, 2, 708, 487, 346, 1614, 777, 304, 329, 220, 1676, 108, 2, 465, 99, 317, 2930, 1, 1028, 721, 970, 288, 9, 1250, 3, 1250, 40, 320, 250, 1910, 63, 5033]"

Yes, it leaves a few plot questions unanswered, and a few things could have been explained more, but I still enjoyed the music and the story. I actually liked it better the second time I saw it a few months ago.The voices singing in the opening credits and again in the coronation scene and at the end are beautiful. As a singer I appreciate the perfect blending of the various tones. My least favorite song is the troll song, but if you listen closely part of the song mentions the power of fear vs. love which is a main theme of the movie. Kristin Bell has the better solo voice IMO, but was overshadowed because she didn't sing the popular Oscar nominated song. I didn't like Olaf very much the first time, and I thought his song was silly, but his character grew on me with a second viewing. His scene with Anna towards the end of the movie when he explains true love to her is sweet.

With an evil villain, and an unlikely hero, this movie gives you everything you want and deserve. I didn't watch this movie for almost a year, after it came out. My older sister kept telling me it was amazing and that I had to watch it. So one night, I gave in, and I watched it. It blew me away. The graphics, the characters, the music, were all so awesome, that I couldn't deny it any longer. I had Frozen Fever, like many others in the world. This movie is not only for children.

I bet I could even get my Dad to watch it, and get him to admit that he didn't hate it.This movie takes us to Arendelle, a magical kingdom run by Elsa. She is queen, and her sister, Anna, is the princess. Anna and Elsa lost their parents at a young age, so Elsa had to grow up quickly. She also had to struggle with her secret magic power, that no one knew about. Not even Anna. At one point Anna did know, and so did their parents, but they had to erase Anna's memory, when she got hurt. On the day of her coronation, Elsa accidentally uses her ice power to freeze the kingdom and then she runs away. Anna, who just met who she thinks is the love of her life, goes to follow her. On the way, Anna meets Kristoff, and his trusty reindeer, who help her track Elsa down. They also meet Olaf, a living snowman, who Elsa had created. Together the three go to find Elsa. But what they don't know, is that Hans, Anna's possible soul mate, is taking over the kingdom, and wants Elsa dead. When Anna returns after Elsa tells her to leave her alone, Hans leaves her to die. Elsa eventually comes home, saves Anna, and Hans is banished for his crimes. Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10.","['movie', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'even', 'sound', 'like', 'disney', 'word', 'movie', 'take', 'faraway', 'land', 'fill', 'magic', 'wonder', 'hope', 'evil', 'villain', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'movie', 'give', 'everything', 'want', 'deserve', 'watch', 'movie', 'almost', 'year', 'come', 'old', 'sister', 'kept', 'tell', 'amaze', 'watch', 'one', 'night', 'give', 'watch', 'blew', 'away', 'graphic', 'character', 'music', 'awesome', 'deny', 'longer', 'frozen', 'fever', 'like', 'many', 'others', 'world', 'movie', 'child', 'anyone', 'age', 'seventeen', 'love', 'sister', 'twenty', 'two', 'love', 'cousin', 'nine', 'love', 'bet', 'could', 'even', 'get', 'dad', 'watch', 'get', 'admit', 'hate', 'movie', 'take', 'u', 'arendelle', 'magical', 'kingdom', 'run', 'elsa', 'queen', 'sister', 'anna', 'princess', 'anna', 'elsa', 'lose', 'parent', 'young', 'age', 'elsa', 'grow', 'quickly', 'also', 'struggle', 'secret', 'magic', 'power', 'one', 'knew', 'even', 'anna', 'one', 'point', 'anna', 'know', 'parent', 'erase', 'anna', 'memory', 'get', 'hurt', 'day', 'coronation', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'us', 'ice', 'power', 'freeze', 'kingdom', 'run', 'away', 'anna', 'met', 'think', 'love', 'life', 'go', 'follow', 'way', 'anna', 'meet', 'kristoff', 'trusty', 'reindeer', 'help', 'track', 'elsa', 'also', 'meet', 'olaf', 'living', 'snowman', 'elsa', 'create', 'together', 'three', 'go', 'find', 'elsa', 'know', 'han', 'anna', 'possible', 'soul', 'mate', 'take', 'kingdom', 'want', 'elsa', 'dead', 'anna', 'return', 'elsa', 'tell', 'leave', 'alone', 'han', 'leaf', 'die', 'elsa', 'eventually', 'come', 'home', 'save', 'anna', 'han', 'banish', 'crime', 'overall', 'give', 'movie']","[1, 215, 215, 28, 259, 9, 2, 548, 1, 55, 5034, 757, 481, 150, 532, 384, 277, 104, 2801, 544, 1, 57, 132, 59, 483, 23, 1, 173, 47, 40, 64, 15, 498, 143, 96, 23, 10, 773, 57, 23, 2061, 101, 714, 8, 58, 338, 1893, 612, 5, 1881, 9, 61, 247, 126, 1, 70, 299, 139, 6, 15, 1393, 42, 6, 2058, 2636, 6, 1575, 54, 28, 19, 1703, 23, 19, 637, 333, 1, 55, 177, 199, 170, 77, 233, 4, 49, 15, 7, 29, 7, 4, 489, 118, 73, 139, 4, 285, 733, 27, 639, 508, 150, 24, 10, 488, 28, 7, 10, 117, 7, 56, 118, 972, 7, 412, 19, 305, 138, 343, 4, 300, 919, 33, 24, 282, 77, 233, 101, 7, 392, 37, 6, 79, 13, 378, 50, 7, 244, 67, 2263, 151, 135, 932, 4, 27, 244, 32, 704, 45, 4, 134, 332, 433, 13, 71, 4, 56, 44, 7, 673, 1074, 55, 77, 59, 4, 831, 7, 385, 4, 143, 322, 344, 44, 586, 368, 4, 652, 40, 533, 111, 7, 44, 2937, 3934, 166, 57, 1]"
823,10,"I've read some pretty nasty reviews and wondered if they watched the same movie I did. I think these people don't understand the Disney tradition. This is a ""classic"" Disney flick and one Walt Disney would have been proud of. I am an older person and of course I don't go out to the movies much but sat down and watched it at home, my grandkids copy. I was a music major in college and I can tell you anyone criticizing the songs, singing and anything musical in this movie simply has no musical education. The music is wonderful and the main character was NOT Elsa but Anna, even Disney has stated this. This movie has made a world wide impact with children and that is really what sets the mark for a movie like this. I'm appalled anyone could use the word ""worst"" in any sentence about this movie. It was a delight to watch. Kristen Bell did a wonderful job. The inspiration came from the Hans Christian Andersen story, Snow Queen, with Disney doing their own magic.Frozen grossed a worldwide total of $1,267,838,009. It is the fifth highest-grossing film ever, the highest-grossing animated film, the highest-grossing 2013 film. That's pretty good for a movie some are panning here. This movie was outstanding. ""Let it Go"" won an academy award for best song and the movie has been put in 41 different languages it is so popular. They say it's a phenomenon because kids aren't moving past it all over the world, many know the lyrics to all the songs. This had a monumental impact on people all over the world. It drew attention to Norway and also the Sami people. Tourism has risen because of this film. For someone to even suggest this was a bad movie amazes me and I definitely wouldn't hire them as a critic.""The Los Angeles Times extolled the film's ensemble voice talent and elaborate musical sequences, and declared Frozen was ""a welcome return to greatness for Walt Disney Animation Studios."" I loved this film and plan to watch it again. It was a huge success in Japan and obviously here too. Maybe Disney movies aren't everyone's cup of tea but it definitely is not the worst Disney movie or a bad movie at all. I recommend it to anyone who likes movies in the flavor of the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. This one has a little something for all ages.","['read', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'review', 'wonder', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'people', 'understand', 'disney', 'tradition', 'classic', 'disney', 'flick', 'one', 'walt', 'disney', 'would', 'proud', 'old', 'person', 'course', 'go', 'movie', 'much', 'sat', 'watch', 'home', 'grandkids', 'copy', 'music', 'major', 'college', 'tell', 'anyone', 'criticize', 'song', 'sing', 'anything', 'musical', 'movie', 'simply', 'musical', 'education', 'music', 'wonderful', 'main', 'character', 'elsa', 'anna', 'even', 'disney', 'state', 'movie', 'make', 'world', 'wide', 'impact', 'child', 'really', 'set', 'mark', 'movie', 'like', 'appalled', 'anyone', 'could', 'use', 'word', 'bad', 'sentence', 'movie', 'delight', 'watch', 'kristen', 'bell', 'wonderful', 'job', 'inspiration', 'come', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'disney', 'magic', 'frozen', 'gross', 'worldwide', 'total', 'fifth', 'high', 'gross', 'film', 'ever', 'high', 'gross', 'animate', 'film', 'high', 'gross', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'pan', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'let', 'go', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'song', 'movie', 'put', 'different', 'language', 'popular', 'say', 'phenomenon', 'kid', 'move', 'past', 'world', 'many', 'know', 'lyric', 'song', 'monumental', 'impact', 'people', 'world', 'drew', 'attention', 'norway', 'also', 'sami', 'people', 'tourism', 'risen', 'film', 'someone', 'even', 'suggest', 'bad', 'movie', 'amazes', 'definitely', 'hire', 'critic', 'los', 'angeles', 'time', 'extol', 'film', 'ensemble', 'voice', 'talent', 'elaborate', 'musical', 'sequence', 'declare', 'frozen', 'welcome', 'return', 'greatness', 'walt', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'love', 'film', 'plan', 'watch', 'huge', 'success', 'japan', 'obviously', 'maybe', 'disney', 'movie', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'definitely', 'bad', 'disney', 'movie', 'bad', 'movie', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'like', 'movie', 'flavor', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'one', 'little', 'something', 'age']","[547, 136, 3227, 161, 532, 23, 1, 37, 46, 216, 2, 1071, 69, 2, 805, 10, 410, 2, 26, 1408, 64, 441, 228, 13, 1, 31, 1196, 23, 533, 3773, 2411, 58, 823, 2888, 143, 299, 1339, 11, 63, 212, 51, 1, 341, 51, 58, 215, 119, 8, 4, 7, 28, 2, 881, 1, 14, 126, 1226, 1153, 70, 22, 144, 820, 1, 9, 299, 54, 158, 548, 65, 2361, 1, 1062, 23, 162, 146, 215, 373, 1788, 40, 44, 245, 339, 12, 39, 49, 2, 150, 5, 783, 1953, 1479, 5035, 206, 783, 3, 81, 206, 783, 38, 3, 206, 783, 3, 136, 17, 1, 2608, 1, 764, 30, 13, 856, 469, 34, 11, 1, 196, 140, 2135, 559, 35, 1981, 60, 242, 276, 126, 61, 56, 475, 11, 3833, 1153, 46, 126, 3603, 541, 2265, 27, 5036, 46, 3, 304, 28, 1049, 65, 1, 4055, 174, 3323, 730, 20, 3, 5037, 86, 800, 1862, 51, 502, 2741, 5, 1108, 385, 2198, 410, 2, 21, 311, 6, 3, 776, 23, 360, 577, 3048, 613, 232, 2, 1, 109, 2785, 3648, 174, 65, 2, 1, 65, 1, 262, 299, 9, 1, 3930, 48, 422, 149, 203, 10, 48, 89, 139]"
824,1,"Even though I was just around 11 or 12 years old when this movie came out, unlike most young girls at my age, I did not understand the movie at all or why people went so CRAZY over it and why all the other fantastic Disney movies like Tangled, Brave, The Princess and the Frog weren't appreciated in their time. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I understood at that young, preteen age.Animation: There are so many things that found annoying about the animation that I just couldn't stand. First of all, Anna and Elsa's body figures. I get that in every Disney movie ever, the lead girls were supposed to be slim and beautiful but they seemed too ""plastic"" They looked EXTRA tiny, from their very slim faces, and tiny waist, and their HUGE doll- like eyes.Take Tangled for example, we could see that Rapunzel was very tiny but at least she had the tiniest bit of chubbiness to her cheeks and arms but Anna and Elsa seem to have practically anorexic- like bodies.Mistakes: Most Disney movies have their fair share of mistakes here and there, but in Frozen, mistakes are literally EVERYWHERE. There were COUNTLESS mistakes I could point out even as an 12 year old girl.Like in the party scene after Elsa's coronation, the same heavy- weight, tan woman was copy and pasted everywhere, there were probably more characters that were repeatedly showing up everywhere. It annoyed me so much while watching the movie. There are many more examples that I could give, but I don't have enough time. I get that it's hard in the animating room and takes SO long to animate one scene but I don't think it would be too hard to make a variety of different background characters.The songs: These cheesy, tacky songs were absolute torture to have to sit through for the hour and a half long movie. I feel like the only half decent song in the movie was the chanting song played at the beginning and end of the movie. All others had no effect on me or the story itself, it would have been easier for the characters to just explain their struggles instead of having to sing through them for 3 minutes. Most of the lyrics are SO hard to understand, unlike most Disney Musicals, I think Disney should focus less on hiring famous people and should focus more on hiring talented people who actually know how to pronounce whilst singing.The Plot: Disney tried so hard for there to be a huge plot twist that nobody saw coming and to my surprise, most people didn't see it coming but I certainly did. Hans was so unbelievably fishy to me, especially proposing to Anna the day they met. I knew that his seemingly perfect character was going to change. They completely made Anna's character the stereotypical good girl character and made it seem like the woman is vulnerable and pretty much helpless throughout the movie. Whereas the men are the powerful, smart ones.The popularity: There are countless times where I heard ""Frozen is the only movie where the prince doesn't save the day"" One word, NO. These people who say that, clearly aren't real Disney fans, whereas I've seen nearly every Disney movie. Because there really are many movies where the prince doesn't save the day. The Princess and the Frog, Tiana was clearly the one who saved everyone by smashing Dr. Faciler's special amulet with the blood of the prince in it. How about the movie Brave, probably the most underrated Disney Princess movie that deserved way more credit, there wasn't even a prince, it based around a mother-daughter relationship. And what about Tangled, Flynn was not a prince, and Rapunzel saved Flynn from dying with her tears, healing his wound.I'm not looking forward to the sequel, but I want people to be able to enjoy it if they do like the movie. Frozen just isn't the type of movie I would like","['even', 'though', 'around', 'year', 'old', 'movie', 'come', 'unlike', 'young', 'girl', 'age', 'understand', 'movie', 'people', 'go', 'crazy', 'fantastic', 'disney', 'movie', 'like', 'tangle', 'brave', 'princess', 'frog', 'appreciate', 'time', 'many', 'thing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'understood', 'young', 'preteen', 'age', 'animation', 'many', 'thing', 'found', 'annoy', 'animation', 'stand', 'first', 'anna', 'elsa', 'body', 'figure', 'get', 'every', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'lead', 'girl', 'suppose', 'slim', 'beautiful', 'seem', 'plastic', 'look', 'extra', 'tiny', 'slim', 'face', 'tiny', 'waist', 'huge', 'doll', 'like', 'eye', 'take', 'tangle', 'example', 'could', 'see', 'rapunzel', 'tiny', 'least', 'tiniest', 'bit', 'chubbiness', 'cheek', 'arm', 'anna', 'elsa', 'seem', 'practically', 'anorexic', 'like', 'body', 'mistake', 'disney', 'movie', 'fair', 'share', 'mistake', 'frozen', 'mistake', 'literally', 'everywhere', 'countless', 'mistake', 'could', 'point', 'even', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'like', 'party', 'scene', 'elsa', 'coronation', 'heavy', 'weight', 'tan', 'woman', 'copy', 'paste', 'everywhere', 'probably', 'character', 'repeatedly', 'show', 'everywhere', 'annoyed', 'much', 'watch', 'movie', 'many', 'example', 'could', 'give', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'hard', 'animate', 'room', 'take', 'long', 'animate', 'one', 'scene', 'think', 'would', 'hard', 'make', 'variety', 'different', 'background', 'character', 'song', 'cheesy', 'tacky', 'song', 'absolute', 'torture', 'sit', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'movie', 'feel', 'like', 'half', 'decent', 'song', 'movie', 'chant', 'song', 'played', 'begin', 'end', 'movie', 'others', 'effect', 'story', 'would', 'easy', 'character', 'explain', 'struggle', 'instead', 'sing', 'minute', 'lyric', 'hard', 'understand', 'unlike', 'disney', 'musical', 'think', 'disney', 'focus', 'less', 'hire', 'famous', 'people', 'focus', 'hire', 'talented', 'people', 'actually', 'know', 'pronounce', 'whilst', 'sing', 'plot', 'disney', 'try', 'hard', 'huge', 'plot', 'twist', 'nobody', 'saw', 'come', 'surprise', 'people', 'see', 'come', 'certainly', 'han', 'unbelievably', 'fishy', 'especially', 'propose', 'anna', 'day', 'met', 'knew', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'character', 'go', 'change', 'completely', 'make', 'anna', 'character', 'stereotypical', 'good', 'girl', 'character', 'make', 'seem', 'like', 'woman', 'vulnerable', 'pretty', 'much', 'helpless', 'throughout', 'movie', 'whereas', 'men', 'powerful', 'smart', 'one', 'popularity', 'countless', 'time', 'heard', 'frozen', 'movie', 'prince', 'save', 'day', 'one', 'word', 'people', 'say', 'clearly', 'real', 'disney', 'fan', 'whereas', 'see', 'nearly', 'every', 'disney', 'movie', 'really', 'many', 'movie', 'prince', 'save', 'day', 'princess', 'frog', 'tiana', 'clearly', 'one', 'save', 'everyone', 'smash', 'dr', 'faciler', 'special', 'amulet', 'blood', 'prince', 'movie', 'brave', 'probably', 'underrated', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'deserve', 'way', 'credit', 'even', 'prince', 'base', 'around', 'mother', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'tangle', 'flynn', 'prince', 'rapunzel', 'save', 'flynn', 'die', 'tear', 'heal', 'wound', 'look', 'forward', 'sequel', 'want', 'people', 'able', 'enjoy', 'like', 'movie', 'frozen', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'like']","[28, 100, 200, 47, 64, 1, 40, 766, 73, 76, 139, 216, 1, 46, 13, 1008, 253, 2, 1, 9, 83, 335, 29, 659, 699, 20, 61, 43, 280, 1, 2167, 73, 4037, 139, 21, 61, 43, 231, 238, 21, 361, 36, 7, 4, 1220, 630, 19, 115, 2, 1, 81, 248, 76, 473, 5038, 93, 75, 2600, 66, 1237, 1936, 5038, 381, 1936, 2631, 360, 1287, 9, 336, 55, 83, 396, 54, 16, 527, 1936, 250, 95, 4096, 1933, 7, 4, 75, 1349, 9, 1220, 967, 2, 1, 1257, 781, 967, 5, 967, 643, 879, 1820, 967, 54, 117, 28, 47, 64, 76, 9, 1123, 90, 4, 343, 1376, 2280, 5039, 251, 2411, 4258, 879, 210, 8, 2872, 78, 879, 1127, 31, 23, 1, 61, 396, 54, 57, 164, 20, 19, 307, 38, 506, 55, 169, 38, 10, 90, 37, 26, 307, 14, 1519, 140, 617, 8, 11, 922, 11, 1798, 1614, 708, 487, 346, 169, 1, 53, 9, 346, 546, 11, 1, 1971, 11, 507, 160, 41, 1, 247, 278, 12, 26, 454, 8, 400, 639, 208, 63, 211, 475, 307, 216, 766, 2, 51, 37, 2, 261, 321, 3323, 903, 46, 261, 3323, 1356, 46, 103, 56, 2832, 1130, 63, 52, 2, 87, 307, 360, 52, 129, 1170, 157, 40, 445, 46, 16, 40, 442, 44, 3935, 5040, 121, 3633, 7, 138, 392, 488, 1161, 175, 8, 13, 209, 291, 14, 7, 8, 1567, 17, 76, 8, 14, 75, 9, 251, 2491, 136, 31, 2880, 296, 1, 1565, 459, 439, 1001, 10, 1872, 1820, 20, 357, 5, 1, 82, 111, 138, 10, 548, 46, 35, 690, 195, 2, 176, 1565, 16, 501, 115, 2, 1, 22, 61, 1, 82, 111, 138, 29, 659, 3301, 690, 10, 111, 109, 2160, 2871, 316, 2359, 82, 1, 335, 210, 1877, 2, 29, 1, 483, 50, 662, 28, 82, 256, 200, 883, 389, 153, 83, 1322, 82, 527, 111, 1322, 368, 748, 1234, 5041, 66, 571, 561, 59, 46, 294, 91, 9, 1, 5, 524, 1, 26, 9]"
825,10,"I walked into this movie not knowing it was based on a favorite childhood story, ""The Snow Queen"" by Andersen. As the story progressed, the similarities between the original and Disney's version appeared, as subtle as a snowflake and I began to see that the basic moral was the same: Love takes discipline! Yes, Love takes discipline to overlook flaws and see the good, to let the heart melt as the feeling progresses. Now back to Anna and Elsa: they are sisters and Older Sister is protective of Younger, a most natural condition, and thus the story plays out amid glorious animation. An added attraction is the setting, to my eye the setting during the Andersen years of circa 1820 - 1840 in Scandinavia. Lovely singing, of course, with 'Let It Go' deserving its accolades.

All of these tho fs fit in with the Disney classic title and I loved these aspects. However, it was the story I had some problems with. Sadly, problems which could easily r ironed out. Firstly, there is no explanation given as to why elsa has her snow powers...like in tangled/rapunzel's powers are explained from the magic flower...but in this there is no explanation provided. Then the family seek help from the trolls. Who are the trolls? Why does kristoff stay with them...where is his family? I loved the trolls I would have liked to have seen more! Through the road trip scenes there was a couple of scenes were I was slightly bored. I hate to admit as a Disney fan but this bit dragged in for me. I would have liked to have seen more of what elsa was getting up to!!! The film also lacked a villain, fair enough the duke was annoying but not evil and there is the hand twist which last about 5 mins. In most Disney films the villain is developed throughout the film. I also had issues with the ending. The fact that the sister love melted Anna was lovely....but they had ALWAYS loved each other. Anna never wanted to stop seeing elsa and the only reason that elsa stopped was because she loved Anna and wanted to protect her!!! If they had always loved each other how did that work. Plus, love helped elsa begin to control her powers??? How so, she always felt love. This seemed a bit slapdash for me. It was a great story but these elements seemed a bit rushed and let it down for me. Looking at more recent films like 'tangled' and 'princess and the frog' the story ever seems to slow down, there is a key villain, key message and everything is explained. Frozen seemed like they just rushed the ending. I also didn't realise the reference to hans Christian Anderson 'the snow queen' as elsa's character was rushed over! All in all I loved the songs and the story was good...especially the sister bond which was a nice change. 7 out of 10 from me...It would have been a 10 if all parts of the story made sense. Beautiful film though.","['huge', 'disney', 'fan', 'every', 'movie', 'say', 'excite', 'see', 'frozen', 'lead', 'little', 'disappointed', 'graphic', 'phenomenal', 'voice', 'amaze', 'character', 'likable', 'funny', 'unique', 'definitely', 'download', 'song', 'tho', 'f', 'fit', 'disney', 'classic', 'title', 'love', 'aspect', 'however', 'story', 'problem', 'sadly', 'problem', 'could', 'easily', 'r', 'iron', 'firstly', 'explanation', 'give', 'elsa', 'snow', 'power', 'like', 'tangle', 'rapunzel', 'power', 'explain', 'magic', 'flower', 'explanation', 'provide', 'family', 'seek', 'help', 'troll', 'troll', 'kristoff', 'stay', 'family', 'love', 'troll', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'road', 'trip', 'scene', 'couple', 'scene', 'slightly', 'bore', 'hate', 'admit', 'disney', 'fan', 'bit', 'drag', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'elsa', 'get', 'film', 'also', 'lack', 'villain', 'fair', 'enough', 'duke', 'annoy', 'evil', 'hand', 'twist', 'last', 'min', 'disney', 'film', 'villain', 'developed', 'throughout', 'film', 'also', 'issue', 'end', 'fact', 'sister', 'love', 'melt', 'anna', 'lovely', 'always', 'love', 'anna', 'never', 'want', 'stop', 'see', 'elsa', 'reason', 'elsa', 'stop', 'love', 'anna', 'want', 'protect', 'always', 'love', 'work', 'plus', 'love', 'help', 'elsa', 'begin', 'control', 'power', 'always', 'felt', 'love', 'seem', 'bit', 'slapdash', 'great', 'story', 'element', 'seem', 'bit', 'rush', 'let', 'look', 'recent', 'film', 'like', 'tangle', 'princess', 'frog', 'story', 'ever', 'seem', 'slow', 'key', 'villain', 'key', 'message', 'everything', 'explain', 'frozen', 'seem', 'like', 'rush', 'end', 'also', 'realise', 'reference', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'elsa', 'character', 'rush', 'love', 'song', 'story', 'good', 'especially', 'sister', 'bond', 'nice', 'change', 'would', 'part', 'story', 'make', 'sense', 'beautiful', 'film', 'though']","[360, 2, 176, 115, 1, 35, 447, 16, 5, 248, 48, 476, 714, 1583, 86, 96, 8, 402, 85, 414, 174, 2030, 11, 3280, 1272, 560, 2, 69, 590, 6, 443, 110, 12, 198, 1670, 198, 54, 403, 2228, 3936, 2655, 806, 57, 4, 39, 24, 9, 83, 527, 24, 400, 150, 806, 458, 72, 997, 135, 123, 123, 67, 510, 72, 6, 123, 26, 9, 16, 1734, 1066, 90, 398, 90, 774, 604, 333, 637, 2, 176, 95, 1045, 26, 9, 16, 4, 19, 3, 27, 273, 104, 1257, 164, 762, 238, 277, 323, 129, 197, 1624, 2, 3, 104, 610, 296, 3, 27, 519, 41, 201, 15, 6, 359, 7, 765, 163, 6, 7, 88, 59, 284, 16, 4, 180, 4, 284, 6, 7, 59, 513, 163, 6, 107, 569, 6, 135, 4, 160, 128, 24, 163, 155, 6, 75, 95, 25, 12, 401, 75, 95, 525, 30, 66, 399, 3, 9, 83, 29, 659, 12, 81, 75, 1065, 1165, 104, 1165, 185, 132, 400, 5, 75, 9, 525, 41, 27, 1544, 1246, 44, 245, 467, 39, 49, 4, 8, 525, 6, 11, 12, 17, 121, 15, 482, 192, 209, 26, 94, 12, 14, 217, 93, 3, 100]"
827,2,"When I watched this movie with my younger sister and her best friends, I looked up the movie spoilers before watching it in the theater. When I thought this movie was going to be excellent because it supposedly not a Disney movie about a Disney Princess falling in love with a prince or a man, but TWO Disney Princesses WHO HAPPEN TO BE SISTERS. But when I read the spoilers, I was wrong. OH SO WRONG. The Norwegian culture is fit in but it is simplified for the music, setting, names, and clothing. The movie starts out well with the snowflakes and Norwegian chanting and even the ice harvesters foreshadowing the events later in the movie. The songs were childish. They felt like they were written from nursery rhymes and gained recognition by repeating lyrics over and over. YES, ALL OF THE SONGS. It doesn't help that ""Let It Go"" is sang by Idina Menzel(voice of Elsa and Elphaba from Wicked), no wonder why Elsa got so much fame than she deserved!But the introduction of the sisters was not quite like I expected. They were introduced to us at an early age: 5 and 8 years old. The younger one is bothering the older one while she's sleeping and the older one shoves her off the bed. The younger one, Anna finally gets the older one to play with her by asking to build a snowman. AND apparently, for some reason, the introduction of Elsa's powers was not quite I had in mind... What annoyed me was the huge plot hole that could've made this movie have more sense. Elsa is born with a rare condition that lets her magically conjure ice and snow, but yet, no was assigns her to a teacher that can teach her to control her powers.What definitely angers me to no end is the fact a lot of people blame Anna for jumping around too fast which (supposedly) her fault for the start of MANY problems in the movie. But yet, NO ONE pays attention to the fact Elsa SLIPPED ON HER OWN ICE THAT SHE HERSELF HAS CREATED. I can say the same for Elsa, if she hadn't created that ice rink in the first place, she would not have hit Anna either. SO THEREFORE, IT IS BOTH OF THEIR FAULTS. People also mainly blame the parents, King Agdar and Queen Iduna for the events leading to the Great Freeze Of Arendelle. They also blame the Chief Pabbie and the Trolls too for not giving enough advice to Elsa and her parents about how to handle her powers. Yet, so little people feel bad for Anna getting her memory erased and hurt by Elsa. When the parents decided to SHUT BOTH Anna and Elsa inside their home, Elsa is the only one pitied. While Anna is basically ignored by much of the viewers. Yes, I understand that Anna's plight is less bad than Elsa's plight, but that doesn't make her problems in-existent. She still has amnesia of Elsa's powers and yet she was never told of the incident that almost cost her life. 13 years of Anna passing by Elsa's bedroom door and Elsa struggling to restrain her powers, a few people mistake Anna for harassing Elsa when Anna is trying to get Elsa to step out and face the world.People who bash Anna and praise Elsa are people who do not get the concept of the movie and/or have very biased opinions are shameful to call themselves Frozen fans. Ever since Frozen came out, there has been a war over whether Frozen was a Disney masterpiece or a disgrace to Disney. It doesn't end here. There has been MASS CONSUMERISM of mostly Elsa-related merchandise which includes her dresses, tiara, dolls, baby wipes, fruit snacks, etc. The comments in Frozen-related videos on YouTube are EVEN WORSE. They are illiterate and don't even form words, such a terrible fan base Frozen has amassed!Another part I hate about the Frozen fan base is that they CHEER on Elsa to kill those Duke's guards and that they blindly defend her rash decision to throw the other main characters with HER VIOLENT BODYGUARD, MARSHMALLOW.They should realize that Elsa is supposed to use her powers for good rather than evil as she wished to do. I am disgusted at how people want her to act evil because it is ""cool.""Also, why do people bash Anna when she does something wrong? Like trying to marry Hans, yelling at Elsa, not stop jumping, wake Elsa up, etc? Is it the fact people think Anna is a spotlight-steal-er for Elsa? OR is it the fact that they think Anna is ""useless"" because she has no ""powers"" like her sister?The Jack Frost×Elsa shippers are annoying as well. They claim they are not shallow fan girls EVEN THOUGH IT IS OBVIOUS that they ship Jack and Elsa due to their superficial appearances AND ICE POWERS. No matter what excuse they come up with, it's always pathetic. They claim that they ship Jack and Elsa just because they wear blue clothes and......have blue eyes.......? That is not a strong argument for that ship. Jack Frost is from Dreamworks and Elsa is from Disney. This ship has GOTTEN SO POPULAR TO THE POINT THERE ARE 10,000 people who SIGNED A PETITION TO HAVE THE JELSA PAIRING CANON.In the sequel, I very hope that Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, Sven and everybody else do not get put in the bus under Elsa. Because if the sequel ends up like that, Frozen officially is pandering to the fan base. Therefore, it is not a good movie if they are taking advice from shallow fans.I rest my case.","['watch', 'movie', 'young', 'sister', 'best', 'friend', 'look', 'movie', 'spoiler', 'watch', 'theater',

Some trolls who are never explained either and look like minions with a gray texture put over them spout some magical crap and Elsa banishes herself to her room for some reason and the two are kept apart. Anna immediately becomes as obnoxious as possible and the two sing a trite, uninspired song.Elsa becomes queen, shirks her responsibilities, blah blah blah, she sings a dang earworm of a song that you'll never want to hear again after your kids sing it for the 10,000th time in the car on the way home from the cinema, Anna falls in love and goes looking for her, some crappy new character is introduced, Olaf is annoying, Kristoff has no personality, so on and so forth.Bland and overrated.

He was supposed to be the slapstick, but it wasn't funny. Donkey from Shrek was cuter, and had exponentially more personality. Plain annoying. He's supposed to be a cherished relic of the sisters' past, but neither one ever emotionally recognizes him.2) First Disney movie I've ever *sighed* to when I realized another song was starting. Singing about being gassy? I miss classy, noble, well spoken princesses. Keep your ""like omg what-everrrrr"" nobility.3) ""Fixer Upper"". What exactly with the reindeer was outside of nature's laws? Sharing food, talking to, and befriending animals isn't. I don't know what they're suggesting.4) How can you take a Hans Christian Andersen story, and use his name Hans as the villain? That's not a very respectful tribute.5) Who managed the kingdom while the girls were growing up? Where did they all go on coronation day? Not one trusted local soul?6) Hans met the princess on chance, and was very genuine before even knowing who she was. When he fell in the water in the beginning, he had the look of ""love at first sight"" in his eyes. He managed the kingdom impeccably, and even stopped others from killing Elsa. Why? I thought he wanted her dead, why not just conveniently turn an eye? His personality change was the most in-congruent character change I have ever seen in my life. It's as if they didn't plan for it, and changed their minds to make him the villain 30 seconds before it happened.7) Trolls. They didn't recognize Anna with the white hair? Not even the chief? They have no respect for a marriage engagement, freely blowing it off, not knowing the circumstances? 8) They play off the whole ""love cures a freezing heart"" cliché, which is fine, but Anna didn't begin to grow cold as her condition worsened? Anna purely loved Elsa from the very beginning, and Elsa loved her in return. Why wasn't Anna able to control her powers out of love beforehand? No one ""learned to love"". They all did from the beginning.9) After shooting her sister in the chest, Elsa makes a snowman that almost kills her sister, yet continues to talk about not wanting to hurt people.There's more, but is more even necessary at this point?","['year', 'use', 'imdb', 'first', 'movie', 'force', 'review', 'quick', 'summation', 'ridiculous', 'snowman', 'equivalent', 'another', 'reviewer', 'accurately', 'label', 'jar', 'jar', 'binks', 'suppose', 'slapstick', 'funny', 'donkey', 'shrek', 'cuter', 'exponentially', 'personality', 'plain', 'annoy', 'suppose', 'cherished', 'relic', 'sister', 'past', 'neither', 'one', 'ever', 'emotionally', 'recognizes', 'first', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'sigh', 'realize', 'another', 'song', 'start', 'sing', 'gassy', 'miss', 'classy', 'noble', 'well', 'spoken', 'princess', 'keep', 'like', 'omg', 'everrrrr', 'nobility', 'fixer', 'upper', 'exactly', 'reindeer', 'outside', 'nature', 'law', 'share', 'food', 'talk', 'befriending', 'animal', 'know', 'suggest', 'take', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'story', 'use', 'name', 'han', 'villain', 'respectful', 'tribute', 'manage', 'kingdom', 'girl', 'grow', 'go', 'coronation', 'day', 'one', 'trust', 'local', 'soul', 'han', 'met', 'princess', 'chance', 'genuine', 'even', 'know', 'fell', 'water', 'begin', 'look', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'eye', 'manage', 'kingdom', 'impeccably', 'even', 'stop', 'others', 'kill', 'elsa', 'thought', 'want', 'dead', 'conveniently', 'turn', 'eye', 'personality', 'change', 'congruent', 'character', 'change', 'ever', 'see', 'life', 'plan', 'change', 'mind', 'make', 'villain', 'second', 'happen', 'troll', 'recognize', 'anna', 'white', 'hair', 'even', 'chief', 'respect', 'marriage', 'engagement', 'freely', 'blowing', 'know', 'circumstance', 'play', 'whole', 'love', 'cure', 'freeze', 'heart', 'clich', 'fine', 'anna', 'begin', 'grow', 'cold', 'condition', 'worsen', 'anna', 'purely', 'love', 'elsa', 'begin', 'elsa', 'love', 'return', 'anna', 'able', 'control', 'power', 'love', 'beforehand', 'one', 'learn', 'love', 'begin', 'shoot', 'sister', 'chest', 'elsa', 'make', 'snowman', 'almost', 'kill', 'sister', 'yet', 'continue', 'talk', 'want', 'hurt', 'people', 'even', 'necessary', 'point']","[47, 158, 866, 36, 1, 272, 161, 1191, 1195, 45, 2325, 102, 1198, 4887, 2233, 1007, 1007, 1887, 473, 1751, 85, 2733, 1208, 407, 915, 238, 473, 3272, 15, 276, 1197, 10, 81, 910, 36, 2, 1, 81, 2473, 428, 102, 11, 120, 63, 5029, 271, 2834, 2541, 18, 1903, 29, 154, 9, 1925, 772, 737, 522, 151, 769, 1094, 3912, 781, 2098, 178, 876, 56, 1049, 55, 44, 245, 339, 12, 158, 183, 44, 104, 4757, 857, 77, 76, 285, 13, 343, 138, 10, 836, 2761, 1074, 44, 392, 29, 632, 1342, 28, 56, 843, 1013, 160, 66, 6, 36, 675, 336, 857, 77, 3789, 28, 284, 247, 286, 4, 92, 59, 831, 4239, 113, 336, 407, 209, 8, 209, 81, 16, 79, 776, 209, 320, 14, 104, 319, 290, 123, 1428, 7, 365, 844, 28, 3300, 1311, 1057, 1965, 4279, 2092, 56, 2996, 204, 127, 6, 1256, 282, 80, 274, 470, 7, 160, 285, 366, 1100, 7, 2115, 6, 4, 160, 4, 6, 385, 7, 294, 128, 24, 6, 2538, 10, 347, 6, 160, 1656, 15, 3381, 4, 14, 45, 173, 286, 15, 182, 647, 178, 59, 305, 46, 28, 1496, 117]"
830,6,"Warning... the reviews on here seem highly over-rated, and are likely those of Disney employees trying to boost the rating.** Spoilers ** I give this a 6/10, as the story lacks depth and creativity. Sure, it's a movie geared towards kids... but a good movie should also appeal to adults. Some parts were just beyond imaginable, and several begging questions went unanswered. The whole premise is that two sisters are raised in a huge castle, and their parents are king and queen... and they are princesses (wow Disney, so original). One of the girls has magic powers (basically the ability to shoot ice, like Frozone on The Incredibles), and the parents want to keep it a secret, so they keep both kids locked in the castle for the next 16 or so years, they don't even let them interact with each other... and they parents are out of the picture for the rest of the movie (bad parenting skills... you thing?). Finally the day comes when it's time for the girls to be introduced to people outside the castle (their 18th birthday??? The day she becomes queen??? who knows, its never explained). The daughter who shoots ice is portrayed to be the one of importance ( first born maybe? again, never explained), while the other is seen as basically out of the spotlight... she falls in love with pretty much the first guy she has laid eyes on in her life, and besides that both daughters magically have all this real-world knowledge and can speak perfectly fluent English (even though they pretty much have had minimal human interaction for nearly their entire life).So then, the ice princess' powers are revealed (they were concealed up to this point), and the town fears her... and then the entire rest of the movie is about her running away and living in fear of her powers (with the exception of the evil prince, who is trying to gain control of the town as the ice princess is battling her emotions... oh no!).The whole movie just seems so mindless and cliché... it has all the classic cliché Disney recipes, and is just not that memorable in my opinion. My daughter was even getting bored and restless through the endless irrelevant dialog. It just didn't seem nearly as creative or entertaining as Tangled, Beauty and the Beast, or How to Train a Dragon (yes, I realize this is Dreamworks)... and just felt like a rushed story thrown together to expand Disney's holiday toy lineup.I think one of the few things they got right though were the rock trolls, the snowman, and the reindeer... those characters really drove the entertainment value for the film.","['warn', 'review', 'seem', 'highly', 'rat', 'likely', 'disney', 'employee', 'try', 'boost', 'rating', 'spoiler', 'give', 'story', 'lack', 'depth', 'creativity', 'sure', 'movie', 'gear', 'towards', 'kid', 'good', 'movie', 'also', 'appeal', 'adult', 'part', 'beyond', 'imaginable', 'several', 'beg', 'question', 'go', 'unanswered', 'whole', 'premise', 'two', 'sister', 'raise', 'huge', 'castle', 'parent', 'king', 'queen', 'princess', 'wow', 'disney', 'original', 'one', 'girl', 'magic', 'power', 'basically', 'ability', 'shoot', 'ice', 'like', 'frozone', 'incredibles', 'parent', 'want', 'keep', 'secret', 'keep', 'kid', 'lock', 'castle', 'next', 'year', 'even', 'let', 'interact', 'parent', 'picture', 'rest', 'movie', 'bad', 'parent', 'skill', 'thing', 'finally', 'day', 'come', 'time', 'girl', 'introduce', 'people', 'outside', 'castle', 'th', 'birthday', 'day', 'becomes', 'queen', 'know', 'never', 'explain', 'daughter', 'shoot', 'ice', 'portrayed', 'one', 'importance', 'first', 'born', 'maybe', 'never', 'explain', 'see', 'basically', 'spotlight', 'fall', 'love', 'pretty', 'much', 'first', 'guy', 'laid', 'eye', 'life', 'besides', 'daughter', 'magically', 'real', 'world', 'knowledge', 'speak', 'perfectly', 'fluent', 'english', 'even', 'though', 'pretty', 'much', 'minimal', 'human', 'interaction', 'nearly', 'entire', 'life', 'ice', 'princess', 'power', 'reveal', 'conceal', 'point', 'town', 'fear', 'entire', 'rest', 'movie', 'run', 'away', 'living', 'fear', 'power', 'exception', 'evil', 'prince', 'try', 'gain', 'control', 'town', 'ice', 'princess', 'battling', 'emotion', 'oh', 'whole', 'movie', 'seem', 'mindless', 'clich', 'classic', 'clich', 'disney', 'recipe', 'memorable', 'opinion', 'daughter', 'even', 'get', 'bore', 'restless', 'endless', 'irrelevant', 'dialog', 'seem', 'nearly', 'creative', 'entertain', 'tangle', 'beauty', 'beast', 'train', 'dragon', 'yes', 'realize', 'dreamworks', 'felt', 'like', 'rush', 'story', 'thrown', 'together', 'expand', 'disney', 'holiday', 'toy', 'lineup', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'get', 'right', 'though', 'rock', 'troll', 'snowman', 'reindeer', 'character', 'really', 'drove', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film']","[1228, 161, 75, 472, 1055, 1016, 2, 4059, 87, 437, 419, 57, 12, 273, 609, 2824, 207, 1, 3696, 538, 60, 17, 1, 27, 484, 147, 94, 614, 5028, 608, 2211, 824, 13, 2365, 127, 1222, 42, 15, 760, 360, 168, 118, 97, 49, 29, 926, 2, 230, 10, 76, 150, 24, 570, 367, 1656, 33, 9, 5049, 2214, 118, 59, 154, 508, 154, 60, 382, 168, 418, 47, 28, 30, 2644, 118, 438, 303, 1, 65, 118, 1610, 43, 241, 138, 40, 20, 76, 736, 46, 769, 168, 1210, 3263, 138, 380, 49, 56, 88, 400, 389, 1656, 33, 918, 10, 1259, 36, 589, 232, 88, 400, 16, 570, 2042, 186, 6, 136, 31, 36, 148, 3515, 336, 79, 877, 389, 1663, 195, 126, 2266, 641, 456, 4845, 2246, 28, 100, 136, 31, 1939, 515, 1064, 501, 264, 79, 33, 29, 24, 528, 1232, 117, 602, 187, 264, 303, 1, 233, 101, 704, 187, 24, 645, 277, 82, 87, 1697, 128, 602, 33, 29, 240, 425, 127, 1, 75, 4030, 274, 69, 274, 2, 2977, 268, 258, 389, 28, 19, 604, 1716, 2328, 1187, 75, 501, 1014, 243, 83, 149, 203, 1124, 1412, 325, 428, 1035, 155, 9, 525, 12, 1121, 332, 2506, 2, 1039, 463, 37, 10, 43, 19, 130, 100, 834, 123, 45, 151, 8, 22, 3464, 839, 728, 3]"
831,10,"It was good, but it had third act pacing problems, the denouement is rushed and the plot was a little disjointed and ironically took place behind closed doors.I feel like Anna and Kristoff ending up together is just too damn convenient; it doesn't feel real enough because their characters aren't sufficiently developed.Olaf isn't terrible but his kiddie appeal is too pronounced at times and they should have toned down the slapstick just a bit.The trolls were a total misstep and ultimately useless. The movie could have done without them and their musical number. It feels like they're a holdover from the Andersen adaptation; they don't really go anywhere meaningful and the springtime feeling of their visuals clash with the rest of the movie at a time that breaks up the tension in a major way instead of letting it build. They feel, like Olaf, like padding, or maybe they were the favorite of someone in the production. They could be altered without harming the narrative.It's not Wreck-It Ralph but it's better than most every other Disney movie. The CG is stunning; the snow was a true spectacle; the ice needed work but liquid water was done perfectly. This had better win Best Animated Feature on technical merits alone.I teared up a few times for Beck's score and I think this would actually work better as a straight-up drama without the musical aspect because once they get past Let it Go the songs are superfluous.","['good', 'third', 'act', 'pace', 'problem', 'denouement', 'rush', 'plot', 'little', 'disjoint', 'ironically', 'take', 'place', 'behind', 'close', 'door', 'feel', 'like', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'end', 'together', 'damn', 'convenient', 'feel', 'real', 'enough', 'character', 'sufficiently', 'developed', 'olaf', 'terrible', 'kiddie', 'appeal', 'pronounce', 'time', 'tone', 'slapstick', 'bit', 'troll', 'total', 'misstep', 'ultimately', 'useless', 'movie', 'could', 'without', 'musical', 'number', 'feel', 'like', 'holdover', 'andersen', 'adaptation', 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'meaningful', 'springtime', 'feel', 'visuals', 'clash', 'rest', 'movie', 'time', 'break', 'tension', 'major', 'way', 'instead', 'let', 'build', 'feel', 'like', 'olaf', 'like', 'pad', 'maybe', 'favorite', 'someone', 'production', 'could', 'alter', 'without', 'harm', 'narrative', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'well', 'every', 'disney', 'movie', 'cg', 'stun', 'snow', 'true', 'spectacle', 'ice', 'need', 'work', 'liquid', 'water', 'perfectly', 'well', 'win', 'best', 'animate', 'feature', 'technical', 'merit', 'alone', 'tear', 'time', 'beck', 'score', 'think', 'would', 'actually', 'work', 'well', 'straight', 'drama', 'without', 'musical', 'aspect', 'get', 'past', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'superfluous']","[17, 715, 112, 564, 198, 4114, 525, 52, 48, 2972, 2268, 55, 188, 750, 351, 478, 53, 9, 7, 67, 41, 332, 1480, 1858, 53, 195, 164, 8, 610, 32, 432, 2748, 484, 2832, 20, 627, 1751, 95, 123, 1479, 5050, 941, 1490, 1, 54, 137, 51, 184, 53, 9, 339, 891, 22, 13, 2139, 1514, 53, 267, 4651, 303, 1, 20, 340, 1214, 823, 50, 208, 30, 202, 53, 9, 32, 9, 4093, 232, 189, 304, 700, 54, 3756, 137, 709, 802, 352, 379, 18, 115, 2, 1, 1303, 315, 39, 62, 1506, 33, 99, 107, 1013, 456, 18, 374, 34, 38, 229, 1891, 5051, 344, 748, 20, 1307, 223, 37, 26, 103, 107, 18, 984, 745, 137, 51, 443, 19, 276, 30, 13, 11, 2952]"
832,1,"Don't get me wrong. The animation in this film, like in most Disney Pixar films is fantastic. But animation does not in any way, shape, or form make a good movie. Sure it's good eye-candy and pretty to look at, but it's honestly a lazy way to grab people's attention.Frozen is a movie that pretends to be something it is not; a good movie.Let's start off with the songs. Songs in Disney films normally have purpose in the film. They relate to the movie, and include lyrics that relate to a later or earlier event in the movie. However in Frozen, this is not the case. Let's use 'Let it Go' for an example. The overrated and stupid song known as 'Let it Go' seems pretty deep, and sad, right? You'd think maybe this song would have more behind it. Nope! The meaning of the song is later diminished, as if the song never happened in the first place.'Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?' is a song that is placed there for no reason. Other Pixar films would have done that scene, without the song. Maybe added a little comedy element. Such as the character doing acrobats, and trying to make as much noise as possible. It'd be so much better than a little girl singing to a door, and doing dangerous stunts while she's at it.And the story? Don't get me started. Elsa (the boring protagonist) has NO background. No explanation to how or why she has the powers she has. She is shown as the villain for most of the movie, but then there's a special twist at the end which says ""NOPE. F**K YOU. WE'RE DOING IT OUR WAY!"" If you're going to have a plot take a twist, at least do it right. At least hint stuff. At least have some real build up, instead of throwing it out there for the hell-of-it.Olaf is annoying. What more can I say? He's a snowman who loves to joke when there's something EXTREMELY serious happening. Oh yeah, but he's Olaf, so it's okay.The other characters in this movie? Like the real villain (Hans, I think); pointless, forgettable and worthless! Same as that dude who is supposed to like Anna. He's even more forgettable, I've forgotten his name! When that happens, you've got a terrible movie! Their ""love"" has no build up. Some trolls sing to them both, saying how they should love one another because, y'know, it's Disney! What sorta' Disney film is complete without pointless romantic relationships?Frozen fans will turn to me and say ""It's a kids film, it needs no depth"".

833,10,"This movie is loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson ""Snow Queen"" with the only similar things between the two is there's a character who's a Snow Queen and there's two characters in the movie named Kai and Gerda who are far different then their book counterparts and they are unnamed in the movie so unless you read on a website what there names are you wouldn't actually know, which in some cases can make the movie a great disappoint but in this case I think it worked to its favour, as being someone who has read the Snow Queen story beforehand I favoured the route the movie took. The movies have extremely beautiful visuals and all the effects they do with the ice shows how far CGI animation has come over the years. Every song in it is extremely well-done with my favourite one being ""Let it Go"" sung by the well-talented Idina Menzel. Every character in it is well-animated and well-voiced and there's no characters who brought the movie down or had a voice that was jarring to listen to. The character of Olaf is one of the funniest comic relief characters has done in their movies with almost every line he said either was heart-warming or left me laughing. But he's not the only character in the movie who brought laughs: there was also Anna who quirkiness made her stand out in Disney's Princess gallery who were usually well-refined and dignified, Kristoff who constantly argued with himself using his own voice and his impersonation of his reindeer Sven's voice, the Duke of Weselton who has some of the craziest lines and actions every in a Disney movie, and Oaken who only appeared in one scene but brought so much laughter and character in that few minutes of screen appearance. This movie also has some great villains with the primary antagonist being the Duke of Weselton and his two bodyguards who wanted to kill Elsa and unlock all of Arendelle's trade-able goods and the main antagonist being Hans who was only pretending to be nice for most of the movie to gain the trust of both Anna and the townspeople so that way he can both King of Arendelle and a hero amongst the townspeople, but after Anna returns from the North Mountain and tells him that Elsa had struck her and only an act of true love can save her life is his true intentions revealed where he only asked Anna to marry him as being the thirteenth in line for the throne he would've never gotten the chance to be king unless he married into it and after they were married he would ""stage an accident"" for Elsa and be hailed as a hero among the people for ""silencing the monster"" and bringing back summer. He trapped Anna in the room and left her there to die, which he placed all the blame on Elsa and told the townspeople ""With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa with treason and sentence her to death."" A lot of critics are saying that his villainous reveal was tagged-on and was unnecessary but I say that it was actually quite good. Santino Fontana played both his ""fake hero"" persona and his true villainous persona really good and all these years Disney has made their princes to be chivalrous people who would do anything to protect the girl they just met, but Hans shows how this kind of mindset that most Disney princesses share that once their eyes meet with a certain guy that they'll fall in love, get married without getting to know each other first and live happily ever after is both really flawed and can leave them in mortal danger. This movie is another Disney classic and is worthy to be seen by all fans of Disney","['movie', 'loosely', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'similar', 'thing', 'two', 'character', 'snow', 'queen', 'two', 'character', 'movie', 'name', 'kai', 'gerda', 'far', 'different', 'book', 'counterpart', 'unnamed', 'movie', 'unless', 'read', 'website', 'name', 'actually', 'know', 'case', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'disappoint', 'case', 'think', 'work', 'favour', 'someone', 'read', 'snow', 'queen', 'story', 'beforehand', 'favour', 'route', 'movie', 'take', 'movie', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'effect', 'ice', 'show', 'far', 'cgi', 'animation', 'come', 'year', 'every', 'song', 'extremely', 'well', 'favourite', 'one', 'let', 'go', 'sung', 'well', 'talented', 'idina', 'menzel', 'every', 'character', 'well', 'animate', 'well', 'voiced', 'character', 'brought', 'movie', 'voice', 'jarring', 'listen', 'character', 'olaf', 'one', 'funniest', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'movie', 'almost', 'every', 'line', 'say', 'either', 'heart', 'warm', 'left', 'laugh', 'character', 'movie', 'brought', 'laugh', 'also', 'anna', 'quirkiness', 'make', 'stand', 'disney', 'princess', 'gallery', 'usually', 'well', 'refine', 'dignify', 'kristoff', 'constantly', 'argue', 'use', 'voice', 'impersonation', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'voice', 'duke', 'weselton', 'craziest', 'line', 'action', 'every', 'disney', 'movie', 'oaken', 'appear', 'one', 'scene', 'brought', 'much', 'laughter', 'character', 'minute', 'screen', 'appearance', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'villain', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'duke', 'weselton', 'two', 'bodyguard', 'want', 'kill', 'elsa', 'unlock', 'arendelle', 'trade', 'able', 'good', 'main', 'antagonist', 'han', 'pretend', 'nice', 'movie', 'gain', 'trust', 'anna', 'townspeople', 'way', 'king', 'arendelle', 'hero', 'amongst', 'townspeople', 'anna', 'return', 'north', 'mountain', 'tell', 'elsa', 'struck', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'life', 'true', 'intention', 'reveal', 'ask', 'anna', 'marry', 'thirteenth', 'line', 'throne', 'would', 'never', 'gotten', 'chance', 'king', 'unless', 'married', 'married', 'would', 'stage', 'accident', 'elsa', 'hail', 'hero', 'among', 'people', 'silence', 'monster', 'bring', 'back', 'summer', 'trap', 'anna', 'room', 'left', 'die', 'place', 'blame', 'elsa', 'told', 'townspeople', 'heavy', 'heart', 'charge', 'queen', 'elsa', 'treason', 'sentence', 'death', 'lot', 'critic', 'say', 'villainous', 'reveal', 'tag', 'unnecessary', 'say', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'santino', 'fontana', 'played', 'fake', 'hero', 'persona', 'true', 'villainous', 'persona', 'really', 'good', 'year', 'disney', 'make', 'prince', 'chivalrous', 'people', 'would', 'anything', 'protect', 'girl', 'met', 'han', 'show', 'kind', 'mindset', 'disney', 'princess', 'share', 'eye', 'meet', 'certain', 'guy', 'fall', 'love', 'get', 'married', 'without', 'get', 'know', 'first', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'really', 'flaw', 'leave', 'mortal', 'danger', 'movie', 'another', 'disney', 'classic', 'worthy', 'see', 'fan', 'disney']","[1, 696, 256, 44, 245, 467, 39, 49, 446, 43, 42, 8, 39, 49, 42, 8, 1, 183, 1940, 1816, 142, 140, 596, 3069, 1, 959, 547, 1960, 183, 103, 56, 514, 14, 1, 25, 808, 514, 37, 107, 3753, 304, 547, 39, 49, 12, 2538, 3753, 1650, 1, 55, 1, 423, 93, 267, 278, 33, 78, 142, 555, 21, 40, 47, 115, 11, 423, 18, 622, 10, 30, 13, 684, 18, 1356, 141, 116, 115, 8, 18, 38, 18, 521, 8, 599, 1, 86, 2241, 531, 8, 32, 10, 1526, 309, 297, 8, 1, 173, 115, 213, 35, 353, 80, 362, 330, 190, 8, 1, 599, 190, 27, 7, 14, 361, 2, 29, 3277, 460, 18, 4682, 67, 1176, 1247, 158, 86, 5053, 151, 181, 86, 762, 1233, 213, 345, 115, 2, 1, 2295, 582, 10, 90, 599, 31, 1679, 8, 211, 369, 1225, 1, 27, 25, 104, 1757, 634, 762, 1233, 42, 3938, 59, 286, 4, 5054, 199, 3939, 294, 17, 119, 634, 44, 1970, 192, 1, 1697, 836, 7, 2292, 50, 97, 199, 544, 2853, 2292, 7, 385, 1252, 214, 143, 4, 1367, 112, 62, 6, 111, 79, 62, 1659, 528, 581, 7, 390, 213, 952, 26, 88, 1271, 632, 97, 959, 895, 895, 26, 1115, 480, 4, 2976, 544, 471, 46, 5055, 495, 221, 74, 205, 900, 7, 506, 330, 368, 188, 1631, 4, 511, 2292, 1376, 80, 807, 49, 4, 1181, 2361, 517, 84, 730, 35, 2850, 528, 3191, 845, 35, 103, 124, 17, 688, 665, 507, 1537, 544, 2654, 62, 2850, 2654, 22, 17, 47, 2, 14, 82, 46, 26, 212, 513, 76, 392, 44, 78, 193, 4313, 2, 29, 781, 336, 244, 563, 148, 186, 6, 19, 895, 137, 19, 56, 36, 224, 795, 81, 22, 386, 322, 3874, 901, 1, 102, 2, 69, 790, 16, 176, 2]"

836,4,"So where to begin. This movie has a lot of strengths and clearly there is much talent behind this project. But it falls short due to it's failure to follow through with the themes and plot points presented. I can only imagine this is due to Mickey Mouse and his inability to let go of his insecure delusions of what makes a ""Classic"" a Classic. I'll start with the things I did like and keep it spoiler free for now.#1 The animation is great, especially the Ice magic/power, and the character personalities. Vibrant and very full of emotion and life, they really let the visual team go nuts on this one.#2 The two central characters Sisters Elsa and Anna, great dramatic tension between them, their charisma is through the roof. #3 No big surprise I am also on the ""Let It Go"" bandwagon. Iconic and unforgettable scene and song, enough to warrant admission price on its own. A great vocal performance by Idina Menzel that stands out even alongside other memorable classic Disney pieces.#4 Olaf the snowman could have been a lot more annoying then he was, I hate useless comedic relief characters as much as the next guy but this one kinda melted my heart.Which leads me to some gripes I have with the movie. #1 Not only Olaf but all the supporting cast are next to, or completely useless. The sisters may have gotten incomplete arcs, but they were lucky, no one else got any semblance to a character arc which leaves them flat uninteresting and completely lacking of any meaningful impact.#2 Furthermore they contrive the situation to the point where the movie derails into characters running, chasing, and bumbling from point A to point B only to pass each other by or find out they need to go to the next location for whatever arbitrary reason. Putting the character progression completely on ice for much of the duration. I haven't seen a Disney movie with this frantic and aimless a pacing before.The stuff that bothered me the most was specific plot points and unrealized themes, so for more details on why I feel this movie fails this requires (SPOILERS) Ye be warned! 1# Take Olaf for instance, why make a specific point of him being Anna's only memory remnant of the magic incident, bringing him to life so that he can run around and be cutely annoying and useless, leaving her none the wiser to her sisters condition and reason for shutting her out.#2 Why the need for two inconsequential antagonists. The conflict between Elsa and the Townsfolk would have been enough if the hysteria and fear would have been ramped up instead of petered out. It would also put Anna in the unique position of heroine and peacemaker between the two sides, complicated by her Heart being frozen. #3 The love triangle could have been complete without the needless ulterior motive of prince Hans. Had his actions been motivated by love for Anna it could have led to the same conclusion and served a bigger purpose then pointless villain. Further cementing the theme of Fear/love.#4 Anna's arc could have been a lot more true to character and theme if she didn't blindly persist in her naiveté even after spending time with Kristoff and Olaf. And added fuel to the would be love triangle.I think these points for sure were on the table at one time or another. But the control freaks at the top can't see a good story if it slaps them in the face, ""oh no we must have an antagonist and he must get his comeuppance"". ""God forbid the sidekicks are anything other then sidekicks"". ""Mocking the love at first sight trope is only allowed if said character still falls in the same pitfall later in the movie so that we can negate any extraneous character development"". (SPOILERS END)A genuine attempt at a gripping and heartfelt movie for all ages forcefully ground through a generic stock formula loosing its soul in the process. It just reeks of a certain meddling mouse In the end I hated this movie because Disney is so afraid to let the story live up to it's potential. Ignoring my ""what-if"" imaginary complaints I still find it kind of ironic and sad when the theme of love conquers fear can't keep the fear in Mickey from overpowering the love of the creators. Despite its exceedingly potent and poignant subject matter the whole experience left a really bad taste in my mouth.4/10","['begin', 'movie', 'lot', 'strength', 'clearly', 'much', 'talent', 'behind',

837,1,"Aside from being able to tell the ending of the film just by seeing the poster (the sisters side-by-side), I knew it was another animated musical from Disney (because the featured ""Let It Go"" song just didn't stop playing everywhere), so I had my expectations as low as could be when I watched it... And even so, it managed to be even worse than I was prepared it to be.The main character is Elsa, who should be based on Andersen's Snow Queen, but turns out to be more like one of Marvel's X-Men with godly powers. She can create matter by will out of nowhere, i.e., she produces ice without needing water, so she could pretty much destroy the whole universe by stacking up ice until the gravity would exceed that of the original singularity! Not enough? Of course not, she can also create LIFE, and not just any life, conscious and persistent lifeforms (remember, the snowman is THE SAME snowman every winter, so its consciousness obviously is able to exist throughout eternity, so even if it is not indestructible, as it can be melted down, its mind still stands and, given enough time, it would eventually return, the feat of a demigod, at least). Granted, the creatures are not the brightest LED lamps on the market, but, come on, she's just beginning to test her powers. More over, her powers are unlimited, she can cool down things without spending energy, i.e., she can revert entropy, she could ""reboot"" the universe itself! Very few characters in the scope of Marvel, DC or any other comic book publisher has been created so powerful... And despite all that powers, she's unable to handle a bunch of invading soldiers, in her castle, armed with pikes and swords?! Sure...The X-Woman has a sister, ""Easy Anna"", who has the superpower of being extra ""easy"", unlike her ""no one was getting anywhere with her"" sibling (yeah, stated literally like that on film). She can fall in love at first sight with any man crossing her way. Be careful, because she also sings, cheesy and badly, like she's in a cabaret, or worse. ""For The First Time in Forever"" is an irking ode to adolescence's boiling hormones. Of course, she eventually manages to fall in love with a misogynous prince and kind of gets herself cursed (it seems the X-Elsa is also able to cast icy curses, even unwillingly, what is maybe the closest to Andersen's original plot that they managed to get).The rest is a wild ride of plot holes. For example, Elsa comes full fledged with Advanced Mathematics knowledge, being able not only to raise up a castle of pure ice (cf. Superman's Solitude Fortress), but to sing about ""frozen fractals"", all around. Even so, her people seem to be unable to build a wooden snow sledge that doesn't EXPLODE in the event of falling a few metres down a cliff... I mean, it was made of WOOD and blew up like it was carrying Napalm (what maybe it was, we don't actually know anything about Kristoff, he could be on Interpol's wanted list!)Talking about nonsense, why the ice started growing INSIDE the castle, chasing Easy Anna out, but stopped doing so outside, where it was surely much colder? If it was part of the curse, that was a very specific instalment. I mean, the ice shall grow around to kill her, but only in case she's in a castle...? Maybe it was just coincidence, the whole castle could be freezing, because the whole world was cooling down, but then again, it really looked colder outside than inside and I couldn't see much ice growing where Easy Anna was not, in that castle... Does any of that make any sense, at all...?And what was that about the sisters' childhood? So, one sister hurts the other while playing, so their parents take them apart, and erase one's memories?! Damn, why didn't I think of that when MY daughters hurt each other?! I mean, sure, it was an accident, but I could raise them apart, just to make sure they would never hurt themselves again. It's easier than trying to teach them to be nice and better persons. Makes sense, totally... What doesn't make sense is why Easy Anna didn't refreeze when she found out about her erased memories, if that was part of the treat (or ""treatment"") the trolls used on her... I think they just got ""trolled""!All in all, this show is a bad example in parenting and how logic doesn't fit in a Disney film. It's also a moral lesson on the dangers of young women being ""too cold"" or ""too easy""... Could it get any more sexist than that? Big hit by Disney, two princesses in one film. The only up side on it is ""Let It Go"", because it's likely the most exploitable song, ever! Let it blow, let it blow, like a sledge down the sno-oh-ow...","['aside', 'able', 'tell', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'poster', 'sister', 'side', 'side', 'knew', 'another', 'animate', 'musical', 'disney',

838,10,"Elsa, princess of Arendelle, possesses Cryokinesis, the magical ability to create ice and snow. One night while playing, she accidentally knocks out her younger sister, Anna. The king and queen seek help from trolls, who heal Anna and remove her memories of her sister's magic. The royal couple isolates the children in their castle until Elsa learns to control her powers. Afraid of hurting her sister again, Elsa spends most of her time alone in her room, causing a rift between the girls as they grow up. When the girls are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm. When Elsa comes of age, the kingdom prepares for her coronation. Among the guests is the Duke of Weselton, a tradesman seeking to exploit Arendelle for profit. Excited to be allowed out of the castle again, Anna explores the town and meets Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, and the two immediately develop a mutual attraction. Despite Elsa's fear, her coronation goes off without incident. During the reception, Hans proposes and Anna hastily accepts. However, Elsa refuses to grant her blessing and forbids their sudden marriage. The sisters argue, culminating in an emotional Elsa's abilities being exposed. Panicking, Elsa flees the palace, inadvertently unleashing an eternal winter on the kingdom in the process. High in the nearby mountains, she casts off restraint, building herself a solitary ice palace, and unknowingly brings to life her and Anna's childhood snowman, Olaf. Meanwhile, Anna sets out in search of her sister, determined to return her to Arendelle, end the winter, and mend their relationship. While getting supplies, she meets mountain man Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. She convinces him to guide her up the North Mountain. The group then encounters Olaf, who leads them to Elsa's hideaway. Anna and Elsa reunite, but Elsa still fears hurting her sister. When Anna persists in persuading her sister to return, Elsa becomes agitated and accidentally strikes Anna in the heart with her powers. Horrified, she creates a giant snow creature to run the friends away before she accidentally hurts anyone again. As they flee, Kristoff notices Anna's hair is turning white, and deduces something is very wrong. He seeks help from his adoptive family of trolls, who explain that Anna's heart has been frozen. Unless it's thawed by an ""act of true love"", she will become frozen solid forever. Believing that only Hans can save her, Kristoff races back with her to Arendelle. Meanwhile, Hans, leading a search for Anna, reaches Elsa's palace. In the ensuing battle against the Duke's men, she is knocked unconscious and imprisoned back at the kingdom. There, Hans pleads with her to undo the winter, but Elsa confesses she doesn't know how. When Anna reunites with Hans and begs him to kiss her to break the curse, Hans refuses and reveals that his true intention in marrying her is to seize control of Arendelle's throne. Leaving Anna to die, he charges Elsa with treason for her younger sister's apparent death. Elsa escapes and heads out into the blizzard on the fjord. Olaf finds Anna and reveals Kristoff is in love with her. The two then rush onto the fjord to find him. Hans confronts Elsa and tells her Anna is dead because of her. In Elsa's despair, the storm suddenly ceases, giving Kristoff and Anna the chance to reach each other. However, when Anna sees that Hans is about to kill Elsa, she throws herself between the two and subsequently freezes solid, blocking the blow, knocking Hans off his feet and rendering him unconscious when he hits his head on the icy surface. As Elsa grieves for her sister, Anna's decision to sacrifice herself to save Elsa constitutes an ""act of true love"" and thaws her. Realizing love is the key to controlling her powers, Elsa is able to thaw the kingdom and even helps Olaf survive in summer. Hans is sent back to the Southern Isles to face punishment for his crimes against the royal family of Arendelle, and Elsa cuts off trade with Weselton. Anna and Kristoff share a kiss, and the two sisters reconcile, with Elsa promising never to shut the castle gates again.","['elsa', 'princess', 'arendelle', 'posse', 'cryokinesis', 'magical',

839,4,"The animation is the strong point of this. It was fantastic. Really incredible that truly made me forget it was animation at times. The music had one semi memorable song, and it takes a Broadway star to make it that strong. The score and other songs were middle of the line to almost boring. Most important to me, I seriously cannot tell you what the lesson was from this film. I have a 6 year old daughter, and I have seen them ALL. I was an English major, finding themes etc... comes pretty easy to me. Even the weakest Disney film has a moral/lesson. This film never quite finds itself. Shallow characters, rushed plot, no defined villain, all create a plodding film with a few moments of humor, fewer of drama, and minimal warmth. I suggest waiting for streaming or bluray. It almost seems like Disney new this was a weaker one because the marketing support has not been there either.","['animation', 'strong', 'point', 'fantastic', 'really', 'incredible', 'truly', 'make', 'forget', 'animation', 'time', 'music', 'one', 'semi', 'memorable', 'song', 'take', 'broadway', 'star', 'make', 'strong', 'score', 'song', 'middle', 'line', 'almost', 'boring', 'important', 'seriously', 'tell', 'lesson', 'film', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'see', 'english', 'major', 'find', 'theme', 'etc', 'come', 'pretty', 'easy', 'even', 'weak', 'disney', 'film', 'moral', 'lesson', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'find', 'shallow', 'character', 'rush', 'plot', 'define', 'villain', 'create', 'plod', 'film', 'moment', 'humor', 'drama', 'minimal', 'warmth', 'suggest', 'wait', 'stream', 'bluray', 'almost', 'seem', 'like', 'disney', 'new', 'weaker', 'one', 'marketing', 'support', 'either']","[21, 167, 117, 253, 22, 549, 329, 14, 746, 21, 20, 58, 10, 2746, 268, 11, 55, 411, 249, 14, 167, 223, 11, 962, 213, 173, 370, 289, 667, 143, 499, 3, 47, 64, 389, 16, 2246, 823, 71, 226, 430, 40, 136, 454, 28, 434, 2, 3, 551, 499, 3, 88, 124, 71, 1664, 8, 525, 52, 1206, 104, 134, 3, 133, 222, 745, 1939, 1324, 1049, 415, 3279, 3637, 173, 75, 9, 2, 108, 2413, 10, 1387, 740, 353]"

842,10,"Now acclaimed as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, Disney's 2013 film Frozen—inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's short story ""The Snow Queen""—is an innocent tale centered around the story of sisters Anna and Elsa. Frozen features the voices of Kristen Bell as Anna, Idina Menzel as Elsa, Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, Josh Gad as Olaf, and Santino Fontana as Hans. In the film, Elsa's unique and supernatural abilities isolated her from everyone and caused a rift between her and her sister, Anna, after an unfortunate incident in their youth that endangered Anna's life. When Elsa's power is revealed to everyone in the kingdom, she runs away and it is up to Anna, with the assistance of Hans, Kristoff, and Olaf, to bring her back in order to save the kingdom and her sister from isolation and ultimately renew their bonds. The plot was unique and different, even if compared to the many collections of Disney animated films, which made the plot developments less predictable. Unlike other Disney animated films, Frozen featured two Disney princesses which happened to be sisters, two leading men: a prince charming and an ice merchant, and a talking and singing snowman instead of a talking animal (Kristoff's reindeer does not talk). The plot's resolution is also quite unexpected and gave a new meaning to the clichéd Disney phrase ""an act of true love.""Although animated, the film can easily be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. The familiar themes of love, friendship, isolation, and ambition that surrounded the animated characters made these characters much more familiar and human. The combination of fantasy and reality makes the film so much more interesting with Disney's spectacularly realistic visual and sound effects and the excellently written and performed original soundtrack. The film immediately opens with a song—""Frozen Heart""—sung by a crew of ice merchants as they are shown collecting and breaking ice; the ice looked so real and the sounds of the breaking ice was perfectly integrated with the visual. The film's heartfelt songs such as Anna's ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"", Elsa's ""Let It Go"", Kristoff's ""Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People"", and Olaf's ""In Summer"", complemented the personalities of the characters and thus made them even more lovable. Overall, the film is very enjoyable and I cannot think of anything that was not good about it. It is one of those films that surely will join the ranks of unforgettable Disney classics such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, and Aladdin and forever claim a special place in the heart of its captivated audience.","['acclaim', 'high', 'gross', 'animate', 'film', 'time', 'disney', 'film', 'frozen', 'inspire', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'short', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'innocent', 'tale', 'center', 'around', 'story', 'sister', 'anna', 'elsa', 'frozen', 'feature', 'voice', 'kristen', 'bell', 'anna', 'idina', 'menzel', 'elsa', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'kristoff', 'josh', 'gad', 'olaf', 'santino', 'fontana', 'han', 'film', 'elsa', 'unique', 'supernatural', 'ability', 'isolated', 'everyone', 'cause', 'rift', 'sister', 'anna', 'unfortunate', 'incident', 'youth', 'endanger', 'anna', 'life', 'elsa', 'power', 'reveal', 'everyone', 'kingdom', 'run', 'away', 'anna', 'assistance', 'han', 'kristoff', 'olaf', 'bring', 'back', 'order', 'save', 'kingdom', 'sister', 'isolation', 'ultimately', 'renew', 'bond', 'plot', 'unique', 'different', 'even', 'compare', 'many', 'collection', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'make', 'plot', 'development', 'less', 'predictable', 'unlike', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'frozen', 'feature', 'two', 'disney', 'princess', 'happen', 'sister', 'two', 'lead', 'men', 'prince', 'charm', 'ice', 'merchant', 'talk', 'sing', 'snowman', 'instead', 'talk', 'animal', 'kristoff', 'reindeer', 'talk', 'plot', 'resolution', 'also', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'give', 'new', 'meaning', 'clich', 'disney', 'phrase', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'although', 'animate', 'film', 'easily', 'enjoy', 'audience', 'age', 'familiar', 'theme', 'love', 'friendship', 'isolation', 'ambition', 'surround', 'animate', 'character', 'make', 'character', 'much', 'familiar', 'human', 'combination', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'make', 'film', 'much', 'interest', 'disney', 'spectacularly', 'realistic', 'visual', 'sound', 'effect', 'excellently', 'write', 'perform', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'immediately', 'open', 'song', 'frozen', 'heart', 'sung', 'crew', 'ice', 'merchant', 'show', 'collect', 'break', 'ice', 'ice', 'look', 'real', 'sound', 'break', 'ice', 'perfectly', 'integrate', 'visual', 'film', 'heartfelt', 'song', 'anna', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'elsa', 'let', 'go', 'kristoff', 'reindeer', 'well', 'people', 'olaf', 'summer', 'complement', 'personality', 'character', 'thus', 'make', 'even', 'lovable', 'overall', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'think', 'anything', 'good', 'one', 'film', 'surely', 'join', 'rank', 'unforgettable', 'disney', 'classic', 'cinderella', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'snow', 'white', 'seven', 'dwarf', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'aladdin', 'forever', 'claim', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'captivate', 'audience']","[1942, 206, 783, 38, 3, 20, 2, 3, 5, 500, 44, 245, 339, 263, 12, 39, 49, 1315, 114, 649, 200, 12, 15, 7, 4, 5, 229, 86, 162, 146, 7, 141, 116, 4, 455, 377, 67, 275, 257, 32, 688, 665, 44, 3, 4, 414, 3222, 367, 782, 109, 328, 2467, 15, 7, 1555, 1093, 2727, 3362, 7, 79, 4, 24, 528, 109, 77, 233, 101, 7, 3439, 44, 67, 32, 221, 74, 496, 111, 77, 15, 600, 941, 482, 52, 414, 140, 28, 350, 61, 1327, 2, 38, 3, 14, 52, 356, 321, 331, 766, 2, 38, 3, 5, 229, 42, 2, 29, 290, 15, 42, 248, 459, 82, 235, 33, 2220, 178, 63, 45, 208, 178, 876, 67, 151, 178, 52, 1098, 27, 124, 894, 57, 108, 672, 274, 2, 2989, 112, 62, 6, 255, 38, 3, 403, 91, 159, 139, 1077, 226, 6, 1003, 600, 2370, 1353, 38, 8, 14, 8, 31, 1077, 515, 1414, 545, 940, 14, 3, 31, 122, 2, 3845, 640, 450, 259, 278, 2201, 165, 1332, 230, 225, 3, 597, 318, 11, 5, 80, 684, 2267, 33, 2220, 78, 340, 33, 33, 66, 195, 259, 340, 33, 456, 3947, 450, 3, 1402, 11, 7, 59, 202, 45, 4, 30, 13, 67, 151, 18, 46, 32, 205, 2715, 407, 8, 1348, 14, 28, 726, 166, 3, 306, 37, 212, 17, 10, 3, 960, 813, 1468, 1510, 2, 69, 854, 1090, 149, 39, 365, 1721, 1573, 149, 203, 152, 97, 485, 287, 1042, 316, 188, 80, 1024, 159]"

844,9,"When Princess Elsa nearly kills her younger sister Anna by careless use of her magical freezing powers, the King and Queen react by magically erasing Anna's memory, and raising Elsa in isolation. When the sisters meet again at Elsa's coronation, her powers again wreak havoc, and she runs away to live in isolation where she can't hurt anyone. But Anna follows, to try to persuade her to return for she has left her realm in the grip of a never-ending winter.Inspired by, but not based on, Hans Andersen's The Snow Queen, Frozen is an original fairytale delivered in the same manner as Tangled - traditional Disney fare, but with computer animation rather than traditional hand-drawn animation, albeit anyone watching it will not be surprised to see characters which could have sprung from Cinderalla, Sleeping Beauty et al. Many of the better CGI movies reflect strides made in modelling one particular area and, with Frozen that is, not surprisingly, snow and ice. In fact, much of this film is breathtakingly beautiful as regards how full use is made of the possibilities which CGI opens up to the animators. The 3D is also very good. The film is a treat for the eyes.Which is not to short-change the story. Unusually, there is no formal villain as such: what we have is an antagonist who causes harm but does not wish to: a potentially tragic character and, in fact, the opening sequence is a wistful and sad opening to family fare, not that Disney has ever shied away from making hard choices in storytelling. The two sisters are nicely realised, as are the two handsome young men, and also the comedy relief reindeer and snowman. Pleasingly, the voice talent is relatively low profile, but they do very well.The story carries no major surprises (but one or two minor ones), and remains pleasing. I felt it didn't have quite as much heart as Tangled, but there were still moments when it brought a tear to the eye, whether through a story moment or simply because something is jaw-droppingly beautiful to look at.Recommended.","['princess', 'elsa', 'nearly', 'kill', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'careless', 'use', 'magical', 'freeze', 'power', 'king', 'queen', 'react', 'magically', 'erase', 'anna', 'memory', 'raise', 'elsa', 'isolation', 'sister', 'meet', 'elsa', 'coronation', 'power', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'run', 'away', 'live', 'isolation', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'anna', 'follow', 'try', 'persuade', 'return', 'left', 'realm', 'grip', 'never', 'end', 'winter', 'inspire', 'base', 'han', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'frozen', 'original', 'fairytale', 'deliver', 'manner', 'tangle', 'traditional', 'disney', 'fare', 'computer', 'animation', 'rather', 'traditional', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'albeit', 'anyone', 'watch', 'surprised', 'see', 'character', 'could', 'sprung', 'cinderalla', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'et', 'al', 'many', 'well', 'cgi', 'movie', 'reflect', 'stride', 'make', 'model', 'one', 'particular', 'area', 'frozen', 'surprisingly', 'snow', 'ice', 'fact', 'much', 'film', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'regard', 'full', 'use', 'make', 'possibility', 'cgi', 'open', 'animator', 'also', 'good', 'film', 'treat', 'eye', 'short', 'change', 'story', 'unusually', 'formal', 'villain', 'antagonist', 'cause', 'harm', 'wish', 'potentially', 'tragic', 'character', 'fact', 'opening', 'sequence', 'wistful', 'sad', 'opening', 'family', 'fare', 'disney', 'ever', 'shy', 'away', 'make', 'hard', 'choice', 'storytelling', 'two', 'sister', 'nicely', 'realise', 'two', 'handsome', 'young', 'men', 'also', 'comedy', 'relief', 'reindeer', 'snowman', 'pleasingly', 'voice', 'talent', 'relatively', 'low', 'profile', 'well', 'story', 'carry', 'major', 'surprise', 'one', 'two', 'minor', 'one', 'remains', 'please', 'felt', 'quite', 'much', 'heart', 'tangle', 'still', 'moment', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', 'whether', 'story', 'moment', 'simply', 'something', 'jaw', 'droppingly', 'beautiful', 'look', 'recommend']","[29, 4, 501, 286, 73, 15, 7, 4237, 158, 170, 282, 24, 97, 49, 2114, 1663, 972, 7, 412, 760, 4, 600, 15, 244, 4, 343, 24, 5075, 5076, 233, 101, 224, 600, 305, 299, 7, 378, 87, 3945, 385, 330, 3214, 2101, 88, 41, 105, 500, 256, 44, 339, 39, 49, 5, 230, 756, 1050, 1377, 83, 462, 2, 1591, 642, 21, 191, 462, 323, 747, 21, 2277, 299, 23, 703, 16, 8, 54, 4488, 1090, 149, 3087, 4734, 61, 18, 555, 1, 1384, 2795, 14, 753, 10, 650, 1266, 5, 1179, 39, 33, 201, 31, 3, 3262, 93, 902, 246, 158, 14, 2123, 555, 318, 812, 27, 17, 3, 682, 336, 263, 209, 12, 3842, 5077, 104, 634, 328, 709, 417, 2166, 1493, 8, 201, 631, 502, 579, 631, 72, 1591, 2, 81, 2897, 101, 14, 307, 862, 689, 42, 15, 1231, 1544, 42, 739, 73, 459, 27, 279, 297, 151, 45, 86, 800, 1688, 1023, 4907, 18, 12, 853, 823, 445, 10, 42, 670, 10, 1550, 576, 155, 124, 31, 80, 83, 68, 133, 599, 748, 336, 638, 12, 133, 341, 89, 2342, 4211, 93, 66, 262]"

The way they made Anna have great relationship with Hans and then while engaged with him put her in with another ""great guy"" Sven, added a superb dynamic which keeps you guessing and rooting for one of the two guys. Plus the sister is single so, one of the guys could end up with the queen.. That was great. One of the only movies where you actually don't know how it will pan out. The jokes and funny bits were done masterfully! Lots of good laughs throughout the movie!The story is also good. But unfortunately the last part of the movie just solved all of the problems way too quickly and it didn't make sense. 1) The way Hans turned from good to bad, made no sense at all. He could easily kill the queen, but actually saved her life, only to then turn on Anna and go back and try to kill the queen...2) How the whole winter situation got resolved and turned into summer could be done better..

846,3,"*** Spoiler Alert ***Having been fooled by all the rave reviews on IMDb into seeing Frozen in the theater, my take is that it is not a great movie, and it isn't even a good movie. It is not nearly as good as either The Beauty and the Beast or Tangled. Many reviewers here gently refer to the movie's flaws, but the flaws are basic and pervasive. Elsa is the sister with the curse of freezing everything she touches, but we don't spend enough time with her. We spend most our time with Anna, Elsa's normal sister. So we don't get inside Elsa's character, we don't see her try to learn to control her powers, we don't see her evolve. If Elsa's problem is that she freezes everything when she gets mad, why isn't she working on emotional control with a wizened therapist, rather than walling herself up in an ice castle? (Contrast with Beauty and the Beast, where the beast's evolution is at the center of the movie.) The road trip at the center of the movie is pleasant enough, but it does not move the story along at all. There are many things that don't make sense. Why is there a snow monster (created by Elsa) who is trying to kill everyone, when supposedly Elsa and Anna love each other? At movie's end, the resolution of Elsa's problem and the town's problem is so sudden, simple, obvious and sappy that you wonder why these bright sisters didn't think of it in the first 10 minutes of the movie, rather than in the last 5. This movie is really OK for age 5 and under. Anyone older than that will be dissatisfied by the movie's incoherence. As for all the glowing reviews on IMDb, I'm wondering if those reviewers saw a different movie, or if Disney has figured out how to ensure positive, revenue-generating Internet buzz for its creations.My recommendation is to wait until you can watch the movie at home, so you can go get yourself a sandwich during the annoying songs, a salad during the slow parts, and some ice cream during the parts that make no sense. Then you won't feel foolish like me for spending real money to see it in the theater.","['spoiler', 'alert', 'fool', 'rave', 'review', 'imdb', 'see', 'frozen', 'theater', 'take', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'good', 'movie', 'nearly', 'good', 'either', 'beauty', 'beast', 'tangle', 'many', 'reviewer', 'gently', 'refer', 'movie', 'flaw', 'flaw', 'basic', 'pervasive', 'elsa', 'sister', 'curse', 'freeze', 'everything', 'touch', 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'spend', 'time', 'anna', 'elsa', 'normal', 'sister', 'get', 'inside', 'elsa', 'character', 'see', 'try', 'learn', 'control', 'power', 'see', 'evolve', 'elsa', 'problem', 'freeze', 'everything', 'get', 'mad', 'work', 'emotional', 'control', 'wizened', 'therapist', 'rather', 'wall', 'ice', 'castle', 'contrast', 'beauty', 'beast', 'beast', 'evolution', 'center', 'movie', 'road', 'trip', 'center', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'many', 'thing', 'make', 'sense', 'snow', 'monster', 'create', 'elsa', 'try', 'kill', 'everyone', 'supposedly', 'elsa', 'anna', 'love', 'movie', 'end', 'resolution', 'elsa', 'problem', 'town', 'problem', 'sudden', 'simple', 'obvious', 'sappy', 'wonder', 'bright', 'sister', 'think', 'first', 'minute', 'movie', 'rather', 'last', 'movie', 'really', 'ok', 'age', 'anyone', 'old', 'dissatisfied', 'movie', 'incoherence', 'glow', 'review', 'imdb', 'wonder', 'reviewer', 'saw', 'different', 'movie', 'disney', 'figure', 'ensure', 'positive', 'revenue', 'generate', 'internet', 'buzz', 'creation', 'recommendation', 'wait', 'watch', 'movie', 'home', 'go', 'get', 'sandwich', 'annoy', 'song', 'salad', 'slow', 'part', 'ice', 'cream', 'part', 'make', 'sense', 'feel', 'foolish', 'like', 'spending', 'real', 'money', 'see', 'theater']","[419, 1741, 1959, 2224, 161, 866, 16, 5, 312, 55, 25, 1, 28, 17, 1, 501, 17, 353, 149, 203, 83, 61, 1198, 2064, 1, 386, 386, 1088, 4, 15, 405, 282, 132, 260, 1031, 164, 20, 1031, 20, 7, 4, 873, 15, 19, 882, 4, 8, 16, 87, 347, 128, 24, 16, 3623, 4, 198, 282, 132, 19, 1314, 107, 342, 128, 191, 1201, 33, 168, 956, 149, 203, 203, 3571, 649, 1, 1734, 1066, 649, 1, 978, 164, 242, 12, 172, 61, 43, 14, 217, 39, 495, 134, 4, 87, 286, 109, 1290, 4, 7, 6, 1, 41, 1098, 4, 198, 602, 198, 1072, 516, 595, 2175, 532, 1425, 15, 37, 36, 211, 1, 191, 197, 1, 22, 477, 139, 299, 64, 1, 2186, 161, 866, 532, 1198, 157, 140, 1, 2, 630, 2838, 503, 3228, 1286, 1720, 2017, 1075, 3203, 415, 23, 1, 533, 13, 19, 3053, 238, 11, 1065, 94, 33, 3948, 94, 14, 217, 53, 2901, 9, 1407, 195, 661, 16, 312]"
847,10,"As a 90's child, I have grown up watching all of the Disney movies. Frozen, the most recent Disney success is meant to redefine the definition of ""true love"" that all the other Disney films have created. It also teaches hidden lessons to children such as: get to know someone before making any big decisions, a disability is not a curse no matter how bad it seems, and that hiding from your problems does not make them any easier to deal with. This movie was extravagant and included some of the best songs I have heard in all my years of watching Disney films. The movie is based on a fictional location called the kingdom of Arendelle. Arendelle is ran by a family of four a king, queen, and their two daughters Elsa and Anna. Elsa, the older sister, has this magical ability to create ice and snow. Anna is the younger sister who is very energetic and full of life. The kids begin their childhood not knowing anything but each other, and then the two are forced to spend time apart out of a fear of Elsa's powers harming her sister. The two girls reunite at Elsa's coronation about ten years after they are split up. The two girls are excited to see each other, but Elsa is still fearful and Anna is ready to explore and rebuild a relationship with her sister. The two girls get in an argument and Elsa flees to the mountains. Anna goes after her and meets a mountain man Kristoff, who guides her up the mountain to her sister's hideaway. Anna reaches Elsa, but Elsa's fear of harming her sister becomes reality. Anna becomes ill and goes back down the mountain to get to her kingdom. Elsa is captured and brought back to Arendelle as a criminal. Elsa gets scared and escapes captivity using her skills. The main characters find themselves out on the frozen water searching for one another. By the end Elsa figures out how to control her powers and the hope of the sisters' relationship is restored. I'm going to be honest, I'm a guy in college and Frozen seemed a little too childish for me to go see, so I waited till my little sister made me watch it with her. The film immediately captured my attention with a heart-wrenching back story and I soon realized that this film was much deeper than the commercials and advertisements. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Even on parts that were not meant to be so exciting I was captivated by some aspect of the film. This film was all inclusive and politically correct as well as telling a deep story. The political correctness comes from an encounter Anna has with the store owner and his family on her journey up the mountain. The store owner was a bit feminine and when the film flashed to give the viewer of his family, the viewer saw another big guy surrounded by little girls. The older audience caught on that the big guy in the back was his husband and the girls were ""their"" children. There is no other film that is this deep, politically correct, and this sound. Frozen is also one of a kind when it comes to the expertise in the musical soundtrack to the film. The film always had a song to go with the emotional parts and kept the audience's attention by captivating them with songs. The film taught many lessons, but there are three in which I personally found. The lesson of getting to know someone before making any decisions comes with Anna and Prince Hans ""falling in love"". Anna became really upset with Elsa when she said no to their marriage, but by the end, Anna had fallen in love with a completely other man. Another lesson that came to my mind was that a disability is not a curse no matter how bad it seems. This lesson is learned throughout the movie as Elsa learns to use her ""powers"" to her advantage and figures out how to control them. Just as if a man with a vision impairment was not able to see, but when he learns to use his other four senses in a way in which others cannot, then he is at an advantage to normal people versus being able to use all five in the average way. The last lesson I obtained in my time watching this film would be that hiding from your problems does not make those problems any easier to deal with. As Elsa was locked in her room for over 10 years she was unable to find out how to control her powers around others because she was afraid of hurting anyone. That is like a kid being afraid of a roller coaster but will not try it to see what it is really like. In all, there are many lessons taught throughout this movie and this is barely a scratch upon the surface.Frozen is a fantastic and lesson-filled film that is perfect for people of all ages! Personally, I have not seen a movie that is more beneficial to someone than this one. Despite its sad back story and troubled relationships, this film has a source of positive power that is stronger than the power of the down beats. By the end of the film, the viewer is beyond happy and has this nagging urge to watch it again. I encourage you to go see it for yourself if you have not already done so. This is a movie unlike any other; do not be a skeptic like me, open yourself up to Disney, no matter your age.","['child', 'grown', 'watch', 'disney', 'movie', 'frozen', 'recent', 'disney', 'success',

848,10,"The Brilliance of FrozenThis isn't a review so much as it is a homage. I loved this movie almost as much as my 5 year old, but, clearly, for different reasons. It's a good, fresh story, good songs, gorgeous visuals, and a great message if you look for it. [===== SPOILERS - DON'T READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE ===== ]The crucial moment in Frozen is when princess Ana searches for true love - for only an act of true love can save her from a frozen heart. She searches wide and far - first for prince Hans, but it turns out he doesn't love her. Then for Christoph - surely this good man can save her! He is all too happy to try. But as she is waiting for him to run across the ice and save her life with a kiss of true love, she sees her sister in moral danger. In an act of true love, putting her sister before her own interest, her own life even, she runs over and stops the sword of Hans. With this act of true love, she cures her own frozen heart.We learn that true love is not something to seek out; it's not something coming to you from the outside, like a knight in shining armor. True love is something to give. Something you have inside of you, and something you must give to cure your own frozen heart.Kind of deep for an animated kids movie.Disclaimer: My five year old son loves Frozen. it's his favorite film. He repeatedly tried to get us to buy him a Frozen dress. I wonder why Disney doesn't make Frozen branded clothing for boys - seems like a missed opportunity. I am not sure it's the visuals, or the song, or the message that makes him love the movie so much. Probably all of them.","['brilliance', 'frozenthis', 'review', 'much', 'homage', 'love', 'movie', 'almost', 'much', 'year', 'old', 'clearly', 'different', 'reason', 'good', 'fresh', 'story', 'good', 'song', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'great', 'message', 'look', 'spoiler', 'read', 'far', 'unless', 'see', 'movie', 'crucial', 'moment', 'frozen', 'princess', 'ana', 'search', 'true', 'love', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'frozen', 'heart', 'search', 'wide', 'far', 'first', 'prince', 'han', 'turn', 'love', 'christoph', 'surely', 'good', 'man', 'save', 'happy', 'try', 'wait', 'run', 'across', 'ice', 'save', 'life', 'kiss', 'true', 'love', 'see', 'sister', 'moral', 'danger', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'put', 'sister', 'interest', 'life', 'even', 'run', 'stop', 'sword', 'han', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'cure', 'frozen', 'heart', 'learn', 'true', 'love', 'something', 'seek', 'something', 'come', 'outside', 'like', 'knight', 'shin', 'armor', 'true', 'love', 'something', 'give', 'something', 'inside', 'something', 'must', 'give', 'cure', 'frozen', 'heart', 'kind', 'deep', 'animate', 'kid', 'movie', 'disclaimer', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'love', 'frozen', 'favorite', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'try', 'get', 'u', 'buy', 'frozen', 'dress', 'wonder', 'disney', 'make', 'frozen', 'brand', 'clothing', 'boy', 'seem', 'like', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'sure', 'visuals', 'song', 'message', 'make', 'love', 'movie', 'much', 'probably']","[2014, 161, 31, 2902, 6, 1, 173, 31, 47, 64, 690, 140, 180, 17, 819, 12, 17, 11, 444, 267, 25, 185, 66, 419, 547, 142, 959, 16, 1, 3249, 133, 5, 29, 929, 793, 62, 6, 112, 62, 6, 111, 5, 80, 793, 1226, 142, 36, 82, 44, 113, 6, 1808, 960, 17, 145, 111, 301, 87, 415, 233, 1168, 33, 111, 79, 372, 62, 6, 16, 15, 551, 901, 112, 62, 6, 196, 15, 122, 79, 28, 233, 284, 1277, 44, 112, 62, 6, 1256, 5, 80, 347, 62, 6, 89, 997, 89, 40, 769, 9, 3201, 2034, 3725, 62, 6, 89, 57, 89, 882, 89, 236, 57, 1256, 5, 80, 193, 574, 38, 60, 1, 3922, 731, 47, 64, 1269, 6, 5, 189, 3, 2872, 87, 19, 177, 948, 5, 907, 532, 2, 14, 5, 1545, 2136, 408, 75, 9, 271, 759, 207, 267, 11, 185, 14, 6, 1, 31, 210]"
849,9,"This is an animated feature done by Disney Animation Studios. There will be spoilers ahead:Disney has been making animated feature-length films since 1937, with more than 50 done by the Disney Animation Studios through Frozen, in addition to now owning Pixar and having distribution on others. In recent years, Disney Animation Studios, while doing fairly good work, has been overshadowed by Pixar and Studio Ghibli. Frozen is the best animated film DAS has done since probably Aladdin in 1992.With Frozen, DAS takes Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" and gives it the Disney treatment. Frozen is incredibly successful on so many levels. It works as a full-blown musical, with a fine score and a very catchy hit song, ""Let It Go"". The animation is fantastic, it's the funniest animated film the studio has done in years.The characters are mostly well-designed and the voice work (spoken and sung) is equally exceptional for the most part. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, as Anna and Elsa respectively, are the leads and the heart of the story. It's essential that they do well or the film will sink. Their performances are fantastic.Beyond the two leads, there are a couple of romantic sub-plots and a couple of characters set up to be the comic relief. One of the love interests, Kristoff, has a reindeer named Sven and their interactions are fairly funny for the most part. Olaf the snowman is okay. He works better for kids than he does for me.Anna and Elsa are sisters who are also Princesses (naturally-this is a Disney film, after all). Elsa, the older sister, has the power to produce snow, ice and frost, which is a two-edged gift. After an accident, she and her sister fall apart, largely due to Elsa's fears that she will accidentally harm Anna.On Elsa's coronation upon her coming of age, various problems rear their heads and Elsa flees the palace, determined to exile herself. Anna pursues her sister, equally determined to fix whatever has come between them and make things whole and right, like they were when the girls were close.Through various travails and setbacks, the bad guy(s) are exposed, the sisters regain their close relationship and various mysteries are resolved. All the elements Disney films typically have are present, with a script strong enough to carry it all to a satisfying conclusion.I must admit that I like The Wind Rises a bit more than I do Frozen, but that's like saying I like chocolate ice cream more than I like fudge ripple. Both are wonderful, as is Ernest and Celestine. Those three, along with Despicable Me 2 and The Croods, form the nominees for the Animated Feature Academy Award, with Frozen winning.This film is available on Blu-Ray and DVD and is well worth having.

850,9,"The movie is about two sisters Anna and Elsa and how the older one, Elsa, is troubled with her ability to make ice and snow and freeze things. Elsa doesn't know how to control her powers and ultimately has to find ways to hide who she truly is her entire life. When Elsa gets exposed in front of her entire kingdom she leave accidentally creating an everlasting winter during the summer. It is up to Anna to make the adventure into the freezing conditions to find her sister and bring back summer. Along the way Anna encounters a ice man named Kristoff who is gentle at heart and his sidekick reindeer Sven who both end up helping her through her journey. My favorite character is a sweet little gullible Snowman named Olaf who just wants to help and experience all of the joys of life. The movie is a sweet musical with plenty of catchy tunes and comic relief for the grown ups and the children.

852,9,"""Do you wanna build a snowman?"" After watching this movie, you'll definitely want to. Frozen revolves around two princess sisters, their love for each other and their kingdom. There is an imaginative beauty in the whole film – right from the snow covered Arendelle to the high North mountain and the magnificent snow castle.Frozen is a musical movie, as some would say. At some places, the characters talk to themselves and others through songs. The songs in the movie have the power of revealing the thoughts of the characters through words – be it Anna's 'For the First Time in Forever' or Elsa's 'Let it Go'. The movie has both hilarious as well as emotional aspects. While many dialogs make you laugh, some can make you ponder over them for sometime. It shows Elsa's lonely childhood and Anna's uneasiness due to the sudden drifting of Elsa away from her. There also lies a remarkable twist as the story deviates from the usual 'act of true love' plot line. Half way through the movie and there comes Olaf – the funny, little, loving and charming snowman who likes warm hugs – yet another of Disney's amazing creations which make children fall for them. He gives a new edge to the fun factor of the movie through his fragile body as well as his innocence. Rather than focusing only on the main character Elsa and her woes in concealing her powers, the movie also has space for other important characters – Anna, Kristoff and Olaf. Overall, Frozen is an utterly satisfying movie - a comedy-adventure flick which is good in all fronts having great visuals, awesome music, good plot and amusing characters. I loved the movie. It took me back to my childhood days. In my personal opinion, I would rate it as 9/10.","['wan', 'build', 'snowman', 'watch', 'movie', 'definitely', 'want', 'frozen', 'revolves', 'around', 'two', 'princess', 'sister', 'love', 'kingdom', 'imaginative', 'beauty', 'whole', 'film', 'right', 'snow', 'cover', 'arendelle', 'high', 'north', 'mountain', 'magnificent', 'snow', 'castle', 'frozen', 'musical', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'place', 'character', 'talk', 'others', 'song', 'song', 'movie', 'power', 'reveal', 'thought', 'character', 'word', 'anna', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'elsa', 'let', 'go', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'well', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'many', 'dialog', 'make', 'laugh', 'make', 'ponder', 'sometime', 'show', 'elsa', 'lonely', 'childhood', 'anna', 'uneasiness', 'due', 'sudden', 'drift', 'elsa', 'away', 'also', 'lie', 'remarkable', 'twist', 'story', 'deviate', 'usual', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'plot', 'line', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'come', 'olaf', 'funny', 'little', 'love', 'charm', 'snowman', 'like', 'warm', 'hug', 'yet', 'another', 'disney', 'amaze', 'creation', 'make', 'child', 'fall', 'give', 'new', 'edge', 'fun', 'factor', 'movie', 'fragile', 'body', 'well', 'innocence', 'rather', 'focus', 'main', 'character', 'elsa', 'woe', 'conceal', 'power', 'movie', 'also', 'space', 'important', 'character', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'olaf', 'overall', 'frozen', 'utterly', 'satisfy', 'movie', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'flick', 'good', 'front', 'great', 'visuals', 'awesome', 'music', 'good', 'plot', 'amuse', 'character', 'love', 'movie', 'take', 'back', 'childhood', 'day', 'personal', 'opinion', 'would', 'rate']","[779, 202, 45, 23, 1, 174, 59, 5, 2261, 200, 42, 29, 15, 6, 77, 2194, 149, 127, 3, 130, 39, 712, 199, 206, 1252, 214, 935, 39, 168, 5, 51, 1, 26, 35, 188, 8, 178, 247, 11, 11, 1, 24, 528, 92, 8, 548, 7, 36, 20, 287, 4, 30, 13, 1, 364, 18, 342, 443, 61, 1187, 14, 190, 14, 3015, 2903, 78, 4, 930, 466, 7, 404, 1072, 2395, 4, 101, 27, 1152, 1530, 129, 12, 3326, 562, 112, 62, 6, 52, 213, 346, 50, 1, 40, 32, 85, 48, 6, 235, 45, 9, 362, 1236, 182, 102, 2, 96, 1075, 14, 70, 186, 57, 108, 1068, 125, 945, 1, 4592, 1220, 18, 1694, 191, 261, 119, 8, 4, 5081, 1232, 24, 1, 27, 1628, 289, 8, 7, 67, 32, 166, 5, 1209, 1188, 1, 279, 326, 805, 17, 938, 25, 267, 338, 58, 17, 52, 828, 8, 6, 1, 55, 74, 466, 138, 537, 258, 26, 694]"
853,10,"I came into seeing Frozen without any expectations. The teaser of Olaf and Sven acting cute didn't help me wanting to watch this film any time soon. I love Disney animated films, but was weary here. I am glad I went in with no expectations. I was not let down after it ended; I was in love, and have been since I saw it in December.It has been years since I walked into a film and walked out in total awe and bliss and experiencing true magic. Frozen was the greatest Disney film and actually the best film I have seen in many many years. The film brought the viewer back to Disney's golden years. It has the princesses and the musical numbers. That is what Disney does best.The songs are beautiful and by far the best since Pocahontas/Hunchback. ""Let it Go"" brought a tear to my eyes and its message was crafted beautifully and shone through the film's greatest character: ELSA.The characters were immensely three-dimensional and each had their own unique charm. The more you view the film, the more detail you see in the background, the art, the characters, the writing/story itself. The film and its themes/plot/character development is deep and layered with so much. Fear was the message here and so was love between family and not just between a man/woman.Elsa stole the film. She was stunning from beginning to end. Never has there been a more beautiful and compelling female character. She suffered through so much to keep her sister happy and safe. Idina Menzel's voice was perfect for the young Queen; very soothing and soft. Her character was complicated and the most relatable, which is why I think she became (WAS) the true star and why she will be Frozen/Disney's main poster-child for years to come. Disney loves to make cute animal mascots, and some serve no purpose except for being cute like Pascal in Tangled, but Olaf was different. He served a huge purpose in the film (helping with the sisters bond and being created from Elsa's true love for Anna) and was not just a goofy sidekick.There is humor throughout but the film succeeds with its touching, heart-felt story of two sisters (Anna and Elsa) and the bond they have. Frozen deserves its 2 Oscar wins and all the records it has broken and will continue to break. It deserves to be the highest grossing animated film ever and Disney's biggest success ever. The first musical/female directed film/WDAS film to earn $1 billion at the box-office is a monumental achievement. Plus, it went 12 weeks in the domestic top 5. Films rarely last more than 5-6 weeks in the top 5. Amazing! I hope a sequel happens and happens soon (and done right).Truly the best film of 2013 and possibly the best film in the past 20 years.

855,9,"I know I am going to get a lot of hate on this post but I just don't understand the point of this film. Honestly the story line to me was weak and boring until the last half hour of the movie and by then I wanted to shut it off. The beginning when their mother and father take Anna to the Love Trolls or whatever they are supposed to be called, I don't know why they were forced to erase her memory and keep Elsa basically in solitary confinement and why she could not even talk to Anna. Yes, I know these scenes created everybody's favorite song,""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman"" but it all seems dumb to me. I was extremely disappointed because I usually love to watch random Disney movies when I am bored and have nothing better to do and considering this movie has such high praise in social media, the news and by major movie critics, I decided to watch the film for myself. The ending, or the climax, was the best part of the movie in which I thought the exchanges between Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff were cute and adorable. The two characters that saved the filmed were Olaf and Sven. Without their goofy antics throughout the film, the movie would be just plain boring and not worth watching.Before everyone says I am a grouchy old lady, I just turned 18 and I still act like a 5 year old. I just know the difference between a good Disney movie and a bad Disney movie. I think Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave and if he oversaw this movie, it probably would not have been realized as it was in the theatrical version. Again, I know many families and children LOVE this film, but I am entitled to my opinion and I thought this movie was terrible.By the way, my all time favorite Disney movie is either The Little Mermaid, or 101 Dalmations because I love animals, LOL. Once again, I am sorry if I am offending you die hard Frozen fans.PLEASE do not give me hurtful hate because I am SENSITIVE and will cry myself to sleep. ;)PS. Disney is turning to crap.

Elsa possesses a magical ability to create ice and snow, but unfortunately after an accident endangers the life of Anna, Elsa locks herself away in her bedroom, growing up alone. Elsa eventually appears but only for her coronation. However, after a series of events trap the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter, Elsa runs away.

Together, they set out to find Elsa so that they can help her and restore Arendelle back to normal.We've come to expect the animation in Disney movies to be excellent, but it's definitely something to behold in Frozen, especially on Blu-ray. Everything is crystal clear and amazing to watch, especially the vast winter landscapes the movie is set in. The animation, as stunning as it was, isn't everything though, and Frozen had the danger of being one of the most boring Disney films I had seen because of the amount of musical numbers that are in the 1st half of the movie. I enjoy old classic Disney movies that have musical numbers in them like The Jungle Book, The Aristocats, and The Lion King, but they weren't overloaded with musical numbers like Frozen. Thankfully, the musical numbers become few and far between and this is when the movie got MUCH better.The movie has very likable characters with the classic comic relief part coming in the form of a snowman named Olaf. The voice cast do a good job and all work well together and there isn't really one annoying voice/character to put you off. It's just a pity, with all of the positives that the movie had in the 2nd half of the movie, along with the animation throughout, that it wasn't this strong to start with because if the song numbers were kept down then this could easily have been one of the best animated movies from the last few years.Frozen was good but could have been so much better.","['frozen', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'elsa', 'anna', 'extremely', 'close', 'child', 'elsa', 'posse', 'magical', 'ability', 'create', 'ice', 'snow', 'unfortunately', 'accident', 'endangers', 'life', 'anna', 'elsa', 'lock', 'away', 'bedroom', 'grow', 'alone', 'elsa', 'eventually', 'appear', 'coronation', 'however', 'series', 'event', 'trap', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'eternal', 'winter', 'elsa', 'run', 'away', 'anna', 'set', 'find', 'sister', 'along', 'way', 'meet', 'kristoff', 'trusty', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'together', 'set', 'find', 'elsa', 'help', 'restore', 'arendelle', 'back', 'normal', 'come', 'expect', 'animation', 'disney', 'movie', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'something', 'behold', 'frozen', 'especially', 'blu', 'ray', 'everything', 'crystal', 'clear', 'amaze', 'watch', 'especially', 'vast', 'winter', 'landscape', 'movie', 'set', 'animation', 'stun', 'everything', 'though', 'frozen', 'danger', 'one', 'boring', 'disney', 'film', 'see', 'amount', 'musical', 'number', 'st', 'half', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'old', 'classic', 'disney', 'movie', 'musical', 'number', 'like', 'jungle', 'book', 'aristocats', 'lion', 'king', 'overload', 'musical', 'number', 'like', 'frozen', 'thankfully', 'musical', 'number', 'become', 'far', 'movie', 'get', 'much', 'well', 'movie', 'likable', 'character', 'classic', 'comic', 'relief', 'part', 'come', 'form', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'voice', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'really', 'one', 'annoy', 'voice', 'character', 'put', 'pity', 'positive', 'movie', 'nd', 'half', 'movie', 'along', 'animation', 'throughout', 'strong', 'start', 'song', 'number', 'kept', 'could', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'animate', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'frozen', 'good', 'could', 'much', 'well']","[5, 12, 42, 15, 4, 7, 423, 351, 70, 4, 1215, 170, 367, 134, 33, 39, 573, 480, 79, 7, 4, 382, 101, 2090, 285, 344, 4, 652, 582, 343, 110, 791, 618, 900, 77, 199, 310, 105, 4, 233, 101, 7, 144, 71, 15, 172, 50, 244, 67, 2263, 151, 181, 332, 144, 71, 4, 135, 1934, 199, 74, 873, 40, 131, 21, 2, 1, 298, 174, 89, 2052, 5, 121, 1081, 1030, 132, 1901, 871, 96, 23, 121, 2726, 105, 889, 1, 144, 21, 315, 132, 100, 5, 901, 10, 370, 2, 3, 16, 624, 51, 184, 1405, 346, 1, 91, 64, 69, 2, 1, 51, 184, 9, 1799, 596, 152, 97, 4824, 51, 184, 9, 5, 1910, 51, 184, 179, 142, 1, 19, 31, 18, 1, 402, 8, 69, 309, 297, 94, 40, 427, 45, 183, 32, 86, 227, 17, 373, 107, 18, 332, 22, 10, 238, 86, 8, 196, 2283, 503, 1, 1897, 346, 1, 172, 21, 296, 167, 120, 11, 184, 498, 54, 403, 10, 34, 38, 1, 197, 47, 5, 17, 54, 31, 18]"

For the most part, I enjoyed the movie, however I think it does lack that extra something that made the classics of the 90's so great.The story is loosely based on Hans Christen Andersen's (forgive me if I spelled that wrong) novel ""The Snow Queen"", this movie centers around a young queen named Elsa, whose uncontrollable icy powers have covered her entire kingdom in snow. Now, her sister Anna must try to reverse the spell with the help of a mountain man named Kristoff and a snowman named Olaf. The main characters are likable for the most part, though Anna's stubbornness can get annoying from time-to-time. But Elsa is sympathetic and all around likable, and Kristoff's sarcasm is amusing, as is his goofy reindeer Sven. Of course though, the snowman Olaf steals the show. He's very quirky and hilarious. He had my whole family laughing, and we're all adults! Safe to say, because of the characters and humor alone, there's plenty to enjoy in this movie.However, there are those aforementioned elements that hinder ""Frozen"". The first of which are the songs. Now, I know a Disney film is supposed to have songs, but this one had too many, especially in the first half. Practically every time a character opened their mouth, a song came out. I think I even remember asking out loud ""am I watching a musical or an opera?"" Also, other than the ever-popular ""Let It Go"", the songs in this movie weren't really that good. I mean, I guess they were serviceable, but the lyrics really felt improvised and crammed in at times and they just didn't have that catchy spring in them that the songs in earlier Disney films did. My second problem with this film is actually more of a personal gripe, but I feel like it's worth addressing nonetheless: this film lacks a strong villain. I know this movie HAS a villain (it has two, actually), but neither really makes that big of an impact on the film or leaves a strong presence. There's not really a ""final battle"" either, one baddie just kind of fades from the movie as he becomes less important to the story while the other more primary villain basically goes down with one hit (well, really one hit and one magical ""shockwave"". Watch the movie, you'll see what I mean). I really wish they'd either left the Snow Queen (a.k.a. Elsa) as the villain or made one of the others steal her powers, because a bad guy with magical powers just works for Disney films: they provide great action scenes and guarantee a breathtaking climax. As is, when compared to the likes of Jafar, Maleficent, or some of Disney's other rogue's gallery, ""Frozen""'s bad guys are pretty limp. Still, despite some of its shortcomings, I did enjoy ""Frozen"". It had charm, it had humor, the characters were likable, and while I thought it could have been better, I did enjoy the story. So if you're a Disney fan like me, or you're just looking for something to cheer you up, watch ""Frozen"". It may not be perfect, but taken for what it is, this is still a great movie worth recommending!","['fan', 'disney', 'movie', 'life', 'admittedly', 'eager', 'see', 'frozen', 'disney', 'roll', 'lately', 'animate', 'movie', 'produce', 'new', 'hit', 'like', 'princess', 'frog', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'sadly', 'miss', 'frozen', 'theater', 'able', 'watch', 'dvd', 'part', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'however', 'think', 'lack', 'extra', 'something', 'make', 'classic', 'great', 'story', 'loosely', 'base', 'han', 'christen', 'andersen', 'forgive', 'spell', 'wrong', 'novel', 'snow', 'queen', 'movie', 'center', 'around', 'young', 'queen', 'name', 'elsa', 'whose', 'uncontrollable', 'icy', 'power', 'cover', 'entire', 'kingdom', 'snow', 'sister', 'anna', 'must', 'try', 'reverse', 'spell', 'help', 'mountain', 'man', 'name', 'kristoff', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'main', 'character', 'likable', 'part', 'though', 'anna', 'stubbornness', 'get', 'annoy', 'time', 'time', 'elsa', 'sympathetic', 'around', 'likable', 'kristoff', 'sarcasm', 'amuse', 'goofy', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'course', 'though', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'steal', 'show', 'quirky', 'hilarious', 'whole', 'family', 'laugh', 'adult', 'safe', 'say', 'character', 'humor', 'alone', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'however', 'aforementioned', 'element', 'hinder', 'frozen', 'first', 'song', 'know', 'disney', 'film', 'suppose', 'song', 'one', 'many', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'practically', 'every', 'time', 'character', 'open', 'mouth', 'song', 'come', 'think', 'even', 'remember', 'ask', 'loud', 'watch', 'musical', 'opera', 'also', 'ever', 'popular', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'mean', 'guess', 'serviceable', 'lyric', 'really', 'felt', 'improvised', 'crammed', 'time', 'catchy', 'spring', 'song', 'earlier', 'disney', 'film', 'second', 'problem', 'film', 'actually', 'personal', 'gripe', 'feel', 'like', 'worth', 'address', 'nonetheless', 'film', 'lack', 'strong', 'villain', 'know', 'movie', 'villain', 'two', 'actually', 'neither', 'really', 'make', 'big', 'impact', 'film', 'leaf', 'strong', 'presence', 'really', 'final', 'battle', 'either', 'one', 'baddie', 'kind', 'fade', 'movie', 'becomes', 'less', 'important', 'story', 'primary', 'villain', 'basically', 'go', 'one', 'hit', 'well', 'really', 'one', 'hit', 'one', 'magical', 'shockwave', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'mean', 'really', 'wish', 'either', 'left', 'snow', 'queen', 'k', 'elsa', 'villain', 'make', 'one', 'others', 'steal', 'power', 'bad', 'guy', 'magical', 'power', 'work', 'disney', 'film', 'provide', 'great', 'action', 'scene', 'guarantee', 'breathtaking', 'climax', 'compare', 'like', 'jafar', 'maleficent', 'disney', 'rogue', 'gallery', 'frozen', 'bad', 'guy', 'pretty', 'limp', 'still', 'despite', 'shortcoming', 'enjoy', 'frozen', 'charm', 'humor', 'character', 'likable', 'thought', 'could', 'well', 'enjoy', 'story', 'disney', 'fan', 'like', 'look', 'something', 'cheer', 'watch', 'frozen', 'may', 'perfect', 'take', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'worth', 'recommend']","[176, 2, 1, 79, 1987, 3320, 16, 5, 2, 985, 2067, 38, 1, 587, 108, 234, 9, 29, 659, 83, 352, 379, 1670, 271, 5, 312, 294, 23, 540, 94, 91, 1, 110, 37, 273, 1237, 89, 14, 69, 25, 12, 696, 256, 44, 3204, 339, 1584, 858, 280, 2637, 39, 49, 1, 649, 200, 73, 49, 183, 4, 620, 1853, 453, 24, 712, 264, 77, 39, 15, 7, 236, 87, 1700, 858, 135, 214, 145, 183, 67, 45, 183, 32, 119, 8, 402, 94, 100, 7, 3950, 19, 238, 20, 20, 4, 1616, 200, 402, 67, 3539, 828, 961, 151, 181, 228, 100, 45, 32, 906, 78, 908, 364, 127, 72, 190, 147, 1174, 35, 8, 222, 344, 727, 91, 1, 110, 3563, 401, 2483, 5, 36, 11, 56, 2, 3, 473, 11, 10, 61, 121, 36, 346, 1349, 115, 20, 8, 318, 1632, 11, 40, 37, 28, 391, 581, 798, 23, 51, 1473, 27, 81, 559, 30, 13, 11, 1, 22, 17, 218, 388, 5083, 475, 22, 155, 3619, 5084, 20, 266, 3082, 11, 846, 2, 3, 319, 198, 3, 103, 537, 2866, 53, 9, 254, 1595, 1792, 3, 273, 167, 104, 56, 1, 104, 42, 103, 1197, 22, 14, 106, 1153, 3, 586, 167, 2882, 22, 817, 1435, 353, 10, 2533, 193, 3536, 1, 380, 321, 289, 12, 1757, 104, 570, 13, 10, 234, 18, 22, 10, 234, 10, 170, 23, 1, 16, 218, 22, 417, 353, 330, 39, 49, 2068, 4, 104, 14, 10, 247, 906, 24, 65, 148, 170, 24, 107, 2, 3, 458, 25, 345, 90, 3255, 905, 792, 350, 9, 3951, 1902, 2, 2653, 3277, 5, 65, 148, 136, 68, 313, 3184, 91, 5, 235, 222, 8, 402, 92, 54, 18, 91, 12, 2, 176, 9, 66, 89, 1724, 23, 5, 171, 175, 55, 68, 25, 1, 254, 262]"

863,10,"I have to admit I almost feel a little embarrassed giving FROZEN my highest rating. However, in spite of my reservations about this retelling -- er, Disneyfication -- of Hans Christian Andersen's SNOW QUEEN -- being a CG film and not a traditional one (the latter format could have been used just as effectively for a film like this) -- FROZEN is surprisingly really good. Which is not something I was expecting to say given how disappointed I was with TANGLED. However, FROZEN earns my highest rating for the following reasons.While this is a ""Disneyfied"" SNOW QUEEN, it's not done in the manner one would normally expect. This is arguably a darker, edgier re-imagining; the title queen in this story is Elsa, one of two sisters whose primary motivation for causing eternal winter is not out of outright evil, but for more complex issues. The whole conflict starts off because of an accident that traumatized her and her sister, Anna, in childhood, leading the girl to become emotionally distant. This lends a surprisingly more ""adult"" angle to the story.But the best part about FROZEN is how Disney turns two of its tried and true clichés completely on its heels. There IS a handsome prince, yes, and he does romance Anna, but not for the reasons one would expect. Furthermore, the climactic ""act of true love"" needed to break Elsa's spell isn't romantic, but sister related. It's because of this that FROZEN emerges as one of Disney's best fairy tales in a long time.The chemistry between the principal characters is also very well done, especially the sister dynamic between the more aloof, distant Elsa and the outgoing, socially awkward (but sweet- natured) Anna. Prince Hans, as mentioned, isn't the picture perfect figure you'd expect. If anything, the most interesting character has to be Kristoff, a somewhat grumpy ice hauler who grudgingly agrees to help Anna find her, but naturally he turns out to be a real soft- hearted gentleman. Naturally, this DOES give this film a ""love triangle"" angle, but to reveal how it is resolved would be the equivalent of giving spoilers.The music is also great, especially Elsa's charged ballad ""Let it Go."" (The only exception is a gospel-flavored song involving trolls, which isn't BAD by any means, it just struck me as out of place with the tone of the story.) Even the occasional comic relief (from a snowman and a mute elk) doesn't overpower the dramatic depth of the story. There ARE a few places where I think Disney could have toned down the laughs, though, but it's nowhere nearly as grating as in TANGLED.I'm not quite sure where FROZEN ranks in terms of Disney's all-time greatest films, but I WAS pleasantly charmed by it and it exceeded my expectations.","['admit', 'almost', 'feel', 'little', 'embarrass', 'give', 'frozen', 'high', 'rating', 'however', 'spite', 'reservation', 'retell', 'er', 'disneyfication', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'cg', 'film', 'traditional', 'one', 'latter', 'format', 'could', 'use', 'effectively', 'film', 'like', 'frozen', 'surprisingly', 'really', 'good', 'something', 'expect', 'say', 'give', 'disappointed', 'tangle', 'however', 'frozen', 'earns', 'high', 'rating', 'follow', 'reason', 'disneyfied', 'snow', 'queen', 'manner', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'arguably', 'darker', 'edgier', 'imagine', 'title', 'queen', 'story', 'elsa', 'one', 'two', 'sister', 'whose', 'primary', 'motivation', 'cause', 'eternal', 'winter', 'outright', 'evil', 'complex', 'issue', 'whole', 'conflict', 'start', 'accident', 'traumatize', 'sister', 'anna', 'childhood', 'lead', 'girl', 'become', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'lends', 'surprisingly', 'adult', 'angle', 'story', 'best', 'part', 'frozen', 'disney', 'turn', 'two', 'try', 'true', 'clich', 'completely', 'heel', 'handsome', 'prince', 'yes', 'romance', 'anna', 'reason', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'furthermore', 'climactic', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'need', 'break', 'elsa', 'spell', 'romantic', 'sister', 'related', 'frozen', 'emerges', 'one', 'disney', 'best', 'fairy', 'tale', 'long', 'time', 'chemistry', 'principal', 'character', 'also', 'well', 'especially', 'sister', 'dynamic', 'aloof', 'distant', 'elsa', 'outgo', 'socially', 'awkward', 'sweet', 'natured', 'anna', 'prince', 'han', 'mention', 'picture', 'perfect', 'figure', 'expect', 'anything', 'interest', 'character', 'kristoff', 'somewhat', 'grumpy', 'ice', 'hauler', 'grudgingly', 'agrees', 'help', 'anna', 'find', 'naturally', 'turn', 'real', 'soft', 'hearted', 'gentleman', 'naturally', 'give', 'film', 'love', 'triangle', 'angle', 'reveal', 'resolve', 'would', 'equivalent', 'give', 'spoiler', 'music', 'also', 'great', 'especially', 'elsa', 'charge', 'ballad', 'let', 'go', 'exception', 'gospel', 'flavor', 'song', 'involve', 'troll', 'bad', 'mean', 'struck', 'place', 'tone', 'story', 'even', 'occasional', 'comic', 'relief', 'snowman', 'mute', 'elk', 'overpower', 'dramatic', 'depth', 'story', 'place', 'think', 'disney', 'could', 'tone', 'laugh', 'though', 'nowhere', 'nearly', 'grate', 'tangle', 'quite', 'sure', 'frozen', 'rank', 'term', 'disney', 'time', 'great', 'film', 'pleasantly', 'charm', 'exceed', 'expectation']","[637, 173, 53, 48, 1989, 57, 5, 206, 437, 110, 1956, 2250, 3291, 44, 245, 339, 39, 49, 1303, 3, 462, 10, 955, 1778, 54, 158, 1996, 3, 9, 5, 1179, 22, 17, 89, 131, 35, 57, 476, 83, 110, 5, 2911, 206, 437, 378, 180, 39, 49, 1377, 10, 26, 1297, 131, 1390, 1240, 1137, 590, 49, 12, 4, 10, 42, 15, 620, 1757, 2035, 328, 310, 105, 3002, 277, 771, 519, 127, 552, 120, 480, 15, 7, 466, 248, 76, 179, 910, 2076, 4620, 1179, 147, 2065, 12, 34, 94, 5, 2, 113, 42, 87, 62, 274, 291, 2796, 739, 82, 325, 363, 7, 180, 10, 26, 131, 2137, 3235, 112, 62, 6, 99, 340, 4, 858, 393, 15, 1312, 5, 3559, 10, 2, 34, 219, 114, 169, 20, 1005, 3681, 8, 27, 18, 121, 15, 988, 2076, 4, 2353, 2528, 810, 457, 3952, 7, 82, 44, 348, 438, 175, 630, 131, 212, 122, 8, 67, 572, 5085, 33, 2157, 135, 7, 71, 1102, 113, 195, 1680, 1329, 3442, 1102, 57, 3, 6, 2532, 2065, 528, 1298, 26, 2325, 57, 419, 58, 27, 25, 121, 4, 807, 1265, 30, 13, 645, 3930, 11, 584, 123, 65, 218, 1367, 188, 627, 12, 28, 1422, 309, 297, 45, 3239, 4101, 2890, 1213, 609, 12, 188, 37, 2, 54, 627, 190, 100, 801, 501, 2153, 83, 124, 207, 5, 1468, 657, 2, 20, 25, 3, 1633, 235, 1669, 452]"

It really deserved to get the best animation prize.What I love of this animation film is that they could do it in details. Most of the animators always do in common. I mean if the characters are speaking, they just draw their mouths are moving to look like they are speaking. No one could do it in details. But in this animation, they did it in details. Even how the mouth moves when they speak the words that end with ""f"" sound, they actually did exactly the same of how we speak those words that end with ""f"" sound in the real world. This is why I love this film very much.One more thing I love is the songs. Those two songs are so good. They are very popular. And a lot of people are loving them. That's why they do it in many languages. Different languages and except for English and Chinese, I don't understand the rest, they seem to be great.Although Frozen is such a great film, there's one big flaw. As some people pointed out, if Elsa could control her powers by wearing gloves, then why would she need to hide in the room for many years?

Elsa hits anna with ice magic, which she has for some reason. elsa has powers, that she could control until some dumb troll told her that fear would consume her, ironically making fear consume her. she is locked in a castle in a single room, no one allowed to see her, how she got food is beyond me. so when she is 18, she needs to become queen. Anna meets some guy named hans, he falls in water, and WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING smiles admiringly at her. not an evil smile, just a real smile. alone. no one looking. he is the villain btw. so elsa gets mad and freezes a pond, and everyone is scared of her sorcery, so she runs away. Anna goes to find her, and we meet another ""character"" Cristoph and his reindeer Sphin (dont care how its spelled.) she buys him some carrots and a rope, and he agrees to take her up a large mountain with magic. They go up there, and elsa shoots her sister with a fatal blow. she goes and sees the dumb trolls from the beginning, which say she needs a kiss. She goes to hans and ask for a kiss, but hes evil. he locks her in the room (which locks from the outside cuz why not. it had a sofa and everything, seemed like a normally comfortable room in a castle) and she is about to die. olafe (an unimportant comic- relief character) uses his nose (a carrot) to unlock the door (which locks from the outside) and gets here out. hans confronts elsa, but takes so long to finish her that dying anna blocks the hit. she is lucky frozen at that EXACT time, which breaks the metal sword, and KO's hans for no reason, and elsa hugs her, and shes unfrozen (so getting the kiss before death didn't matter), and anna punches hans. people see this moment, without seeing the rest, but cheer anyway. story over. Very flawed i know. so why does it have a 7.5 rating? well it has a few good songs (let it go) which isn't enough for a good movie. if food fight had a few good original songs in it, it wouldn't raise its score. its the fact that disneyy formulates these movies, and makes a few clever songs for each. its also the fact that 2013 sucked for animation, and this was i guess OK. i give this a 4/10. nothing great, not that exciting, and a few good scenes aren't enough to melt my frozen heart","['movie', 'everyone', 'make', 'average', 'formula', 'first', 'let', 'introduce', 'plot', 'elsa', 'hit', 'anna', 'ice', 'magic', 'reason', 'elsa', 'power', 'could', 'control', 'dumb', 'troll', 'told', 'fear', 'would', 'consume', 'ironically', 'make', 'fear', 'consume', 'lock', 'castle', 'single', 'room', 'one', 'allow', 'see', 'get', 'food', 'beyond', 'need', 'become', 'queen', 'anna', 'meet', 'guy', 'name', 'han', 'fall', 'water', 'one', 'look', 'smile', 'admiringly', 'evil', 'smile', 'real', 'smile', 'alone', 'one', 'look', 'villain', 'btw', 'elsa', 'get', 'mad', 'freeze', 'pond', 'everyone', 'scar', 'sorcery', 'run', 'away', 'anna', 'go', 'find', 'meet', 'another', 'character', 'cristoph', 'reindeer', 'sphin', 'dont', 'care', 'spell', 'buy', 'carrot', 'rope', 'agrees', 'take', 'large', 'mountain', 'magic', 'go', 'elsa', 'shoot', 'sister', 'fatal', 'blow', 'go', 'see', 'dumb', 'troll', 'begin', 'say', 'need', 'kiss', 'go', 'han', 'ask', 'kiss', 'evil', 'lock', 'room', 'lock', 'outside', 'cuz', 'sofa', 'everything', 'seem', 'like', 'normally', 'comfortable', 'room', 'castle', 'die', 'olafe', 'unimportant', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'us', 'nose', 'carrot', 'unlock', 'door', 'lock', 'outside', 'get', 'han', 'confronts', 'elsa', 'take', 'long', 'finish', 'die', 'anna', 'block', 'hit', 'lucky', 'frozen', 'exact', 'time', 'break', 'metal', 'sword', 'ko', 'han', 'reason', 'elsa', 'hug', 'shes', 'unfrozen', 'get', 'kiss', 'death', 'matter', 'anna', 'punch', 'han', 'people', 'see', 'moment', 'without', 'see', 'rest', 'cheer', 'anyway', 'story', 'flaw', 'know', 'rating', 'well', 'good', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'enough', 'good', 'movie', 'food', 'fight', 'good', 'original', 'song', 'raise', 'score', 'fact', 'disneyy', 'formulates', 'movie', 'make', 'clever', 'song', 'also', 'fact', 'suck', 'animation', 'guess', 'ok', 'give', 'nothing', 'great', 'excite', 'good', 'scene', 'enough', 'melt', 'frozen', 'heart']","[1, 109, 14, 921, 534, 36, 30, 736, 52, 4, 234, 7, 33, 150, 180, 4, 24, 54, 128, 1157, 123, 511, 187, 26, 3172, 2268, 14, 187, 3172, 382, 168, 741, 506, 10, 833, 16, 19, 2098, 614, 99, 179, 49, 7, 244, 148, 183, 44, 186, 1013, 10, 66, 914, 277, 914, 195, 914, 344, 10, 66, 104, 3604, 4, 19, 1314, 282, 3955, 109, 878, 2536, 233, 101, 7, 13, 71, 244, 102, 8, 151, 293, 858, 948, 1146, 2157, 55, 977, 214, 150, 13, 4, 1656, 15, 2163, 1255, 13, 16, 1157, 123, 160, 35, 99, 372, 13, 44, 581, 372, 277, 382, 506, 382, 769, 3924, 132, 75, 9, 1297, 3581, 506, 168, 368, 4683, 309, 297, 8, 919, 971, 1146, 5054, 478, 382, 769, 19, 44, 2867, 4, 55, 169, 855, 368, 7, 2258, 234, 1598, 5, 1392, 20, 340, 4809, 1277, 44, 180, 4, 1236, 3116, 19, 372, 517, 375, 7, 1359, 44, 46, 16, 133, 137, 16, 303, 1724, 497, 12, 386, 56, 437, 18, 17, 11, 30, 13, 164, 17, 1, 2098, 816, 17, 230, 11, 760, 223, 201, 1, 14, 691, 11, 27, 201, 1202, 21, 388, 477, 57, 156, 25, 447, 17, 90, 164, 359, 5, 80]"

Look at Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Mulan (which I also watched today), and others like Aladdin and Tangled. These are classics. Disney is known for this, it's their trademark and I am so happy that they brought it back. Now, back to the movie. This was different then any other Disney princess movie because 1. the girls were already princess/queen, 2. they were sisters, and 3. (SPOILER ALERT) the prince was an asshole. I loved the bond between Anna and Elsa and how you - or at least I - was fooled that the only way to cure Anna's frozen heart was true love's kiss. When that was revealed, naturally I thought, great here we go. The prince is her true love and blah blah blah. But no, the prince was the secret villain and not even the kind man who helped Anna trek through the snow to her sister cured her. It was her sacrifice to save her grieving sister.

870,9,"After Disney had their successful early 90's run with The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and the Lion King, things really dropped off for them. For me, the only great movies the company made from 1995-2010 were Mulan and Lilo and Stitch. They still had a decent amount that I still liked, but you could tell they were off their game a bit. I mentioned 2010 because then they got their groove back and, in my opinion, never got out of it. Tangled was great, I didn't think much of Winnie the Pooh, but it's alright, Wreck-It Ralph is now one of my all time favorite movies, and now we have Frozen. This movie continues the great trend Disney has right now. In fact, I think this renaissance is actually stronger than the previous one. Aladdin is my favorite Disney film, and Beauty and the Beast ranks third, but, to me, Mermaid was just decent, and Lion King, while still pretty good, I feel is kinda overrated. I actually like Tangled, WIR, and Frozen more than either of those two.Okay, enough with Disney history, let's talk about this movie. I feel the movie didn't really get off to a strong start, while it wasn't bad or anything, but things got really interesting after Aunna met Hans. They immediately fell in love and were going to wed. I'll talk about the rest of the story in just a moment though, the twist they do with this is VERY clever. During the movie, she meets a guy named Christoff, and he tells her ""You don't just meet a guy and marry him immediately."" I really laughed at that since this company made some films where the male and females immediately fall in love. I really like how they're poking fun at that. I did not see that coming at all. Speaking of Hans, he turns out to actually try marrying her just to be a king, and he also mentions the fact that people don't just fall in love like that. Again, didn't see that coming.I also like how Elsa didn't turn out to be a villain or anything. She doesn't want to hurt anyone, and that's why she didn't talk to Aunna much growing up. She left the kingdom because she accidentally let out her powers and they accuse her of sorcery. Her emotions put the kingdom in eternal winter, not her intentionally. She also doesn't know how to change it or anything. She finds that out later in the film though.It was also a lot funnier than I thought it would be. To add to that, I felt Olaf would be just a typical Disney sidekick who might be kinda annoying. I was wrong. Olaf is hilarious. Almost every scene he has makes me laugh. This song wasn't built up too well, but he actually has a song about how summer would be to him. That's right, a snowman dreams of summer and heat. That idea was just too funny. And it's not just him obviously. Like Wreck-It Ralph, this movie is all around funny, not just one guy has funny moments, like in some other Disney films.I felt the songs could've been stronger though, and some of them aren't built up well. To me, they're kinda rushed. I do like the song Elsa sings after she goes to be alone though. That was great. The other ones aren't bad, but they're no Circle of Life or anything. Although they do have quite a few smaller singing scenes. What I mean is that they would sing for like a minute or so and stop. I also would've liked Hans to be defeated in a better way. He had such a great plot and suspense, and yet all that happens is that his sword breaks as he tries to kill Elsa, then when summer returns, Anna punches him into the water, then he goes to jail. Is that it? He was such a great villain! That's like if Gaston at the end of Beauty and the Beast decided ""You know what, Belle's crazy. I'll just leave her alone."" This film almost got a 10/10 from me, but it's few issues prevent that. However, I think everything else is fantastic and very well done. This is easily one of the best films of the year, and I will recommend it.","['disney', 'successful', 'early', 'run', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'aladdin', 'lion', 'king', 'thing', 'really', 'drop', 'great', 'movie', 'company', 'make', 'mulan', 'lilo', 'stitch', 'still', 'decent', 'amount', 'still', 'like', 'could', 'tell', 'game', 'bit', 'mention', 'get', 'groove', 'back', 'opinion', 'never', 'get', 'tangle', 'great', 'think', 'much', 'winnie', 'pooh', 'alright', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movie', 'frozen', 'movie', 'continue', 'great', 'trend', 'disney', 'right', 'fact', 'think', 'renaissance', 'actually', 'strong', 'previous', 'one', 'aladdin', 'favorite', 'disney', 'film', 'beauty', 'beast', 'rank', 'third', 'mermaid', 'decent', 'lion', 'king', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'feel', 'kinda', 'overrate', 'actually', 'like', 'tangle', 'wir', 'frozen', 'either', 'two', 'okay', 'enough', 'disney', 'history', 'let', 'talk', 'movie', 'feel', 'movie', 'really', 'get', 'strong', 'start', 'bad', 'anything', 'thing', 'get', 'really', 'interest', 'aunna', 'met', 'han', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'go', 'wed', 'talk', 'rest', 'story', 'moment', 'though', 'twist', 'clever', 'movie', 'meet', 'guy', 'name', 'christoff', 'tell', 'meet', 'guy', 'marry', 'immediately', 'really', 'laugh', 'since', 'company', 'make', 'film', 'male', 'female', 'immediately', 'fall', 'love', 'really', 'like', 'poke', 'fun', 'see', 'come', 'speak', 'han', 'turn', 'actually', 'try', 'marry', 'king', 'also', 'mention', 'fact', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'like', 'see', 'come', 'also', 'like', 'elsa', 'turn', 'villain', 'anything', 'want', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'talk', 'aunna', 'much', 'grow', 'left', 'kingdom', 'accidentally', 'let', 'power', 'accuse', 'sorcery', 'emotion', 'put', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'intentionally', 'also', 'know', 'change', 'anything', 'find', 'later', 'film', 'though', 'also', 'lot', 'funnier', 'thought', 'would', 'add', 'felt', 'olaf', 'would', 'typical', 'disney', 'sidekick', 'might', 'kinda', 'annoy', 'wrong', 'olaf', 'hilarious', 'almost', 'every', 'scene', 'make', 'laugh', 'song', 'built', 'well', 'actually', 'song', 'summer', 'would', 'right', 'snowman', 'dream', 'summer', 'heat', 'idea', 'funny', 'obviously', 'like', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'movie', 'around', 'funny', 'one', 'guy', 'funny', 'moment', 'like', 'disney', 'film', 'felt', 'song', 'could', 'strong', 'though', 'built', 'well', 'kinda', 'rush', 'like', 'song', 'elsa', 'sings', 'go', 'alone', 'though', 'great', 'one', 'bad', 'circle', 'life', 'anything', 'although', 'quite', 'small', 'sing', 'scene', 'mean', 'would', 'sing', 'like', 'minute', 'stop', 'also', 'would', 'like', 'han', 'defeat', 'well', 'way', 'great', 'plot', 'suspense', 'yet', 'happens', 'sword', 'break', 'try', 'kill', 'elsa', 'summer', 'return', 'anna', 'punch', 'water', 'go', 'jail', 'great', 'villain', 'like', 'gaston', 'end', 'beauty', 'beast', 'decide', 'know', 'belle', 'crazy', 'leave', 'alone', 'film', 'almost', 'get', 'issue', 'prevent', 'however', 'think', 'everything', 'else', 'fantastic', 'well', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'recommend']","[2, 814, 594, 233, 48, 422, 149, 203, 485, 152, 97, 43, 22, 1207, 25, 1, 789, 14, 931, 3315, 2274, 68, 546, 624, 68, 9, 54, 143, 925, 95, 348, 19, 2346, 74, 258, 88, 19, 83, 25, 37, 31, 4957, 3167, 2216, 352, 379, 10, 20, 189, 1, 5, 1, 647, 25, 1678, 2, 130, 201, 37, 465, 103, 167, 763, 10, 485, 189, 2, 3, 149, 203, 1468, 715, 422, 546, 152, 97, 68, 136, 17, 53, 629, 426, 103, 9, 83, 5, 353, 42, 420, 164, 2, 636, 30, 178, 1, 53, 1, 22, 19, 167, 120, 65, 212, 43, 19, 22, 122, 5088, 392, 44, 597, 843, 6, 13, 2822, 178, 303, 12, 133, 100, 129, 691, 1, 244, 148, 183, 3958, 143, 244, 148, 390, 597, 22, 190, 98, 789, 14, 3, 431, 237, 597, 186, 6, 22, 9, 1794, 125, 16, 40, 641, 44, 113, 103, 87, 390, 97, 27, 348, 201, 46, 186, 6, 9, 16, 40, 27, 9, 4, 113, 104, 212, 59, 305, 299, 178, 5088, 31, 285, 330, 77, 300, 30, 24, 2373, 2536, 240, 196, 77, 310, 105, 2443, 27, 56, 209, 212, 71, 358, 3, 100, 27, 84, 1850, 92, 26, 269, 155, 32, 26, 376, 2, 436, 252, 629, 238, 280, 32, 364, 173, 115, 90, 14, 190, 11, 787, 18, 103, 11, 205, 26, 130, 45, 626, 205, 1601, 281, 85, 613, 9, 352, 379, 1, 200, 85, 10, 148, 85, 133, 9, 2, 3, 155, 11, 54, 167, 100, 787, 18, 629, 525, 9, 11, 4, 794, 13, 344, 100, 25, 10, 65, 2154, 79, 212, 255, 124, 601, 63, 90, 218, 26, 63, 9, 211, 284, 27, 26, 9, 44, 2294, 18, 50, 25, 52, 2093, 182, 591, 1277, 340, 87, 286, 4, 205, 385, 7, 1359, 1013, 13, 3959, 25, 104, 9, 41, 149, 203, 491, 56, 1780, 1008, 322, 344, 3, 173, 19, 519, 1264, 110, 37, 132, 270, 253, 18, 403, 10, 34, 3, 47, 262]"
871,3,"Here is another film I find it my duty to eviscerate. A lot of the hype surrounding Frozen came from convictions that it broke unprecedented ground in both Disney and mainstream entertainment. Disproving love at first sight? Theme of bonds between sisters? Anyone learned enough will tell you Jane Austen did this first. This movie is two centuries behind in terms of ""breaking ground!"" We have to use the resources available to us to know what's been done and what hasn't or we're stuck reinventing the wheel over and over. I was shocked at how much less of a character Elsa has than the fandom made (makes? I'm not sure how active the Frozen fandom is at this point) her out to have. We are barely privy to her thoughts. She only expresses embarrassment about her powers and the ubiquitous concern for Anna. Speaking of Elsa's powers, the movie doesn't give us a reason for them! Disney movies often have fantastic elements you have to just accept, which children can do, but it's much more difficult for me to suspend my disbelief. When something can work because it just can in the world you create, that's a slippery slope towards writing that has no emotional impact. Case in point: At the end, the incredibly vague POWER OF LURVE allows Elsa to control her powers. I thought she already loved Anna! I can't fathom this part because the movie wouldn't explain the logistics. And don't tell me to turn my brain off and enjoy it; Disney has put out more believable stories than this. The romance element is quite unnecessary, which I concede is progress for a film starring women. Kristoff belongs to a Type of guy I instantly recognize, but a Type I LOATHE. He and Anna share no chemistry to grab my attention; the trolls have to force it like fanfic writers. So much for the heroine's own choices! Like Elsa, Anna is not given enough psychological depth, plus she's cutesy in the worst way. Although, I don't deny there are people like that. . . Olaf might be the worst thing about the movie. Characters like him are a large reason why I'm not one of those adults who still watches Disney movies on her own time. Look, if it's not too late, don't show your daughter this, show her Sense and Sensibility, which uses a similar setup first and better.","['another', 'film', 'find', 'duty', 'eviscerate', 'lot', 'hype', 'surround', 'frozen', 'come', 'conviction', 'broke', 'unprecedented', 'ground', 'disney', 'mainstream', 'entertainment', 'disprove', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'theme', 'bond', 'sister', 'anyone', 'learn', 'enough', 'tell', 'jane', 'austen', 'first', 'movie', 'two', 'century', 'behind', 'term', 'break', 'ground', 'use', 'resource', 'available', 'u', 'know', 'stuck', 'reinvent', 'wheel', 'shock', 'much', 'less', 'character', 'elsa', 'fandom', 'make', 'make', 'sure', 'active', 'frozen', 'fandom', 'point', 'barely', 'privy', 'thought', 'express', 'embarrassment', 'power', 'ubiquitous', 'concern', 'anna', 'speak', 'elsa', 'power', 'movie', 'give', 'u', 'reason', 'disney', 'movie', 'often', 'fantastic', 'element', 'accept', 'child', 'much', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'something', 'work', 'world', 'create', 'slippery', 'slope', 'towards', 'write', 'emotional', 'impact', 'case', 'point', 'end', 'incredibly', 'vague', 'power', 'lurve', 'allows', 'elsa', 'control', 'power', 'thought', 'already', 'love', 'anna', 'fathom', 'part', 'movie', 'explain', 'logistics', 'tell', 'turn', 'brain', 'enjoy', 'disney', 'put', 'believable', 'story', 'romance', 'element', 'quite', 'unnecessary', 'concede', 'progress', 'film', 'star', 'woman', 'kristoff', 'belongs', 'type', 'guy', 'instantly', 'recognize', 'type', 'loathe', 'anna', 'share', 'chemistry', 'grab', 'attention', 'troll', 'force', 'like', 'fanfic', 'writer', 'much', 'heroine', 'choice', 'like', 'elsa', 'anna', 'give', 'enough', 'psychological', 'depth', 'plus', 'cutesy', 'bad', 'way', 'although', 'deny', 'people', 'like', 'olaf', 'might', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', 'character', 'like', 'large', 'reason', 'one', 'adult', 'still', 'watch', 'disney', 'movie', 'time', 'look', 'late', 'show', 'daughter', 'show', 'sense', 'sensibility', 'us', 'similar', 'setup', 'first', 'well']","[102, 3, 71, 2857, 84, 406, 1353, 5, 40, 1802, 2535, 1051, 2, 2633, 839, 6, 36, 675, 226, 482, 15, 299, 347, 164, 143, 3369, 3370, 36, 1, 42, 1248, 750, 657, 340, 1051, 158, 4359, 3236, 177, 56, 954, 3868, 666, 31, 321, 8, 4, 3032, 14, 14, 207, 3205, 5, 3032, 117, 944, 92, 1099, 3960, 24, 3197, 1844, 7, 641, 4, 24, 1, 57, 177, 180, 2, 1, 583, 253, 401, 869, 70, 31, 1113, 4212, 2672, 89, 107, 126, 134, 3009, 4611, 538, 165, 342, 1153, 514, 117, 41, 603, 5018, 24, 1671, 4, 128, 24, 92, 397, 6, 7, 5089, 94, 1, 400, 143, 113, 1242, 91, 2, 196, 1374, 12, 363, 401, 124, 845, 1149, 3, 249, 251, 67, 2011, 524, 148, 1498, 1428, 524, 2635, 7, 781, 1005, 1854, 541, 123, 272, 9, 605, 31, 565, 862, 9, 4, 7, 57, 164, 2376, 609, 569, 3259, 65, 50, 255, 1893, 46, 9, 32, 252, 65, 43, 1, 8, 9, 977, 180, 10, 147, 68, 23, 2, 1, 20, 66, 530, 78, 389, 78, 217, 2876, 919, 446, 3000, 36, 18]"

I particularly like this is one of the few animations created by a woman, my daughter loves the movie, and I enjoyed it too - without it being inappropriate for her age.Sure there are comical parts in what the characters say, mostly Olaf - but come on, he's a talking snowman who is silly. He was created originally when the protagonist was really young, and created for an even younger little sister. The movie is a fresh of breath air and I definitely think Disney is on the right track with this one.

875,10,"It saddens me that so many people have added negative reviews of this film based on religious and political grounds. Yes, you know who you are and it spoils this site as an independent guide to help people decide whether to watch movies based on the experiences of others. That's the rant over, and publish it or not, but to be frank, I'm surprised others have got away with ridiculous one star reviews of this film because they've been directed to do it.I own pretty much all the Disney back catalogue and this is up there with the very best. I have 4 children, two older ones brought up on Little Mermaid, then Aladdin and Lion King, and two little ones who loved Tangled, then watched backwards from there. So, I'll let my 8 year old be the judge: the best film she's ever seen, she says.Some people say the film was a missed opportunity because Elsa should be the star, or should have love interest, but I love it as it is. Maybe it's because the two sisters are so like my children, in terms of colouring, age gap, character (pulling your eyes open when it's morning!), everything, but I'm sure most Mums and Dads with daughters can see some of their own in these two. Both Elsa and Anna are great, and different, characters. The film is nicely balanced between the two, and nobody is judged as good or bad, right or wrong, except maybe Hans and that man from Weselton (or Weasel Town). And Elsa is strong enough to manage without a man anyway. To make her meet her prince would weaken the story.Let It Go is a great song, especially the film version (some said there were no stand out numbers) and at times, the score verged on operatic. Maybe some don't like that, but I love opera, so it's a plus for me.I'll stop there because I'm rambling now, but go and see it for yourself with an open mind. I would struggle to rate it against other Disney films and you don't really have to, just enjoy it for what it is.

879,8,"The film itself is good. Not a masterpiece, but neither a bad film.The positive traits of the film were the animation, the comedy, the characters and the ""Let it Go"" song. Another good thing is Hans. I already knew that he would be the villain, because I already had read about the film, but the performance made by him is too believable. When he seemed a good person, his acting was so good that it's not hard to admire such villain. The comic relief, Olaf, actually does something in the storyline, and is not a plain useless, falsely comedic and irritating character. In the negative aspects, there are some things. The pace of the film is so fast that emotional moments like the Arendelle kings' death didn't have the emotional charge it should have. There were too many songs that were completely dispensable. The storyline tended to be too convenient for the main cast. Another problem is the unneeded romance between Anna and Kristoff. That romance is forced and hyper- cliché. The fast pace surely doesn't help.Personally, the film is among my favorites, but I don't be blinded to consider it a masterpiece or introducer of new elements to Disney canon.","['film', 'good', 'masterpiece', 'neither', 'bad', 'film', 'positive', 'trait', 'film', 'animation', 'comedy', 'character', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'another', 'good', 'thing', 'han', 'already', 'knew', 'would', 'villain', 'already', 'read', 'film', 'performance', 'make', 'believable', 'seem', 'good', 'person', 'act', 'good', 'hard', 'admire', 'villain', 'comic', 'relief', 'olaf', 'actually', 'something', 'storyline', 'plain', 'useless', 'falsely', 'comedic', 'irritate', 'character', 'negative', 'aspect', 'thing', 'pace', 'film', 'fast', 'emotional', 'moment', 'like', 'arendelle', 'king', 'death', 'emotional', 'charge', 'many', 'song', 'completely', 'dispensable', 'storyline', 'tend', 'convenient', 'main', 'cast', 'another', 'problem', 'unneeded', 'romance', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'romance', 'force', 'hyper', 'clich', 'fast', 'pace', 'surely', 'help', 'personally', 'film', 'among', 'favorite', 'blind', 'consider', 'masterpiece', 'introducer', 'new', 'element', 'disney', 'canon']","[3, 17, 461, 1197, 65, 3, 503, 1133, 3, 21, 279, 8, 30, 13, 11, 102, 17, 43, 44, 397, 488, 26, 104, 397, 547, 3, 493, 14, 1374, 75, 17, 441, 112, 17, 307, 2270, 104, 309, 297, 32, 103, 89, 295, 915, 1490, 1043, 1352, 8, 761, 443, 43, 564, 3, 780, 342, 133, 9, 199, 97, 517, 342, 807, 61, 11, 291, 295, 1913, 1858, 119, 227, 102, 198, 3328, 363, 7, 67, 363, 272, 274, 780, 564, 960, 135, 520, 3, 471, 189, 3963, 421, 461, 108, 401, 2, 1541]"
880,8,"Watched this with my daughter, it was the first time I saw it and the 3rd for her. This is a story about two sisters, the older one having an unusual power that makes her able to summon winter. An accident involving her powers happens and to protect her younger sister their parents separates them. Anna's memory of ever having fun with her older sister Elsa is wiped by the help from some trolls, just to protect her. It has a different take on the villain in this movie (but usually all villains aren't thoroughly evil nowadays). Actually the villain switches.. Great animation, standard Disney-style. A lot of snow, funny characters...all in all good, but it feels a little bit like the World everything plays out in is a bit in a bubble, maybe it's just me? The Singing is all right I guess, standard in Disney movies. One character almost was re-used though, the horse from Rapunzel, which I think is slightly better.

882,7,"Frozen (2013) is by no means a train wreck, but I found the Beauty and the Beast (1991) comparisons ludicrous. The films of the early Disney Renaissanze like The Little Mermaid (1989) and BatB were films that broke the mold and revolutionized feature animation. Frozen is an entertaining film, but it does nothing new: we've seen strong female protagonists in a Disney film before, the Prince Charming/love at first sight idea has been lampooned/satirized better in other films such as Enchanted (2007), Princess and the Frog (2008), and Shrek 2 (2004), and there are Disney films with vastly superior music.The story is serviceable, but messy, a case of too many cooks in the kitchen. Interesting ideas are brought up but never developed to their full potential. The relationship between the sisters gets lost in the midst of romance and comedy. While Elsa is a magnificent character, it is unfortunate that she is not our protagonist. Instead we get Anna, who is much like a thousand other modern animated heroes and heroines: spazzy and optimistic, though her desire for love gives her some depth. Not a bad character, but I still feel like I've seen her like before. The Hans character is cool, but I wish he and his secret had been used for another film.The animation is beautiful, especially the effects animation on the snow and Elsa's ice magic. I've never been keen on the character designs, which are too doll-like for my tastes.While much praise has been heaped upon the music, I found it almost all of it forgettable. It's also much too modern sounding, which takes one out of the 19th century setting and will no doubt date the movie much the same way the operetta styled love songs in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) tether that film to the 1930s.In the end, a pretty film, but I don't think it will prove to be the enduring classic many have labelled it as.","['frozen', 'mean', 'train', 'wreck', 'found', 'beauty', 'beast', 'comparison', 'ludicrous', 'film', 'early', 'disney', 'renaissanze', 'like', 'little', 'mermaid', 'batb', 'film', 'broke', 'mold', 'revolutionize', 'feature', 'animation', 'frozen', 'entertain', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'see', 'strong', 'female', 'protagonist', 'disney', 'film', 'prince', 'charm', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'idea', 'lampoon', 'satirize', 'well', 'film', 'enchant', 'princess', 'frog', 'shrek', 'disney', 'film', 'vastly', 'superior', 'music', 'story', 'serviceable', 'messy', 'case', 'many', 'cook', 'kitchen', 'interest', 'idea', 'brought', 'never', 'developed', 'full', 'potential', 'relationship', 'sister', 'get', 'lose', 'midst', 'romance', 'comedy', 'elsa', 'magnificent', 'character', 'unfortunate', 'protagonist', 'instead', 'get', 'anna', 'much', 'like', 'thousand', 'modern', 'animate', 'hero', 'heroine', 'spazzy', 'optimistic', 'though', 'desire', 'love', 'give', 'depth', 'bad', 'character', 'still', 'feel', 'like', 'see', 'like', 'han', 'character', 'cool', 'wish', 'secret', 'use', 'another', 'film', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'effect', 'animation', 'snow', 'elsa', 'ice', 'magic', 'never', 'keen', 'character', 'design', 'doll', 'like', 'taste', 'much', 'praise', 'heaped', 'upon', 'music', 'found', 'almost', 'forgettable', 'also', 'much', 'modern', 'sound', 'take', 'one', 'th', 'century', 'set', 'doubt', 'date', 'movie', 'much', 'way', 'operetta', 'style', 'love', 'song', 'snow', 'white', 'seven', 'dwarf', 'tether', 'film', 'end', 'pretty', 'film', 'think', 'prove', 'endure', 'classic', 'many', 'label']","[5, 218, 1124, 352, 231, 149, 203, 1126, 3, 594, 2, 9, 48, 422, 3, 1802, 2308, 3861, 229, 21, 5, 243, 3, 156, 108, 16, 167, 237, 354, 2, 3, 82, 235, 6, 36, 675, 281, 18, 3, 615, 29, 659, 1208, 2, 3, 4783, 1185, 58, 12, 5083, 2400, 514, 61, 122, 281, 599, 88, 610, 246, 685, 153, 15, 19, 489, 4988, 363, 279, 4, 935, 8, 1555, 354, 208, 19, 7, 31, 9, 324, 38, 544, 565, 1268, 100, 1070, 6, 57, 609, 65, 8, 68, 53, 9, 16, 9, 44, 8, 556, 417, 508, 158, 102, 3, 21, 93, 121, 278, 21, 39, 4, 33, 150, 88, 2744, 8, 424, 1287, 9, 1120, 31, 535, 4443, 554, 58, 231, 173, 660, 27, 31, 324, 259, 55, 10, 1210, 1248, 144, 681, 927, 1, 31, 50, 355, 6, 11, 39, 365, 1721, 1573, 3, 41, 136, 3, 37, 799, 2006, 69, 61, 2233]"
883,7,"Frozen(2013) is one of those films that get's so much praise but personally I think it's just overrated. It's okay it's not great but it's not bad either. My sister loves it. I don't. It certainly had some good moments in it and it was funny in a few scenes. The animation was amazing. But the story didn't do much for me. I don't know, maybe it's because I'm a 14 year old male. This kind of thing just doesn't appeal to me. But let's look at the story anyway. Anna and Elsa are 2 little princesses. One night they're playing when Elsa accidentally hits Anna with her freeze ray abilities and knocks her unconscious. Her parents take her to some trolls who rescue Anna but tell them she can't see her sister anymore. This leads to one of the music elements. And in this musical element we learn that their parents died in a ship wreak. Yeah, I guess this was supposed to be sad but I can't sympathize with characters who had maybe 5 lines. And it doesn't really focus much on the deaths after this scene either. But anyway so coronation day comes and Anna meets a prince named Hans. I swear I will never hear that name again without first thinking about the killer from M (1931). But anyway he's a nice guy. And guess what? Anna shares maybe 7 lines with him and she knows that he's the one. Literally, they say that. But anyway Elsa accidentally reveals her powers and traps the kingdom in an eternal winter, while she runs away to the mountains where she plans too live the rest of her life in exile. Anna meanwhile goes to find her sister with the help of ice salesman Kristoff. By the way I can't think that Ice is a very big market. Along the way they're joined by our comic relief a snowman named Olaf. They try to reconcile with Elsa but to no avail. Oh and remember Hans from earlier. The film suddenly decided he's a villain now. There were never any clues to figure that out so I'm guessing that M Night Shyamalan was working on that part. And the rest of the movie is all stock. Elsa realizes her mistake. She tries to fix it. Hans get's defeated and they all live happily ever after. Until the next inevitable sequel. Overall the film wasn't awful but neither was it awesome. It was just okay. That's really the only reaction I can think of after viewing this film. But a lot of girls liked and that's easy to see because I'm not a girl. So if you are, then you'll probably like it. I do have to give it credit though because this is one of the few times in a Disney film where the queen is a good guy. When is the last time you ever saw a film where the queen was good? Other than Brave (2012)I don't recall any.

884,8,"Say what you will about conservative Disney, there is some form of modernization in progress in that studio. You might even label it a feminist wave of sorts. Frozen marks Disney's first feature length animated film (co-)directed by a woman and only the second whose screenplay was written by such a creature. Not counting Pixar, since then it would have to contend with Brave, a movie where the girl power backfired, as did the quality of the piece as a whole. And while Frozen largely stays within the trite-and-true boundaries we've come to expect from Disney's fairy tale movies, including princesses, charming princes, faraway lands, comedic (animal) sidekicks and plenty of catchy songs, enough of such regularly exploited material is directionally changed to make the film feel as fresh and cool as the imagery the title inspires. Jennifer Lee's directorial debut introduces not one, but two beautiful young princesses, Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) and her younger sister Anna (Kristen Bell), heirs to the kingdom of Arendelle. Both are kind, independent and energetic spirits, but the older girl carries a terrible secret: she's basically a mutant with the power to control ice and snow, except she doesn't control it at all, since her fear to wield it controls her instead. She has cause to be afraid of her powers, as she nearly killed Anna at play as a child. Her parents tried to keep her out of harm's way by largely keeping her confined to her chambers, much to the dismay of her sister, who had her injury and memory of the incident erased by a nice wizard troll (this is a work of fantasy, need I say more?). After the death of their parents and the coming-of-age of the elder sister, a coronation takes place where Elsa is crowned queen and where Anna – hilariously – meets her apparent groom-to-be, the latter event utterly disrupting the former as Elsa unwittingly gets pushed so far she sparks an endless winter that covers the entire kingdom in frost. Fleeing the palace to built her own on a high mountain precipice where she finally starts to accept her powers in her moments of isolation, Anna is determined to bring back her sister and get her to undo her unintentional damage to the realm, which leaves her land vulnerable to the shady ambition of certain visiting foreign dignitaries. Accompanied by a simple but reliable young backwoods man named Kristoff, his carrot obsessed reindeer Sven and a wacky living snowman named Olaf, Anna sets out on a tough voyage to reunite with her wayward sister and bring summer back to Arendelle. And, in typical Disney fashion, to discover True Love in the process. But not in the usual sense of old.Frozen proves a worthy successor to the similarly themed, equally wonderful Tangled (2010), which also re-established Disney's formidable talent to craft charming, adventurous and romantic fantasy films for all ages after over a decade of creative drought, as well as updating its female characters to the 21st century, a time in which the main focus of a woman is no longer a man to marry (but also not excluding the possibility as not to upset the traditionalists in the audience). Frozen introduces two solid female characters who care first and foremost about each other, though one of them does not allow herself to show said fact. Both women are sizzling with recognizable character flaws and strengths, familiar emotional family conflict and the talent to burst into song, so despite their ultimately antagonistic nature (though the traditional 'good versus bad' set-up is carefully avoided in their strained relationship), you root for them and their sibling affection both to survive against all odds. Simultaneously, while the stereotypical good looking prince to wed is not an image to be discarded, it develops into quite another direction than is usual, and the expected notion of cheesy True Love messages doesn't end up covering the usual sexual connection between boy and girl. The voice cast delivers impeccable acting and shares an audible chemistry, standout performances including a hilarious Scandinavian tradesman (jå!) and Olaf, the token sidekick, who is not nearly as irritating as he could have been and actually warms everybody's heart with his simple but unattainable desire. Similarly enjoyable are the clan of stone trolls, Kristoff's surrogate family, a group of Smurfesque creatures with the ability to successfully camouflage themselves as rocks, and who unfortunately don't nearly have as much screen time or background exploration as we would have liked. And if you're afraid the reindeer talks (since animals with the ability to speak are an oft dreaded Disney staple still), fear not: his master does so for him to witty, almost self-reflective results. The songs are a welcome return to tradition; though for a moment at the start of the film they seem to comprise most of the dialogue, better balance to the music is applied later on. Apart from pleasing the aural senses, Frozen offers a delightful visual feast as well with its wondrous winter landscapes and ever present snow motifs, but considering the darkness of many scenes coupled with the obligatory 3D effect, not all the imagery ends up looking as amazing as it could have been. However, many of the 3D shots in the lighter scenes hit their mark, especially those involving snow and icicles, so seeing the 2D version instead isn't wholly recommended either.In a time where Pixar is increasingly going down the drain creatively because of its lack of inspiration and its current focus on prequels and sequels, a thoroughly wonderful and ideologically original pure Disney film like Frozen is a welcome sight. Even the coolest minds and the coldest hearts will find it hard not to melt due to this film's built-in warmth, and with the dominant motif of snow and ice, Frozen proves to be a perfect Holiday movie for old and young alike.","['say', 'conservative', 'disney', 'form', 'modernization', 'progress', 'studio', 'might', 'even', 'label', 'feminist', 'wave', 'sort', 'frozen', 'mark', 'disney', 'first',

885,4,"Maybe because the critics were desperate for a Christmas time blockbuster that wasn't an action film (like Thor, The Hunger Games, or The Hobbit), that's why this average Disney animated musical, ended up receiving a multitude of accolades. In my view, however, it was overrated; not at all because of the music and special effects, which were quite good, but rather for the weak narrative.'Frozen' is very loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale, 'The Snow Queen' but bears little resemblance to the original classic tale. In the original, the two children were male and female; here there are two sisters of royal stock: eight year old Elsa who is afflicted with magical powers and her perky younger sister, five year old Anna, who live in the kingdom of Annendale (which in part bears a resemblance to a 19th century Norwegian fishing village). When Elsa can't control her powers (which involve turning everything into ice when she points her fingers), she accidentally injures her sister while they are playing. The result is the very awkward scenario of having Elsa locked up in her room until she's crowned queen as a teenager, following the demise of her parents, who are lost at sea during a storm.The demise of the parents is handled quite nicely before we arrive at the big coronation scene but children may find it disturbing that the film's scenarists opt to dispose of the parental figures and leave the two young girls as orphans. There is some stupendous 3D animation throughout the film, especially the interior shots of the palace (dig the Bruegel-like paintings on the wall, for example).The best part of 'Frozen' involves Anna's infatuation with the duplicitous Prince Hans. The whirlwind courtship between the inexperienced Anna and Hans, is undoubtedly meant as a cautionary tale for young women who are too easily taken in by good looks and facile words fashioned to manipulate, as opposed to proposals infused with sincerity. Elsa, on the other hand, sees through her sister's inexperience and refuses to give her blessing (as well as permission) for Anna to wed Hans, after a few hours of superficial courtship. Unfortunately, the rest of 'Frozen' is downhill. Anna strikes out on her own to try and find her sister the Queen, who's fled because again she is unable to control her own magical powers. Anna is aided by good guy 'Kristoff' the ice dealer and his trusty reindeer, Sven, and wouldn't you know it, Anna falls in love with him (after of course Prince Hans outs himself by revealing that his true intentions was to marry Anna and take over the Arrendale throne). That reversal is a nice twist but Hans is a minor villain in the pantheon of 'Frozen' antagonists, which all can be described as 'minor'.The problem with 'Frozen' is that it basically lacks an antagonist. Instead, the scenarists rely on Elsa's INTERNAL CONFUSION to move the story along. There is no evil 'Snow Queen' for the audience to root against. Instead, we merely are dragged along until Elsa inevitably gets herself together. But one wonders why she can't get herself together sooner. Instead of fighting an external villain, Elsa becomes an unlikeable loser who ends up creating a monstrous snowman, that almost hurls sister Anna and her soon-to-be boyfriend, off a cliff (also please include dopey Olaf, Anna's childhood snowman, who gets taken apart and put together again, ad infinitum).The all-powerful Elsa, is then somehow subdued by a few martinets and imprisoned in a jail cell with iron mitts. If she's such a powerful 'sorcerer', why does it take so long before she's able to 'freeze dry' the mitts and escape the jail cell? That's actually a minor contrivance compared to the climax when Elsa 'realizes' that Anna has sacrificed herself to save her. When Anna thaws out of her frozen state, that's when (duh!) Elsa realizes that only true love can set her own self free and also save the kingdom from eternal winter. Again, why does it take so long for (clueless) Elsa to realize the power of love? It's only hinted at (in the first few minutes of the film) but some kind of malevolent force has played with her self-esteem. But since that 'force' never manifests itself as a tangible entity, Elsa is reduced to being an ineffectual neurotic (hardly much of a crafty villain or heroine, we can root for!). As noted above, 'Frozen' has some great animation and the songs are bouncy and tuneful. Idina Menzel, of 'Wicked' fame, belts out the Elsa numbers and does quite well, especially the most catchy number, 'Let It Go'. Demi Lovato reprises 'Let It Go' on the end credits, but doesn't have as warm a voice as Menzel (and arrangement #2 doesn't help either). For years Disney attempted to adapt Han Christian Anderson's 'Snow Queen' as an animated feature without success. The difficulty in adapting such a sophisticated story is apparent in the current failure entitled 'Frozen'. Should a sequel be in the works, it would be best to create an actual Snow Queen antagonist, which could then propel this new adaptation, in a more efficacious direction.","['maybe', 'critic',

886,8,"Disney's Frozen is a lush movie with beautiful animation and spirit. While watching the breathtaking blue ice and snow form dazzling spirals and the characters expose their souls to each other, as the audience you cannot help but feel touched inside. This ""Disney Princess Tale"" is not about finding your true love, but about a more immediate love that you are born with, and that's the love you have for your siblings; for your family. Yes, you get a slight romance between some characters but it isn't the focal point of the story, so if that is what you expected you will be surprised.Elsa shuts out her sister Anna and Anna doesn't know why. But it isn't out of malice or jealousy or superiority. Elsa loves her sister and because she is scared of harming her she keeps her distance. The journey that ensues teaches Anna what love is and Elsa her core. There are some twists in this tale that will shock you and awe you. The story gives the allusion that it will be one way and it shifts into something else. It's a good time trying to keep up with the events that almost haphazardly take place in this coming of age story. This movie is powerful in such a new way for Disney that one viewing will never be enough.The songs are cute, not really the best that Disney has peddled but they tell the story and help you to experience the emotions that you were meant to while viewing it. (My personal favorite is the opening song ""Do you want to build a Snowman?"" which shows the isolation and love that these sisters go through and almost lose.) I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who loves a musical, and family tale, a Disney movie or just a really touching film. 9.8/10","['disney', 'frozen', 'lush', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'spirit', 'watch', 'breathtaking', 'blue', 'ice', 'snow', 'form', 'dazzle', 'spiral', 'character', 'expose', 'soul', 'audience', 'help', 'feel', 'touch', 'inside', 'disney', 'princess', 'tale', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'immediate', 'love', 'born', 'love', 'sibling', 'family', 'yes', 'get', 'slight', 'romance', 'character', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'expect', 'surprised', 'elsa', 'shuts', 'sister', 'anna', 'anna', 'know', 'malice', 'jealousy', 'superiority', 'elsa', 'love', 'sister', 'scar', 'harm', 'keep', 'distance', 'journey', 'ensues', 'teach', 'anna', 'love', 'elsa', 'core', 'twist', 'tale', 'shock', 'awe', 'story', 'give', 'allusion', 'one', 'way', 'shift', 'something', 'else', 'good', 'time', 'try', 'keep', 'event', 'almost', 'haphazardly', 'take', 'place', 'come', 'age', 'story', 'movie', 'powerful', 'new', 'way', 'disney', 'one', 'view', 'never', 'enough', 'song', 'cute', 'really', 'best', 'disney', 'peddle', 'tell', 'story', 'help', 'experience', 'emotion', 'meant', 'view', 'personal', 'favorite', 'opening', 'song', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'show', 'isolation', 'love', 'sister', 'go', 'almost', 'lose', 'love', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'love', 'musical', 'family', 'tale', 'disney', 'movie', 'really', 'touch', 'film']","[2, 5, 1834, 1, 93, 21, 767, 23, 905, 991, 33, 39, 427, 1786, 2435, 8, 1318, 1074, 159, 135, 53, 260, 882, 2, 29, 114, 71, 62, 6, 2178, 6, 589, 6, 409, 72, 325, 19, 2117, 363, 8, 3244, 117, 12, 131, 703, 4, 2878, 15, 7, 7, 56, 4, 6, 15, 878, 709, 154, 1486, 337, 4966, 621, 7, 6, 4, 1399, 129, 114, 666, 2059, 12, 57, 4979, 10, 50, 1967, 89, 270, 17, 20, 87, 154, 618, 173, 55, 188, 40, 139, 12, 1, 439, 108, 50, 2, 10, 413, 88, 164, 11, 265, 22, 34, 2, 143, 12, 135, 334, 240, 868, 413, 537, 189, 631, 11, 59, 202, 45, 78, 600, 6, 15, 13, 173, 489, 6, 1, 26, 262, 299, 6, 51, 72, 114, 2, 1, 22, 260, 3]"

However, this movie was really, really great. It had such a captivating story that made viewers want to watch all of it. I kept wondering what would happen next which is something I rarely think when watching a children's movie. First, it is such an appealing movie to watch. The characters are so cute and the land they live in looks so pretty. Disney did very well with the animation. My favorite character was the snowman, Olaf. They did such a good job making Olaf cute and funny. My favorite part was that it was emotional and that it told a powerful story. It was good to see a movie that encompassed a young woman fighting for her relationship with her sister. The dynamic between the two sisters was also interesting and I found to be something that can actually occur in real-life just in different terms. The movie had such a great moral of the story type ending. It proved that it is necessary to put family first before anything else and to always be there for each other which I believe kids need to hear more of.","['husband', 'watch', 'movie', 'niece', 'opening', 'night', 'huge', 'disney', 'fan', 'often', 'care', 'child', 'movie', 'however', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'great', 'captivate', 'story', 'make', 'viewer', 'want', 'watch', 'kept', 'wonder', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'something', 'rarely', 'think', 'watch', 'child', 'movie', 'first', 'appeal', 'movie', 'watch', 'character', 'cute', 'land', 'live', 'look', 'pretty', 'disney', 'well', 'animation', 'favorite', 'character', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'good', 'job', 'make', 'olaf', 'cute', 'funny', 'favorite', 'part', 'emotional', 'told', 'powerful', 'story', 'good', 'see', 'movie', 'encompass', 'young', 'woman', 'fight', 'relationship', 'sister', 'dynamic', 'two', 'sister', 'also', 'interest', 'found', 'something', 'actually', 'occur', 'real', 'life', 'different', 'term', 'movie', 'great', 'moral', 'story', 'type', 'end', 'prove', 'necessary', 'put', 'family', 'first', 'anything', 'else', 'always', 'believe', 'kid', 'need', 'hear']","[1749, 23, 1, 1340, 631, 773, 360, 2, 176, 583, 293, 70, 1, 110, 1, 22, 22, 25, 1024, 12, 14, 479, 59, 23, 498, 532, 26, 290, 418, 89, 1691, 37, 23, 70, 1, 36, 484, 1, 23, 8, 265, 757, 224, 66, 136, 2, 18, 21, 189, 8, 45, 32, 17, 373, 14, 32, 265, 85, 189, 94, 342, 511, 439, 12, 17, 16, 1, 73, 251, 816, 153, 15, 988, 42, 15, 27, 122, 231, 89, 103, 1932, 195, 79, 140, 657, 1, 25, 551, 12, 524, 41, 799, 1496, 196, 72, 36, 212, 270, 163, 220, 60, 99, 568]"
888,10,"OK, I'll be honest, I really hated the movie right after I finished watching it. After thinking about it, though, I found a lot of things I liked about Frozen, and now it's one of my favorite Disney films.To start off, it really does sound like a musical, and I think Frozen would be hard to understand, let alone like, if you don't think about it in terms of a musical. The voices of Bell and Menzel are outstanding and comparable to the singing found on Broadway musicals. The structure of the songs is also to be lauded as well, especially the parts where Anna and Elsa have singing roles together (it has that conversational feel found in many musicals like Les Miseables that is unfortunately lacking in many older Disney films). The movie is revolutionary because not only does it feature two heroes (or rather heroines), but also introduced one of the few anti-heroines in the history of film. Anna is a true heroine in the sense that she's got to save the kingdom from an eternal winter and win over her sister. Elsa, on the other hand, thrives as the anti-heroine in the story. OK, so she freezes the kingdom and seems a little cold (no pun intended), but we can forgive her for that (after all, she's been locked up for God knows how long). There are many things to like about her, such as her desire to protect Anna. And, in the end, it is Elsa that saves the kingdom from the eternal winter through learning how to truly love again from Anna.Another revolutionary factor of the movie is women power. OK, this topic has been highly debated, but overall I think the evidence really leans towards the positive:1. Elsa is the queen (not princess), and she acts solo. Have you ever seen a queen that ended up single in a Disney movie before? 2. Anna forgoes Kristoff to save her sister Elsa instead from a sly Hans. She's a pretty independent thinker throughout the film. Remind me who made Hans come along with her to find Elsa... 3. The movie isn't about finding true love, it's about rekindling the bonds of brother/sisterhood. Truly unique for Disney.Call me out, but I claim that no other Disney film has ever given women so much power. Oh yeah, and what's up with the ""slutty dress"" argument?Speaking about controversy, Frozen seemed to attract the most of any Disney movie. Homosexuality, feminism (or not feminism), racism, etc. Ironically, that's good, not bad. When a movie stirs people to address their own personal beliefs, I think that's good for a society. The worst movies are the ones that don't inspire you to do anything. Mormons, feminists and anti-feminists, and Samis may not concur with me, but I don't care. The controversy surrounding Frozen also makes it revolutionary, and in a good way.From the reviews I have read, you either love Frozen or you hate it. I encourage those of you who hate it, try to think about the movie a little differently than you have been for previous Disney movies. Try not to view the movie from your own biased perspective (which was what caused me to hate the movie at the outset), and I think at least you'll respect it a little more.","['ok', 'honest', 'really', 'hat', 'movie', 'right', 'finish', 'watch', 'think', 'though', 'found', 'lot', 'thing', 'like', 'frozen', 'one', 'favorite', 'disney', 'film', 'start', 'really', 'sound', 'like', 'musical', 'think', 'frozen', 'would', 'hard', 'understand', 'let', 'alone', 'like', 'think', 'term', 'musical', 'voice', 'bell', 'menzel', 'outstanding', 'comparable', 'sing', 'found', 'broadway', 'musical', 'structure', 'song', 'also', 'laud', 'well', 'especially', 'part', 'anna', 'elsa', 'sing', 'role', 'together', 'conversational', 'feel', 'found', 'many', 'musical', 'like', 'le', 'miseables', 'unfortunately', 'lack', 'many', 'old', 'disney', 'film', 'movie', 'revolutionary', 'feature', 'two', 'hero', 'rather', 'heroine', 'also', 'introduce', 'one', 'anti', 'heroine', 'history', 'film', 'anna', 'true', 'heroine', 'sense', 'get', 'save', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'win', 'sister', 'elsa', 'hand', 'thrives', 'anti', 'heroine', 'story', 'ok', 'freeze', 'kingdom', 'seem', 'little', 'cold', 'pun', 'intend', 'forgive', 'lock', 'god', 'know', 'long', 'many', 'thing', 'like', 'desire', 'protect', 'anna', 'end', 'elsa', 'save', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'learn', 'truly', 'love', 'anna', 'another', 'revolutionary', 'factor', 'movie', 'woman', 'power', 'ok', 'topic', 'highly', 'debate', 'overall', 'think', 'evidence', 'really', 'lean', 'towards', 'positive', 'elsa', 'queen', 'princess', 'act', 'solo', 'ever', 'see', 'queen', 'end', 'single', 'disney', 'movie', 'anna', 'forgoes', 'kristoff', 'save', 'sister', 'elsa', 'instead', 'sly', 'han', 'pretty', 'independent', 'thinker', 'throughout', 'film', 'remind', 'make', 'han', 'come', 'along', 'find', 'elsa', 'movie', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'rekindle', 'bond', 'brother', 'sisterhood', 'truly', 'unique', 'disney', 'call', 'claim', 'disney', 'film', 'ever', 'give', 'woman', 'much', 'power', 'oh', 'yeah', 'slutty', 'dress', 'argument', 'speak', 'controversy', 'frozen', 'seem', 'attract', 'disney', 'movie', 'homosexuality', 'feminism', 'feminism', 'racism', 'etc', 'ironically', 'good', 'bad', 'movie', 'stir', 'people', 'address', 'personal', 'belief', 'think', 'good', 'society', 'bad', 'movie', 'one', 'inspire', 'anything', 'mormon', 'feminist', 'anti', 'feminist', 'sami', 'may', 'concur', 'care', 'controversy', 'surround', 'frozen', 'also', 'make', 'revolutionary', 'good', 'way', 'review', 'read', 'either', 'love', 'frozen', 'hate', 'encourage', 'hate', 'try', 'think', 'movie', 'little', 'differently', 'previous', 'disney', 'movie', 'try', 'view', 'movie', 'bias', 'perspective', 'cause', 'hate', 'movie', 'outset', 'think', 'least', 'respect', 'little']","[477, 742, 22, 606, 1, 130, 855, 23, 37, 100, 231, 84, 43, 9, 5, 10, 189, 2, 3, 120, 22, 259, 9, 51, 37, 5, 26, 307, 216, 30, 344, 9, 37, 657, 51, 86, 146, 116, 764, 3534, 63, 231, 411, 51, 1795, 11, 27, 3461, 18, 121, 94, 7, 4, 63, 371, 332, 53, 231, 61, 51, 9, 2066, 573, 273, 61, 64, 2, 3, 1, 2494, 229, 42, 544, 191, 565, 27, 736, 10, 1273, 565, 636, 3, 7, 62, 565, 217, 19, 111, 77, 310, 105, 374, 15, 4, 323, 1273, 565, 12, 477, 282, 77, 75, 48, 366, 1396, 913, 1584, 382, 1006, 56, 169, 61, 43, 9, 1070, 513, 7, 41, 4, 111, 77, 310, 105, 347, 329, 6, 7, 102, 2494, 945, 1, 251, 24, 477, 1639, 472, 2764, 166, 37, 3418, 22, 2739, 538, 503, 4, 49, 29, 112, 1618, 81, 16, 49, 41, 741, 2, 1, 7, 67, 111, 15, 4, 208, 4501, 44, 136, 1058, 296, 3, 1047, 14, 44, 40, 172, 71, 4, 1, 71, 62, 6, 3364, 482, 865, 861, 329, 414, 2, 308, 1042, 2, 3, 81, 57, 251, 31, 24, 425, 830, 907, 1375, 641, 5110, 5, 75, 2808, 2, 1, 2349, 1979, 1979, 430, 2268, 17, 65, 1, 2288, 46, 1595, 537, 1796, 37, 17, 943, 65, 1, 10, 500, 212, 1636, 720, 1273, 720, 5036, 171, 293, 5110, 1353, 5, 27, 14, 2494, 17, 50, 161, 547, 353, 6, 5, 333, 1657, 333, 87, 37, 1, 48, 2155, 763, 2, 1, 87, 413, 1, 1715, 1141, 328, 333, 1, 3771, 37, 250, 1311, 48]"

By far the best animated feature of 2013, its preview hardly did FROZEN justice (focussing as it did on a trio of comic relief characters, including the enchanting snowman Olaf, who provided my summary quotation). Most of the songs here are Princess Classics, and though the African Choir-style opening and closing piece or the jazzy mid-movie duet may be a bit jarring in contrast, nothing can detract very much from the stunning visuals of FROZEN. With famed Scandanavian story teller Hans Christian Andersen (""The Snow Queen"") providing source material, the plot is gripping enough and the villain emerges so late that even adults should be entranced.

891,-,"""Any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke. She will need her sisterhood."" - Gloria Steinem An animated feature by Walt Disney Studios, ""Frozen"" stars Idina Menzel as Elsa, a young queen who hides the fact that she possesses cryokinetic powers. Ashamed of who she is, and filled with self-loathing, Elsa spends her life in isolation. Worried about Elsa is Princess Anna (Kristen Bell), Elsa's younger sister.""Frozen's"" second act finds Elsa's secret being revealed to the citizens of her kingdom. With her secret out, Elsa promptly embraces who she is, the once timid girl becoming a sexy and assertive spokesperson for raging cryo-femininity. Owning her identity, and singing ""Let it Go"" with lungs like trumpets, Elsa begins to strut her stuff like a MTV diva. You go girl!Disney typically offers a rather puritanical, sexist and classist take on romance. In ""Frozen"", however, these conventions are toyed with and then rejected. We the audience are manipulated into expecting a conventional prince-saves-damsel-in-distress climax, only to get something a bit different. In the end, it is the ""true love"" which exists between sisters, women and girls that rescues our cast from loneliness and doom. The film doesn't reject men, or heteronomative love, but presents sororal love on equal or greater terms. Like most recent Walt Disney Features, ""Frozen"" thinks children are stupid. The film is aggressively manic, believes its audience has short attention spans, holds no shot for longer than a few moments, and lacks even an once of thematic, visual or emotional subtlety. ""Frozen's"" camera moves fast, characters are incessantly yapping and patience is presented as the ultimate vice. Graceless, frenetic and reluctant to let any scene breathe, the film doesn't so much talk down to kids, as treat them as easily distracted morons. Why, Disney? Why fill a film with gorgeous spaces, places and compositions, only to hack at each with an editor's knife?Disney has made a number of quasi-feminist works (""Brave"" and ""Mulan"" in particular). ""Frozen"" itself works as a broad allegory for the acceptance of everything from homosexuality to femininity to personal idiosyncrasies. These admirable traits, however, are increasingly diluted by Elsa's behaviour. In the world of ""Frozen"", ""being true to yourself"" and ""unleashing your personality"" ultimately means becoming a skinny white chick who lives in a castle and dances like a fashion model/pop-star. The film doesn't usher the isolated, alienated and insecure out of their shells, it tells them to step out only if they look like Taylor Swift. Elsewhere ""Frozen"" continues Disney's creepy infatuation with dead parents, feudalism, divine rights, absolute rule and monarchy. Hayao Miyazaki animated ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" in 1984. Despite a talented, brave and at times insecure girl at its centre, the film didn't feel any need to get on a soap-box or self-reflexively flash its ""feminist"" credentials. Simply interested in good characters, Miyazaki treats the ""tenets"" of feminism as being implicitly understood. Virtually all of Miyazaki's subsequent films, and those produced by his animation studio (""Only Yesterday"", ""From Up on Poppy Hill"", ""The Secret World of Arrietty""), feature similar portrayals of girls or women. Disney, in contrast, cannot help but turn each of its modern female characters into a blatant mission statement. Disney's modern women/girls aren't characters so much as they are a neurotic mega-corporation's attempts at penance. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen, the film was written and co-directed by Jennifer Lee. 7.9/10 – Better recent animated films: Chomet's ""The Illusionist"", Hosoda's ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", ""Summer Wars"", ""Only Yesterday"", ""The Secret World of Arrietty"", Oshii's ""The Sky Crawlers"", ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" and Yeon Sang-ho's ""The King of Pigs"".

892,9,"The classic Disney animated films – the really classic ones, like the films made when Walt Disney was still alive – all possessed an uncanny ability to capture childhood emotions that were easily shared by adults and children alike.Frozen is one of the few recent films to capture that classic Disney spirit. Very, very loosely adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, it's the story of the Nordic kingdom of Arendelle and the two orphaned sisters, Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell), charged with running it. The spunky heroine and lonely castle hearken back to recent hit Tangled; the sisterly conflict feels like The Little Mermaid; the knowing fairy tales riffs are pure Enchanted. This is rigorous Disney hit-making at its finest, but with enough charm to get away with it. From the loneliness of children, and the fright and anticipation it breeds, to the fear of not being able to control your own fears and emotions, Frozen packs a lot of emotional resonance into its story. Even before Elsa's powers of shooting ice and snow from her fingertips run rampant, Elsa and Anna's parents perish in a single shot of a howling storm at sea. The death of the king and queen means Elsa must take over, but the stress of her coronation (and Anna's dumb-cluck decision to get engaged to a hunky prince she just met) makes her lose control. Elsa storms up into the mountains, leaving ice castles and blizzards in her wake and belting the power ballad ""Let It Go."" Anna's heroic journey is, refreshingly, not about a boy or even about herself: she travels into the mountains to convince Elsa to return, and teams up with rugged ice salesman Kristof to get there. Kristof and Anna are going to fall for each other eventually, of course, and she'll ditch that princely fiancé Hans, but the focus remains firmly on Anna and Elsa, as the screenplay repeatedly subverts fairy tale tropes to make them about sisterly, not romantic, love. Is it perfect? No. The villain(s) feel shoe-horned into the story, and weren't necessary to tell the story. Had the story been about the two sisters, and their emotional journey, this could've been up there as one of the best animated films of all time, along with Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. But as is, it still is a wonderful story to watch with the whole family. Frozen is a fairly old-fashioned movie, even with a couple of the welcome twists it adds to the usual true-love- will-save-you storyline.","['classic', 'disney', 'animate', 'film', 'really', 'classic', 'one', 'like', 'film', 'make', 'walt', 'disney', 'still', 'alive', 'possess', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'capture', 'childhood', 'emotion', 'easily', 'share', 'adult', 'child', 'alike', 'frozen', 'one', 'recent', 'film', 'capture', 'classic', 'disney', 'spirit', 'loosely', 'adapt', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'story', 'nordic', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'two', 'orphan', 'sister', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'charge', 'run', 'spunky', 'heroine', 'lonely', 'castle', 'hearken', 'back', 'recent', 'hit', 'tangle', 'sisterly', 'conflict', 'feel', 'like', 'little', 'mermaid', 'know', 'fairy', 'tale', 'riff', 'pure', 'enchant', 'rigorous', 'disney', 'hit', 'make', 'fine', 'enough', 'charm', 'get', 'away', 'loneliness', 'child', 'fright', 'anticipation', 'breed', 'fear', 'able', 'control', 'fear', 'emotion', 'frozen', 'pack', 'lot', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'story', 'even', 'elsa', 'power', 'shoot', 'ice', 'snow', 'fingertip', 'run', 'rampant', 'elsa', 'anna', 'parent', 'perish', 'single', 'shot', 'howl', 'storm', 'sea', 'death', 'king', 'queen', 'mean', 'elsa', 'must', 'take', 'stress', 'coronation', 'anna', 'dumb', 'cluck', 'decision', 'get', 'engage', 'hunky', 'prince', 'met', 'make', 'lose', 'control', 'elsa', 'storm', 'mountain', 'leave', 'ice', 'castle', 'blizzard', 'wake', 'belting', 'power', 'ballad', 'let', 'go', 'anna', 'heroic', 'journey', 'refreshingly', 'boy', 'even', 'travel', 'mountain', 'convince', 'elsa', 'return', 'team', 'rugged', 'ice', 'salesman', 'kristof', 'get', 'kristof', 'anna', 'go', 'fall', 'eventually', 'course', 'ditch', 'princely', 'fianc', 'han', 'focus', 'remains', 'firmly', 'anna', 'elsa', 'screenplay', 'repeatedly', 'subverts', 'fairy', 'tale', 'trope', 'make', 'sisterly', 'romantic', 'love', 'perfect', 'villain', 'feel', 'shoe', 'horn', 'story', 'necessary', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'emotional', 'journey', 'could', 'one', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'time', 'along', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'still', 'wonderful', 'story', 'watch', 'whole', 'family', 'frozen', 'fairly', 'old', 'fashion', 'movie', 'even', 'couple', 'welcome', 'twist', 'add', 'usual', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'storyline']","[69, 2, 38, 3, 22, 69, 10, 9, 3, 14, 410, 2, 68, 1301, 2219, 3093, 367, 611, 466, 240, 403, 781, 147, 70, 725, 5, 10, 399, 3, 611, 69, 2, 767, 696, 912, 44, 245, 339, 219, 114, 12, 1692, 77, 199, 42, 2291, 15, 4, 141, 116, 7, 162, 146, 807, 233, 1909, 565, 930, 168, 4958, 74, 399, 234, 83, 711, 552, 53, 9, 48, 422, 56, 219, 114, 3591, 724, 615, 2, 234, 14, 470, 164, 235, 19, 101, 1505, 70, 5121, 3888, 187, 294, 128, 187, 240, 5, 2161, 84, 342, 4566, 12, 28, 4, 24, 1656, 33, 39, 3577, 233, 4, 7, 118, 3105, 741, 1103, 3829, 713, 1002, 517, 97, 49, 218, 4, 236, 55, 2312, 343, 7, 1157, 758, 19, 619, 3147, 82, 392, 14, 489, 128, 4, 713, 214, 322, 33, 168, 1508, 1238, 1949, 24, 1265, 30, 13, 7, 2812, 337, 3084, 408, 28, 1766, 214, 1444, 4, 385, 486, 1371, 33, 1443, 1230, 19, 1230, 7, 13, 186, 652, 228, 5122, 4725, 1331, 44, 261, 1550, 3178, 7, 4, 1027, 2872, 219, 114, 1032, 14, 711, 393, 6, 175, 104, 53, 4676, 3860, 12, 1496, 143, 12, 12, 42, 15, 342, 337, 54, 10, 34, 38, 3, 20, 172, 149, 203, 152, 97, 68, 215, 12, 23, 127, 72, 5, 890, 64, 974, 1, 28, 398, 1108, 129, 269, 562, 62, 6, 111, 295]"

894,3,"Frozen has been called ""the best animated film ever"" by countless people. Akira, Felidae and Watership Down were undoubtedly better if you want a real story. Frozen was a typical Disney movie, the animation style no different from Toy Story or Monster's Inc. The plot is the typical princess story; a girl has a curse put on her and her sister (both are princesses), falls in love. She finds true love in the end. Aww, how sweet (sarcastic). The only difference of this film is that they really shove all that young girl self-esteem garbage in there. And the soundtrack is the worst I've heard in years, the lyrics are just weird and stupid and the singing isn't that good. It is a kid's movie, so for that it deserves a 3/10, but adults love it more than kids do, and I'll never understand why. It's in my opinion the worst movie to come out since the Hunger Games.

895,4,"I loved the teaser trailer for Frozen, where Olaf the snowman and Sven the reindeer compete for the snowman's lost carrot nose. That trailer, which was barely a minute long, was both beautiful and hilarious, and the two characters bounced off each other very well. Which is why the end result of the film Frozen is so baffling, and its Guinness Book of Records worthy level of overratedness is such a slap in my face.Frozen is pretty, I'll give it that. The winter landscapes and the character designs - apart from the wolves - is top-notch. The plot is a whole different story. The story isn't just bad - with characters exhibiting no common sense or the story reaching any sort of conclusion that's logical within its universe - it's downright offensive at parts. The trolls attempting to force Anna to marry Kristoff? Anna and Elsa's parents scared by the troll to keep Elsa's powers locked up, instead of teaching her to harness them? The idea that ""love"" is the solution to Elsa's accidental winter curse? Just vile.Anna is hardly even a character; she is airheaded and lacks any sense of reason, to the point that it becomes downright uncomfortable to watch her scenes. The director stated that Anna and Elsa would have goals beyond Cinderella's. Um, wasn't Cinderella's goal to be free of her abusive relatives? Anna, on the other hand, is only interested in finding a man, yet finds the time somewhere in there to be worried about Elsa too. The whole song ""Love is an Open Door"" is almost parody-like in its awfulness (a couple two rows down from me in the movie theatre exchanged glances at its conclusion and muttered ""What the f***?""). Don't even get me started on the wolf attack scene, as if those poor animals don't have it hard enough already.Which brings us back to Olaf and Sven, shining like beacons through it all. The two are fantastic characters – funny, charming and lovable – who deserved to be in a much better story than this. Like, say, one starring them. Like in the teaser trailer. Apparently the story went through development hell and they had no idea what to do with it, and it certainly feels like it when watching Frozen. The songs aren't even great, and they're way too showing-off and sing-songy instead of rising from the story (""Let it Go"" made me especially feel like this).I cannot even fathom how people can praise Frozen as the best Disney film in 20 years, when it's far more mediocre than Tangled, Wreck-It-Ralph and The Princess and the Frog, all of which are well-realized and magical movies with both beauty and heart. Frozen, on the other hand, feels cold, almost parody-like in its one-dimensionality. Don't believe the hype, what you have here is only an average movie.","['love', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'frozen', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'sven', 'reindeer', 'compete', 'snowman', 'lose', 'carrot', 'nose', 'trailer', 'barely', 'minute', 'long', 'beautiful', 'hilarious', 'two', 'character', 'bounce', 'well', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'frozen', 'baffling', 'guinness', 'book', 'record', 'worthy', 'level', 'overratedness', 'slap', 'face', 'frozen', 'pretty', 'give', 'winter', 'landscape', 'character', 'design', 'apart', 'wolf', 'top', 'notch', 'plot', 'whole', 'different', 'story', 'story', 'bad', 'character', 'exhibit', 'common', 'sense', 'story', 'reach', 'sort', 'conclusion', 'logical', 'within', 'universe', 'downright', 'offensive', 'part', 'troll', 'attempt', 'force', 'anna', 'marry', 'kristoff', 'anna', 'elsa', 'parent', 'scar', 'troll', 'keep', 'elsa', 'power', 'lock', 'instead', 'teach', 'harness', 'idea', 'love', 'solution', 'elsa', 'accidental', 'winter', 'curse', 'vile', 'anna', 'hardly', 'even', 'character', 'airheaded', 'lack', 'sense', 'reason', 'point', 'becomes', 'downright', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'scene', 'director', 'state', 'anna', 'elsa', 'would', 'goal', 'beyond', 'cinderella', 'um', 'cinderella', 'goal', 'free', 'abusive', 'relative', 'anna', 'hand', 'interested', 'find', 'man', 'yet', 'find', 'time', 'somewhere', 'worried', 'elsa', 'whole', 'song', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'almost', 'parody', 'like', 'awfulness', 'couple', 'two', 'row', 'movie', 'theatre', 'exchange', 'glance', 'conclusion', 'mutter', 'f', 'even', 'get', 'start', 'wolf', 'attack', 'scene', 'poor', 'animal', 'hard', 'enough', 'already', 'brings', 'u', 'back', 'olaf', 'sven', 'shin', 'like', 'beacon', 'two', 'fantastic', 'character', 'funny', 'charm', 'lovable', 'deserve', 'much', 'well', 'story', 'like', 'say', 'one', 'star', 'like', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'apparently', 'story', 'go', 'development', 'hell', 'idea', 'certainly', 'feel', 'like', 'watch', 'frozen', 'song', 'even', 'great', 'way', 'show', 'sing', 'songy', 'instead', 'rise', 'story', 'let', 'go', 'make', 'especially', 'feel', 'like', 'even', 'fathom', 'people', 'praise', 'frozen', 'best', 'disney', 'film', 'year', 'far', 'mediocre', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'princess', 'frog', 'well', 'realize', 'magical', 'movie', 'beauty', 'heart', 'frozen', 'hand', 'feel', 'cold', 'almost', 'parody', 'like', 'one', 'dimensionality', 'believe', 'hype', 'average', 'movie']","[6, 1773, 394, 5, 32, 45, 181, 151, 2738, 45, 489, 1146, 971, 394, 944, 211, 169, 93, 364, 42, 8, 1969, 18, 41, 648, 3, 5, 2619, 596, 1593, 790, 440, 2384, 381, 5, 136, 57, 105, 889, 8, 424, 512, 2002, 239, 1129, 52, 127, 140, 12, 12, 65, 8, 2604, 999, 217, 12, 1046, 539, 734, 2624, 654, 2474, 1830, 94, 123, 448, 272, 7, 390, 67, 7, 4, 118, 878, 123, 154, 4, 24, 382, 208, 621, 3308, 281, 6, 2450, 4, 2826, 105, 405, 5123, 7, 976, 28, 8, 273, 217, 180, 117, 380, 1830, 3073, 23, 90, 770, 881, 7, 4, 26, 2525, 614, 854, 2941, 854, 2525, 593, 3970, 3215, 7, 323, 946, 71, 145, 182, 71, 20, 1867, 1800, 4, 127, 11, 6, 318, 478, 173, 2096, 9, 398, 42, 1, 1275, 2461, 3115, 734, 1272, 28, 19, 120, 2002, 1931, 90, 973, 876, 307, 164, 397, 509, 177, 74, 32, 181, 2034, 9, 42, 253, 8, 85, 235, 726, 483, 31, 18, 12, 9, 35, 10, 249, 9, 1773, 394, 755, 12, 13, 356, 778, 281, 442, 53, 9, 23, 5, 11, 28, 25, 50, 78, 63, 4848, 208, 880, 12, 30, 13, 14, 121, 53, 9, 28, 5089, 46, 535, 5, 34, 2, 3, 47, 142, 752, 83, 352, 379, 29, 659, 18, 428, 170, 1, 149, 80, 5, 323, 53, 366, 173, 2096, 9, 10, 220, 406, 921, 1]"
896,2,"(There's also a spoiler of Snow White in my review!) I do not understand what the movie is about; I had watched it twice but cannot find a story. All I see is a princess has special powers that can seem a threat to others, so she runs away; she finds a place she likes, stays there for a while, then goes back home. Where is the story; what made her want to go back if she left because of the fear others had of her powers; did her powers go away? I am majoring in English and have a minor in Creative Writing; I am a story writer myself. An important thing in a story is plot. What is the plot in Frozen? As I said before, princess runs away then runs back home. There is too much music in the movie and not enough story. When comparing it to other Disney movies, it is good in the idea of music, but there also has to be an equal amount of story. For example, Snow White: Snow White appears cleaning and sings a song, the mirror tells the queen that Snow White is the fairest of them all, so the queen sends the huntsman to kill Snow White; he lets her go and she runs, she passes out... There is plenty of story before the next song. This is what Frozen lacks. Frozen is nothing but music.","['also', 'spoiler', 'snow', 'white', 'review', 'understand', 'movie', 'watch', 'twice', 'find', 'story', 'see', 'princess', 'special', 'power', 'seem', 'threat', 'others', 'run', 'away', 'find', 'place', 'like', 'stay', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'story', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'left', 'fear', 'others', 'power', 'power', 'go', 'away', 'major', 'english', 'minor', 'creative', 'write', 'story', 'writer', 'important', 'thing', 'story', 'plot', 'plot', 'frozen', 'say', 'princess', 'run', 'away', 'run', 'back', 'home', 'much', 'music', 'movie', 'enough', 'story', 'compare', 'disney', 'movie', 'good', 'idea', 'music', 'also', 'equal', 'amount', 'story', 'example', 'snow', 'white', 'snow', 'white', 'appear', 'cleaning', 'sings', 'song', 'mirror', 'tell', 'queen', 'snow', 'white', 'fairest', 'queen', 'sends', 'huntsman', 'kill', 'snow', 'white', 'let', 'go', 'run', 'pass', 'plenty', 'story', 'next', 'song', 'frozen', 'lack', 'frozen', 'nothing', 'music']","[27, 419, 39, 365, 161, 216, 1, 23, 1227, 71, 12, 16, 29, 316, 24, 75, 2180, 247, 233, 101, 71, 188, 9, 510, 13, 74, 533, 12, 14, 59, 13, 74, 330, 187, 247, 24, 24, 13, 101, 823, 2246, 670, 1014, 165, 12, 605, 289, 43, 12, 52, 52, 5, 35, 29, 233, 101, 233, 74, 533, 31, 58, 1, 164, 12, 350, 2, 1, 17, 281, 58, 27, 1718, 624, 12, 396, 39, 365, 39, 365, 582, 794, 11, 1944, 143, 49, 39, 365, 49, 2086, 286, 39, 365, 30, 13, 233, 1122, 727, 12, 418, 11, 5, 273, 5, 156, 58]"
897,4,"Until Zootopia had finally come into the picture, everyone questionably not only went head over heels for this film, but would not get over it after TWO whole years. At the beginning of 2015, it felt as though the the film had just come out, even though it was released 2 years prior to that, because it was still fresh in everyone's minds due to all of the ridiculous praising on the internet. The first time that I watched it, I actually didn't hate it. My favorite character was Kristof personally, for he seemed like a genuine and sweet dude. Olaf was alright, however after a while his presence was starting to get really annoying due to his ignorance and stupidity. Everyone else in the movie seemed to lack common sense. Ana is whiny and spoiled (even for princess standards) and is oblivious towards everything. I get her vulnerability due to, I guess, basically being alone for all these years, but come on, wanting to marry a guy you've just met? Yes, it's clearly pointing the obvious fact that something is fishy with this Hans guy suddenly showing up in her life, singing about finishing each other's sandwiches, and proposing to her. A prince, who is desperate to marry into the throne, psh..no way. Then once she finds out that Hans is actually evil, she then suddenly realizes that, ""Oh wow, I guess Kristof loves me lol duh"" after having a chat with a stupid snowman standing next to a fire. Because in Disney movies, if a guy is trying to keep you from getting killed, you must have some sort of romantic connection with him, and it obviously means that it's because he thinks that you're cute. She's got a nice singing voice though, so thanks Kristen Bell. Elsa is even worse. Elsa's musical number sucks, she treats her sister like crap instead of conversing with her and explaining her issues so that at least Ana could understand (yes the took Ana's memory of Elsa's powers away, for some stupid reason, I don't think that was any bit necessary for that to happen in order for her to unfreeze her head or whatever. Even if it did make sense at that time, when Ana had finally found out about her powers, she didn't suddenly disappear or anything stupid like that, meaning that Elsa and her idiotic parents could've told her what was going on with her sister a long time ago. But whatever. And then the worst part, the end, when she finally discovers how to control her powers, ""Love. Haha the answer is love"" LOVE GUYS. Because love conquers all guys!

899,7,"When this movie came out in 2013 it reminded me in a way of Star Wars back in 1977 because no one expected Star Wars to become the pop culture icon like it did and the same can be said for Frozen. The movie is very enjoyable. It is loosely based on the Hans Christian Anderson story The Snow Queen. It centers around two girls Elsa and her sister Anna. Elsa was born with the power to create ice and snow and because of this the girls get to play and create snowmen but during one recent romp Anna is injured by Elsa's power. Their Parents decide that Elsa's powers must be made a secret and kept under control. A few years later and its Elsa's Coronation but she gets into an argument with Anna when she asks Elsa for her blessing to marry a Prince she just met on the same day. Elsa loses control and her powers are exposed to everybody, As a result the entire Kingdom is engulfed in Winter. Elsa runs away to the mountains and Anna with help from an iceman named Kristoff and his pet deer Sven go after her to bring her back so she can use her powers to break the winter spell and bring summer back. The voice acting is first rate with Kristen Bell as Anna and the amazing singer Idina Menzel as Elsa. What sets Frozen apart from other Disney movies is its soundtrack which features the Academy award wining song ""Let it Go"" by Idina Menzel. (The film would go on to win the Academy award for best animated movie) another thing that's unique is the focus of the relationship between the two sisters witch is original in a Disney film. One character that's a scene stealer is Olaf the snowman who was created by Elsa as a little girl but comes to life to help Anna find her sister (He likes warm hugs). All in all Frozen is good movie that's not to dark or sad and can be enjoyed by the whole family.","['movie', 'come', 'remind', 'way', 'star', 'war', 'back', 'one', 'expect', 'star', 'war', 'become', 'pop', 'culture', 'icon', 'like', 'say', 'frozen', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'loosely', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'story', 'snow', 'queen', 'center', 'around', 'two', 'girl', 'elsa', 'sister', 'anna', 'elsa', 'born', 'power', 'create', 'ice', 'snow', 'girl', 'get', 'play', 'create', 'snowman', 'one', 'recent', 'romp', 'anna', 'injured', 'elsa', 'power', 'parent', 'decide', 'elsa', 'power', 'must', 'make', 'secret', 'kept', 'control', 'year', 'later', 'elsa', 'coronation', 'get', 'argument', 'anna', 'asks', 'elsa', 'blessing', 'marry', 'prince', 'met', 'day', 'elsa', 'loses', 'control', 'power', 'expose', 'everybody', 'result', 'entire', 'kingdom', 'engulfed', 'winter', 'elsa', 'run', 'away', 'mountain', 'anna', 'help', 'iceman', 'name', 'kristoff', 'pet', 'deer', 'sven', 'go', 'bring', 'back', 'use', 'power', 'break', 'winter', 'spell', 'bring', 'summer', 'back', 'voice', 'act', 'first', 'rate', 'kristen', 'bell', 'anna', 'amaze', 'singer', 'idina', 'menzel', 'elsa', 'set', 'frozen', 'apart', 'disney', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'feature', 'academy', 'award', 'win', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'idina', 'menzel', 'film', 'would', 'go', 'win', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'animate', 'movie', 'another', 'thing', 'unique', 'focus', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'witch', 'original', 'disney', 'film', 'one', 'character', 'scene', 'stealer', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'create', 'elsa', 'little', 'girl', 'come', 'life', 'help', 'anna', 'find', 'sister', 'like', 'warm', 'hug', 'frozen', 'good', 'movie', 'dark', 'sad', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'family']","[1, 40, 1047, 50, 249, 1442, 74, 10, 131, 249, 1442, 179, 658, 1034, 4590, 9, 35, 5, 1, 306, 696, 256, 44, 245, 467, 12, 39, 49, 649, 200, 42, 76, 4, 15, 7, 4, 589, 24, 134, 33, 39, 76, 19, 204, 134, 45, 10, 399, 3848, 7, 2521, 4, 24, 118, 491, 4, 24, 236, 14, 508, 498, 128, 47, 358, 4, 343, 19, 1375, 7, 1760, 4, 1528, 390, 82, 392, 138, 4, 1410, 128, 24, 1318, 841, 648, 264, 77, 105, 4, 233, 101, 214, 7, 135, 1908, 183, 67, 983, 1905, 181, 13, 221, 74, 158, 24, 340, 105, 858, 221, 205, 74, 86, 112, 36, 694, 162, 146, 7, 96, 706, 141, 116, 4, 144, 5, 512, 2, 1, 225, 229, 856, 469, 374, 11, 30, 13, 141, 116, 3, 26, 13, 374, 856, 469, 34, 38, 1, 102, 43, 414, 261, 153, 42, 15, 1385, 230, 2, 3, 10, 8, 90, 2409, 32, 45, 134, 4, 48, 76, 40, 79, 135, 7, 71, 15, 9, 362, 1236, 5, 17, 1, 628, 579, 91, 127, 72]"
900,8,"Well, everyone is obsessed with this film and, they are right, it is fantastic. Though I don't think its quite as good as say The Lion King or Aladdin but its still pretty damn awesome.The strongest point is the characters. Elsa is one of the best female leads in recent history. She's smart, compassionate and is conflicted having lived her whole life in fear. She also becomes queen, is not evil and does not end up with a love interest, being strong on her own. Anna was also really funny, and though there is a romance that occurs in only a few days (something that Disney has been criticized for) but its understandable because she has been locked away for so long. The other characters are all enjoyable and likable, Kristoff, Hans, the Duke, the reindeer; watch the film and you'll remember them all.I was originally against the fact that their was eventually a villain that is eventually revealed but it works because it shows the danger of what happens if you open up to quickly. That is a great lesson, especially in todays world since everyone wants to be in a relationship and with the rise of social media. The film also touches on the fact that people cannot shut themselves out and, at some point, we all need somebody. The songs, you remember them all and ""Let it Go"" easily makes my top 5 for best Disney songs.If I had any problems, its that the backstory is rushed and without giving away to much, there are many holes in the story. I guess it is Disney logic which can be pointed at any film. Overall Frozen had great characters and a great story. Not my personal favorite, but a favorite for many and I can see why.","['well', 'everyone', 'obsess', 'film', 'right', 'fantastic', 'though', 'think', 'quite', 'good', 'say', 'lion', 'king', 'aladdin', 'still', 'pretty', 'damn', 'awesome', 'strong', 'point', 'character', 'elsa', 'one', 'best', 'female', 'lead', 'recent', 'history', 'smart', 'compassionate', 'conflict', 'live', 'whole', 'life', 'fear', 'also', 'becomes', 'queen', 'evil', 'end', 'love', 'interest', 'strong', 'anna', 'also', 'really', 'funny', 'though', 'romance', 'occurs', 'day', 'something', 'disney', 'criticize', 'understandable', 'lock', 'away', 'long', 'character', 'enjoyable', 'likable', 'kristoff', 'han', 'duke', 'reindeer', 'watch', 'film', 'remember', 'originally', 'fact', 'eventually', 'villain', 'eventually', 'reveal', 'work', 'show', 'danger', 'happens', 'open', 'quickly', 'great', 'lesson', 'especially', 'today', 'world', 'since', 'everyone', 'want', 'relationship', 'rise', 'social', 'medium', 'film', 'also', 'touch', 'fact', 'people', 'shut', 'point', 'need', 'somebody', 'song', 'remember', 'let', 'go', 'easily', 'make', 'top', 'best', 'disney', 'song', 'problem', 'backstory', 'rush', 'without', 'give', 'away', 'much', 'many', 'hole', 'story', 'guess', 'disney', 'logic', 'point', 'film', 'overall', 'frozen', 'great', 'character', 'great', 'story', 'personal', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'many', 'see']","[18, 109, 1244, 3, 130, 253, 100, 37, 124, 17, 35, 152, 97, 485, 68, 136, 1480, 338, 167, 117, 8, 4, 10, 34, 237, 248, 399, 636, 1001, 3117, 552, 224, 127, 79, 187, 27, 380, 49, 277, 41, 6, 122, 167, 7, 27, 22, 85, 100, 363, 3231, 138, 89, 2, 1339, 2230, 382, 101, 169, 8, 306, 402, 67, 44, 762, 151, 23, 3, 391, 1511, 201, 652, 104, 652, 528, 107, 78, 901, 591, 318, 733, 25, 499, 121, 674, 126, 98, 109, 59, 153, 880, 1522, 1294, 3, 27, 260, 201, 46, 686, 117, 99, 1832, 11, 391, 30, 13, 403, 14, 239, 34, 2, 11, 198, 2408, 525, 137, 57, 101, 31, 61, 697, 12, 388, 2, 1464, 117, 3, 166, 5, 25, 8, 25, 12, 537, 189, 189, 61, 16]"

905,8,"Frozen. That movie that everyone says is best animated film in years (or ever!). The movie has great animation, has a nice art style, and is full of lots of heart-warming moments... but is it good?Even I'm not quite sure.Frozen is a peculiar movie to me because I can't even tell what I thought of it. The movie has some great character designs, animation, and funny diaolgue, but it also manages to fall under some cliché Disney tropes, has pointless songs that only kill time, and is VERY one dimensional at times.The premise of Frozen is that a girl named Elsa (who is a princess) has the power to create snow/ice. After nearly killing her sister Anna, she is forced into hiding and must live a dull and lonely life. This concept is actually GOOD. The parents are completely understanding of Elsa, Elsa understands the situation, is mature, and takes full responsibility. This is unique, because usually the ""powerful woman"" either seeks revenge, gets mad, or becomes power hungry. However, Elsa doesn't do any of those things. She remains relatively calm and tries to keep everyone safe, even after releasing her full potential.While Elsa is very interesting--along with Kristoff--Anna does reuse some common Disney traits... the quirky girl who wants love who can be serious at times but is generally laid back and fun loving. While this is nice and all, it would be a bit nicer to see a bit more original of a character. Hans... he isn't original at all... if anything he is forced, but his character does make a very important point in the movie.Do I need to talk about the songs? Everyone knows Let It Go by now, which is without a doubt the best song in the movie. The problem is that the rest of the songs in the movie don't hold up very well and sometimes seems like time-fillers. Overall, Frozen is a good animated movie, but I feel as if most of the movie's enjoyment comes from the nostalgia the movie serves. This movie FEELS like a classic 90s Disney movie. The songs sound similar, the three part act feels very familiar, the actions are predictable at times (except for Anna's final choice), and most of this movie... kind of rolls without thought. Things happen in the film, but nothing happens that it really ""unique"", ""original"", or ""outstanding"". The movie manages to pack in a lot of heart-warming moments but isn't that simply a cheap shot? Heart-warming moments DO NOT make a good movie. They are nice, but Disney uses them so much that I'm not quite sure if I can like the movie because of it.Long story short: Frozen is entertaining and original at times, but it also feels like a very flat and one-dimensional films at other times... and it borrows A LOT from previous Disney films.","['frozen', 'movie', 'everyone', 'say', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'year', 'ever', 'movie', 'great', 'animation', 'nice', 'art', 'style', 'full', 'lot', 'heart', 'warm', 'moment', 'good', 'even', 'quite', 'sure', 'frozen', 'peculiar', 'movie', 'even', 'tell', 'thought', 'movie', 'great', 'character', 'design', 'animation', 'funny', 'diaolgue', 'also', 'manages', 'fall', 'clich', 'disney', 'trope', 'pointless', 'song', 'kill', 'time', 'one', 'dimensional', 'time', 'premise', 'frozen', 'girl', 'name', 'elsa', 'princess', 'power', 'create', 'snow', 'ice', 'nearly', 'kill', 'sister', 'anna', 'force', 'hiding', 'must', 'live', 'dull', 'lonely', 'life', 'concept', 'actually', 'good', 'parent', 'completely', 'understand', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'understands', 'situation', 'mature', 'take', 'full', 'responsibility', 'unique', 'usually', 'powerful', 'woman', 'either', 'seek', 'revenge', 'get', 'mad', 'becomes', 'power', 'hungry', 'however', 'elsa', 'thing', 'remains', 'relatively', 'calm', 'try', 'keep', 'everyone', 'safe', 'even', 'release', 'full', 'potential', 'elsa', 'interest', 'along', 'kristoff', 'anna', 'reuse', 'common', 'disney', 'trait', 'quirky', 'girl', 'want', 'love', 'serious', 'time', 'generally', 'laid', 'back', 'fun', 'love', 'nice', 'would', 'bit', 'nicer', 'see', 'bit', 'original', 'character', 'han', 'original', 'anything', 'force', 'character', 'make', 'important', 'point', 'movie', 'need', 'talk', 'song', 'everyone', 'know', 'let', 'go', 'without', 'doubt', 'best', 'song', 'movie', 'problem', 'rest', 'song', 'movie', 'hold', 'well', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'like', 'time', 'filler', 'overall', 'frozen', 'good', 'animate', 'movie', 'feel', 'movie', 'enjoyment', 'come', 'nostalgia', 'movie', 'serf', 'movie', 'feel', 'like', 'classic', 'disney', 'movie', 'song', 'sound', 'similar', 'three', 'part', 'act', 'feel', 'familiar', 'action', 'predictable', 'time', 'except', 'anna', 'final', 'choice', 'movie', 'kind', 'roll', 'without', 'thought', 'thing', 'happen', 'film', 'nothing', 'happens', 'really', 'unique', 'original', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'manages', 'pack', 'lot', 'heart', 'warm', 'moment', 'simply', 'cheap', 'shot', 'heart', 'warm', 'moment', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'nice', 'disney', 'us', 'much', 'quite', 'sure', 'like', 'movie', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'frozen', 'entertain', 'original', 'time', 'also', 'feel', 'like', 'flat', 'one', 'dimensional', 'film', 'time', 'borrows', 'lot', 'previous', 'disney', 'film']","[5, 1, 109, 35, 34, 38, 3, 47, 81, 1, 25, 21, 192, 749, 355, 246, 84, 80, 362, 133, 17, 28, 124, 207, 5, 1, 28, 143, 92, 1, 25, 8, 424, 21, 85, 27, 825, 186, 274, 2, 1032, 898, 11, 286, 20, 10, 751, 20, 1222, 5, 76, 183, 4, 29, 24, 134, 39, 33, 501, 286, 15, 7, 272, 1744, 236, 224, 1026, 930, 79, 693, 103, 17, 118, 291, 216, 4, 4, 2696, 867, 1022, 55, 246, 1175, 414, 460, 439, 251, 353, 997, 19, 1314, 380, 24, 2687, 110, 4, 43, 1550, 1688, 3007, 87, 154, 109, 1174, 28, 288, 246, 685, 4, 122, 172, 67, 7, 2966, 999, 2, 1133, 908, 76, 59, 6, 835, 20, 1004, 3515, 74, 125, 6, 192, 26, 95, 3854, 16, 95, 230, 8, 44, 230, 212, 272, 8, 14, 289, 117, 1, 99, 178, 11, 109, 56, 30, 13, 137, 681, 34, 11, 1, 198, 303, 11, 1, 655, 18, 504, 75, 9, 20, 1504, 166, 5, 17, 38, 1, 53, 1, 1474, 40, 1677, 1, 1866, 1, 53, 9, 69, 2, 1, 11, 259, 446, 433, 94, 112, 53, 1077, 345, 331, 20, 474, 7, 817, 862, 1, 193, 985, 137, 92, 43, 290, 3, 156, 591, 22, 414, 230, 764, 1, 825, 2161, 84, 80, 362, 133, 341, 2886, 1103, 80, 362, 133, 14, 17, 1, 192, 2, 919, 31, 124, 207, 9, 1, 169, 12, 263, 5, 243, 230, 20, 27, 53, 9, 838, 10, 751, 3, 20, 3678, 84, 763, 2, 3]"
906,3,"I agree with others that Frozen is a gorgeous film. It looks and sounds great. What ruined the film for me is that the heroes/heroines, should not really be the heroes/heroines. Consider these points: 1) The girls' parents are actually the world's worst parents. ""Our child has superpowers. We must lock her up for her own good!"" In another film, they'd be vilified.2) Queen Elsa is horrible leader and has no business being queen. She ices over the kingdom, and when approached about it, she won't even try to fix it and is like ""Go away! Leave me alone!"" She also halts business with the kingdom's largest trading partner (who was actually attempting to fix the eternal-winter problem) out of spite. Portraying young princesses acting that way is one thing. But showing adult queens acting like that is quite another thing.3) Hans is actually the best leader, and would have made a good king. He steps up to action, takes care of the people, and demonstrates strong leadership. Sure, he's ambitious and plans a coup, but isn't that how kingdoms are made? These core problems with the story were enough to make me cringe throughout the movie, and I don't think sets a good example for the children in the target audience.","['agree', 'others', 'frozen', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'look', 'sound', 'great', 'ruin', 'film', 'hero', 'heroine', 'really', 'hero', 'heroine', 'consider', 'point', 'girl', 'parent', 'actually', 'world', 'bad', 'parent', 'child', 'superpower', 'must', 'lock', 'good', 'another', 'film', 'vilified', 'queen', 'elsa', 'horrible', 'leader', 'business', 'queen', 'ice', 'kingdom', 'approach', 'even', 'try', 'fix', 'like', 'go', 'away', 'leave', 'alone', 'also', 'halt', 'business', 'kingdom', 'large', 'trading', 'partner', 'actually', 'attempt', 'fix', 'eternal', 'winter', 'problem', 'spite', 'portray', 'young', 'princess', 'act', 'way', 'one', 'thing', 'show', 'adult', 'queen', 'act', 'like', 'quite', 'another', 'thing', 'han', 'actually', 'best', 'leader', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'king', 'step', 'action', 'take', 'care', 'people', 'demonstrates', 'strong', 'leadership', 'sure', 'ambitious', 'plan', 'coup', 'kingdom', 'make', 'core', 'problem', 'story', 'enough', 'make', 'cringe', 'throughout', 'movie', 'think', 'set', 'good', 'example', 'child', 'target', 'audience']","[729, 247, 5, 444, 3, 66, 259, 25, 851, 3, 544, 565, 22, 544, 565, 421, 117, 76, 118, 103, 126, 65, 118, 70, 3173, 236, 382, 17, 102, 3, 4892, 49, 4, 896, 1621, 1523, 49, 33, 77, 1111, 28, 87, 1012, 9, 13, 101, 322, 344, 27, 3137, 1523, 77, 977, 3971, 2446, 103, 448, 1012, 310, 105, 198, 1956, 1018, 73, 29, 112, 50, 10, 43, 78, 147, 49, 112, 9, 124, 102, 43, 44, 103, 34, 1621, 26, 14, 17, 97, 668, 345, 55, 293, 46, 3800, 167, 3247, 207, 2028, 776, 77, 14, 1399, 198, 12, 164, 14, 1929, 296, 1, 37, 144, 17, 396, 70, 1037, 159]"

Especially when her more normal, naïve sibling is old enough to not only engage the first guy she meets, but on the same day she meets him. That's when an extremely angry Elsa morphs the kingdom of Arendelle into eternal winter.The adventure improves once the adventure actually begins. After an overlong, somewhat ponderous prologue, Anna, our tomboy black sheep heroine, journeys to find Elsa, holed up in a giant ice castle atop a mountain far enough away for a worthy trek Here's where the characters worth developing are introducedHaving kept her charming fiancé at home, Anna is teamed with clumsy, sweet, subliminal love interest Kristoff who, with his pet reindeer Sven, interact like a frolicking version of Princess Leia, Han Solo and Chewbacca. But the scene-stealing comic relief is Josh Gad's neurotic snowman Olaf, providing genuine laughs while bringing the group closer together.There's an exciting homage to KING KONG when Anna and Kristoff confront a giant ice monster, summoned by Elsa, who yearns to remain a tortured, brooding recluse Meanwhile, Anna's slowly dying from her sister's curse and only an act of true love can save her.This perfectly melodramatic do-or-die element is both heartfelt and suspenseful, making FROZEN an above-average kid's movie that despite irritatingly uncatchy songs and a cliché money-hungry villain (albeit he's surpassed by an unexpected, more sinister foe) is a thoroughly fun ride to keep adults equally engaged.","['hill', 'alive', 'sound', 'bland', 'pop', 'song', 'corny', 'lyric', 'describe', 'could', 'easily', 'spoken', 'sung', 'character', 'interest', 'well', 'casual', 'viewer', 'might', 'think', 'first', 'frozen', 'computer', 'animate', 'disney', 'musical', 'two', 'sister', 'one', 'happens', 'ice', 'queen', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'power', 'revisit', 'first', 'narnia', 'film', 'although', 'particular', 'snowy', 'witch', 'good', 'deep', 'control', 'spell', 'especially', 'normal', 'na', 'sibling', 'old', 'enough', 'engage', 'first', 'guy', 'meet', 'day', 'meet', 'extremely', 'angry', 'elsa', 'morphs', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'eternal', 'winter', 'adventure', 'improves', 'adventure', 'actually', 'begin', 'overlong', 'somewhat', 'ponderous', 'prologue', 'anna', 'tomboy', 'black', 'sheep', 'heroine', 'journey', 'find', 'elsa', 'hole', 'giant', 'ice', 'castle', 'atop', 'mountain', 'far', 'enough', 'away', 'worthy', 'trek', 'character', 'worth', 'develop', 'introduce', 'kept', 'charm', 'fianc', 'home', 'anna', 'team', 'clumsy', 'sweet', 'subliminal', 'love', 'interest', 'kristoff', 'pet', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'interact', 'like', 'frolic', 'version', 'princess', 'leia', 'han', 'solo', 'chewbacca', 'scene', 'steal', 'comic', 'relief', 'josh', 'gad', 'neurotic', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'provide', 'genuine', 'laugh', 'bring', 'group', 'closer', 'together', 'excite', 'homage', 'king', 'kong', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'confront', 'giant', 'ice', 'monster', 'summon', 'elsa', 'yearns', 'remain', 'torture', 'brooding', 'recluse', 'meanwhile', 'anna', 'slowly', 'die', 'sister', 'curse', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'perfectly', 'melodramatic', 'die', 'element', 'heartfelt', 'suspenseful', 'make', 'frozen', 'average', 'kid', 'movie', 'despite', 'irritatingly', 'uncatchy', 'song', 'clich', 'money', 'hungry', 'villain', 'albeit', 'surpass', 'unexpected', 'sinister', 'foe', 'thoroughly', 'fun', 'ride', 'keep', 'adult', 'equally', 'engage']","[1930, 1301, 259, 811, 658, 11, 1737, 475, 1362, 54, 403, 1903, 684, 8, 122, 18, 5127, 479, 252, 37, 36, 5, 642, 38, 2, 51, 42, 15, 10, 591, 33, 49, 299, 1077, 24, 2714, 36, 2645, 3, 255, 650, 1218, 1385, 17, 574, 128, 858, 121, 873, 2777, 409, 64, 164, 619, 36, 148, 244, 138, 244, 423, 2162, 4, 77, 199, 310, 105, 326, 326, 103, 160, 4991, 572, 4090, 4885, 7, 4980, 1172, 4582, 565, 337, 71, 4, 697, 1171, 33, 168, 4671, 214, 142, 164, 101, 790, 2009, 8, 254, 917, 736, 498, 235, 1331, 533, 7, 486, 1262, 457, 3911, 6, 122, 67, 983, 151, 181, 2644, 9, 435, 29, 4713, 44, 1618, 90, 906, 309, 297, 275, 257, 3967, 45, 32, 458, 1342, 190, 221, 849, 2552, 332, 447, 2902, 97, 7, 67, 2648, 1171, 33, 495, 3329, 4, 3427, 1436, 1614, 2588, 1104, 7, 2743, 368, 15, 405, 112, 62, 6, 111, 456, 2145, 368, 401, 1402, 2797, 14, 5, 921, 60, 1, 313, 11, 274, 661, 2687, 104, 2277, 1445, 894, 4768, 1243, 125, 1305, 154, 147, 1169, 619]"

919,6,"I have to start by saying I thought the movie was fine, it was enjoyable and had plenty of cute moments and obviously kids love it. However, there were plenty of serious plot holes and issues that I had with the movie.First, what was Hans' plan? He appeared to want a throne and realized that he would never be king in his own country, so he planned to marry a princess closer to the throne. However, Anna was not queen and Hans had no knowledge of Elsa's powers or that she would leave. Was his plan to marry Anna and then kill Elsa so they would rule? Also, why was Hans left in charge when Elsa and Anna left, shouldn't whoever had been ruling prior to Elsa's coronation? If Hans was willing to kill for the throne, why not send men to kill Elsa and Anna as soon as he was given rule of Arendale. Hans was a cheap villain to create a hate-able man even though the real conflict was Elsa's unwillingness to open up to her sister.Time was also a very loose construct in Frozen. As soon as Elsa freezes everything, Anna follows her, but very quickly, everyone seems to know they are in eternal winter. There is no reason for them to know that the winter would be eternal after a few days. If it was longer, then I don't understand why Hans hadn't developed into a dictator over Arendale, which was clearly what that character wanted to do. No one plans to kill for the throne in order to be a benevolent king. Also, the really missed a chance to show Weaselton actually being an evil character, rather than just planning to be.There was a lot a wasted potential by Frozen's inability to develop a quality villain. Gone are the days of Disney's excellent villains like Jafar, Scar, and Maleficent. Instead, they were so desperate to have a man manipulate and backstab the protagonists that they failed to actually develop him.","['start', 'say', 'thought', 'movie', 'fine', 'enjoyable', 'plenty', 'cute', 'moment', 'obviously', 'kid', 'love', 'however', 'plenty', 'serious', 'plot', 'hole', 'issue', 'movie', 'first', 'han', 'plan', 'appear', 'want', 'throne', 'realize', 'would', 'never', 'king', 'country', 'plan', 'marry', 'princess', 'closer', 'throne', 'however', 'anna', 'queen', 'han', 'knowledge', 'elsa', 'power', 'would', 'leave', 'plan', 'marry', 'anna', 'kill', 'elsa', 'would', 'rule', 'also', 'han', 'left', 'charge', 'elsa', 'anna', 'left', 'whoever', 'ruling', 'prior', 'elsa', 'coronation', 'han', 'willing', 'kill', 'throne', 'send', 'men', 'kill', 'elsa', 'anna', 'soon', 'give', 'rule', 'arendale', 'han', 'cheap', 'villain', 'create', 'hate', 'able', 'man', 'even', 'though', 'real', 'conflict', 'elsa', 'unwillingness', 'open', 'sister', 'time', 'also', 'loose', 'construct', 'frozen', 'soon', 'elsa', 'freeze', 'everything', 'anna', 'follow', 'quickly', 'everyone', 'seem', 'know', 'eternal', 'winter', 'reason', 'know', 'winter', 'would', 'eternal', 'day', 'longer', 'understand', 'han', 'developed', 'dictator', 'arendale', 'clearly', 'character', 'want', 'one', 'plan', 'kill', 'throne', 'order', 'benevolent', 'king', 'also', 'really', 'miss', 'chance', 'show', 'weaselton', 'actually', 'evil', 'character', 'rather', 'planning', 'lot', 'waste', 'potential', 'frozen', 'inability', 'develop', 'quality', 'villain', 'go', 'day', 'disney', 'excellent', 'villain', 'like', 'jafar', 'scar', 'maleficent', 'instead', 'desperate', 'man', 'manipulate', 'backstab', 'protagonist', 'fail', 'actually', 'develop']","[120, 35, 92, 1, 470, 306, 727, 265, 133, 613, 60, 6, 110, 727, 835, 52, 697, 519, 1, 36, 44, 776, 582, 59, 952, 428, 26, 88, 97, 872, 776, 390, 29, 2552, 952, 110, 7, 49, 44, 2266, 4, 24, 26, 322, 776, 390, 7, 286, 4, 26, 788, 27, 44, 330, 807, 4, 7, 330, 1842, 2813, 1883, 4, 343, 44, 1549, 286, 952, 1968, 459, 286, 4, 7, 580, 57, 788, 3482, 44, 2886, 104, 134, 333, 294, 145, 28, 100, 195, 552, 4, 318, 15, 20, 27, 937, 3092, 5, 580, 4, 282, 132, 7, 378, 733, 109, 75, 56, 310, 105, 180, 56, 105, 26, 310, 138, 612, 216, 44, 610, 3482, 690, 8, 59, 10, 776, 286, 952, 496, 3973, 97, 27, 22, 271, 632, 78, 3295, 103, 277, 8, 191, 1888, 84, 644, 685, 5, 2545, 917, 283, 104, 13, 138, 2, 298, 104, 9, 3951, 878, 1902, 208, 1658, 145, 1343, 354, 1166, 103, 917]"

921,8,"The idea for Disneys #Frozen has been taken from the novel by Hans Christian Anderson, I'm not exactly sure how, but Disney are happily declaring that, anyhoo it is a Disney film so I'm sure you'll know the drill. Read ahead to the stars ***********************SPOILER TIME*************** Anna with the voice of Kristan Bell and older sister Elsa voiced by Idina Menzel﻿ start off as young, carefree, happy princesses (I did say it was Disney) Whilst playing Elsa accidentally hurt her younger sibling with the magic she possesses. I know. It's for kids, come one. Anyway because of this accident Elsa banishes herself from her sister, society and her parents. Parents are then killed when a ship sinks, which then makes Elsa, Queen. During the coronation Elsa slips up and causes quite a storm (pun intended) with her magical powers. Elsa disappears and so Anna goes in pursuit. Yadda, yadda, yadda, picks up a helper along the way she falls in love with. The lovable character called Olaf is injected into the Disney and that Disney magic we all know comes to life. I won't ruin the end for you, but needless to say you will groan when you hear the typical line.*******************SPOILER OVER******************Being a computer animated film the characters are as usual well suited to the voices and I was shocked at the singing voices of all the characters Kristoff is voiced by Jonathan Groff who you might know as Jesse St James in Glee. Josh Gad is the lovable snowman Olaf, which is the character in all the trailers. The characters compliment each other fantastically well and it feels like they take queues from their computer generated characters. Can't really talk about the specials much as it's a computer generated, but I will say that Disney have definitely gone all out. after the success of Wreck-It-Ralph it looks like Disney animation have really pushed the limits on this film in regards to making the snow seem so amazingly life like it's flawless. The script is regularly injected with magical Disney songs. I'm guessing it will translate very easily to a Broadway show. There are very funny parts for the big and little kids. So,8/10 for Disneys holiday film. It is worth taking the kids to see it, the little people in the cinema loved it.

922,8,"So today I went to the cinema for the official opening of Disney's latest Frozen(6th Dec 2013) where I'm from in Ireland. So Frozen is Disney's second CGI fairytale after Disney's Tangled,and is their 53rd animated classic from the Disney canon. The movie is about two sisters; one who has magical powers that she controls using her hands named Elsa (voice by Enchanted star and Broadway singer Idina Menzel)who is afraid to open up to people because of the curse(which I had NO idea how she got them in the first place),while the other is a quirky beautiful red head named Anna(voiced by Forgetting Sarah Marshall star Kirsten Bell)who believes in true love and wants to marry a handsome prince(oh jeez does THAT SOUND FAMILIAR...coughs The Little Mermaid,Enchanted etc).Anna does however fall for a handsome prince named Hans Prince of the Southern Isles(voiced by and sung by Santino Fontana ANOTHER Broadway singer) who sweeps Anna off her feet and they sing a High School Musical number Love Is An Open Door. Meanwhile Anna tells Elsa she is getting hitched but Elsa doesn't want to hear of it as she is afraid that Anna is rushing into love.What Anna doesn't know however is that Elsa accidentally caused an accident involving Anna as a kid and which made Anna get her memories wiped out completely and it wasn't until the coronation when the big reveal on her powers was revealed to everyone including the duke(voiced by Alan Tudayk), which leads to Elsa runs away. So Anna goes in search of Elsa and teams up with a stocky built ice farmer named Kristoff(aka Christopher, voiced by Johnathan Groff)and accompanying him is his dog- like reindeer(who I swear acts like Maximus from Tangled)called Sven who cracks me up in this movie.They later meet a hilarious snowman called Olaf(voiced by Josh Gad from Ice Age 4)who dreams of summer. As Anna and Kristoff go in search of Anna's sister Elsa will they ever let her become free and face her fears on her powers?Now after all this talk you wanna know what I loved about the film well lets just say this OMG THIS FILM WAS actually good,its not like Tangled AT ALL compare to what people said it was and in fact its actually the best since Disney's 50th and here is why. The animation was gorgeous especially the scene where Elsa sings Let It Go as she builds an ice castle for herself. THAT scene just blew me away I was shocked by how awe-inspiring this scene was including the song which is definitely Oscar worthy. The score which is done by Christopher Beck(who did A Cinderella Story's score)was excellent. The minute the instrumental(which sounded like it was from The Lion King) started playing instead of the When You Wish Upon A Star theme for Disney I was blown away in fact I can't get it out of my head IT WAS THAT GOOD. Another thing I liked about this movie was the chemistry between the two sisters, in fact I literally got a bit teary eyed especially one scene near the end of the film where a certain charcther sacrifices their life for another charcther.I also love the following characters; Sven,Olaf,Anna,Kristoff and Elsa(Elsa you feel so bad for her and you hate her to be so isolated with herself because of her powers). SO after this brilliant set up you think it beats Tangled off my no 1 list and into my top 5 right? Well there are some problems.#1.The villain twist and the real identity of the villain in this movie was shocking.When I found out half way through the film that this person was the villain I was raging when the villain revealed him/herself. I was like what the heck Disney?#2 The songs now don't get me wrong I loved Let It Go,For The First Time In Forever and In Summer as well as Reindeer's are better than people, but the song Love Is An Open Door GOD it was so mediocre I almost felt like I was watching a High School Musical movie and the song was like sung by Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron,but I did have a soft spot for it. #3 The songs came out of nowhere and I felt that the movie focused on the songs rather than the actual story itself. Another flaw I had was on Elsa and her powers.Part of me was like how did she get these powers, who gave them to her,how can she stop the curse? Kristoff had no backstory either and I was praying that we'd get to know more on his past but we didn't and I was so disappointed in it.The chemistry between Anna and Kristoff wasn't as believable as Rapunzel & Eugene's in Tangled as you knew Eugene loved Rapunzel in Tangled,here it was kinda not on the same level as that because I felt that Anna's real love wasn't who he was AT ALL and she just used Kristoff as second base. But still for what it is Frozen is an outstanding Disney movie from the very beginning with the ice harvesters digging the ice from the ground with The Great Thaw song playing in the background, to the grand finale which was epic in its own rights.Probably the best Disney movie in the last 3 years for me.If you love a movie that's dramatic and serious that has less laughs watch Frozen,but if you love a good love story/swashbuckling adventure movie with excellent chemistry between the two love leads and good laughs than watch Tangled. Overall I was going to give this a 9 out of 10 but ask me in another couple of years and I might get the jest of it. But its in my 11th spot of all time fav movies.","['today', 'go', 'cinema', 'official', 'opening', 'disney', 'late', 'frozen', 'th', 'dec', 'ireland', 'frozen', 'disney', 'second', 'cgi', 'fairytale',

This almost leads to tragedy for her sister and causes the former to go into a self-imposed exile while her kingdom freezes over.Funny that this tale of woe ends with the queen never getting a guy while the sister had two opportunities. Treachery abounds and it's shocking to see who is involved in this evil. Of course, there are parents, the king and queen who are lost at sea to bring further misery and mayhem to the situation.The singing voices,especially by Idina Menzel are wonderful and the songs are catchy.","['utterly', 'inane', 'farce', 'princess', 'ability', 'keep', 'thing', 'mighty', 'cold', 'lead', 'kingdom', 'described', 'perpetual', 'winter', 'almost', 'lead', 'tragedy', 'sister', 'cause', 'former', 'go', 'self', 'impose', 'exile', 'kingdom', 'freeze', 'funny', 'tale', 'woe', 'end', 'queen', 'never', 'get', 'guy', 'sister', 'two', 'opportunity', 'treachery', 'abounds', 'shock', 'see', 'involve', 'evil', 'course', 'parent', 'king', 'queen', 'lose', 'sea', 'bring', 'far', 'misery', 'mayhem', 'situation', 'sing', 'voice', 'especially', 'idina', 'menzel', 'wonderful', 'song', 'catchy']","[1209, 3026, 29, 367, 154, 43, 2664, 366, 248, 77, 2516, 1437, 105, 173, 248, 2905, 15, 328, 1662, 13, 429, 5137, 1602, 77, 282, 85, 114, 5081, 41, 49, 88, 19, 148, 15, 42, 759, 3491, 666, 16, 584, 277, 228, 118, 97, 49, 489, 1002, 221, 142, 3134, 4507, 867, 63, 86, 121, 141, 116, 215, 11, 266]"
924,10,"The Frozen makes my Daughter FreezesI haven't watched any Disney movies for a long time because nothing appealed to me personally after the 90's. I watched Frozen after listening to my daughter singing to one of the songs from the movie, ""Let It Go."" It was a great movie. If you have kids, this movie is especially perfect. It kept my daughter fully entertained both visually and musically. My two and a half year old daughter sat on the couch all throughout watching Frozen without moving around for the first time ever! Disney's ""happily ever after"" template has embraced the modern era, as the bond between sisters is relatable and relevant to a younger audience; this is dynamic is enhanced by cutting edge CGI effects and addicting melodies, where no child can possibly resist.The story of frozen is rooted in the Disney tradition of a warm family movie. Anna, the princess, shows blind love to her sister, Elsa, the queen, who has special magical powers that freezes everything. This movie shows that the love and bond between two sisters can overcome any barriers. When Elsa ran away to the ice castle, only Anna could convince her sister to go back to their home town of Arendelle, Anna said that even though Anna lost her memory that Elsa has a special power, Anna was not scared of Elsa's power. Anna trusts Elsa's sincere desire to not hurt people. It was just an accident, after the town's people discovered Elsa's power. I think this is great example for children who have siblings. This shows that siblings are best friends to each other and they trust and support one another even if they are in a bad situation. I think this describes the meaning of family through sister hood from Elsa and Anna. Also, Olaf, the snow man, is a very cute character with humor that really inspires and holds onto kids' attention and imagination.The music was awesome throughout the movie. ""For the First Time Forever"" was my favorite because Anna was so sincere when singing to Elsa to go back to Arendelle, the town where they are from. I felt I was there with them and the scene was incredibly immersive. Overall, the rhythms, melody and words in the music were easy to remember and addictive. Even my daughter has been singing her favorite song from the movie, ""Let It Go,"" all the time. ""Let It Go"" is her favorite song ever, even if she can only sing those three words over and over again. The special effects were incredible. When Elsa was singing ""Let It Go"", the animated sprinkling of snow during the ice castle's construction was very detailed. The details of snowflakes and the large scale background supported each other's effects to be conspicuous. This makes me want to watch this movie in 3D. Also, Olaf's private winter at the end of movie was cute. When the weather turned into summer, Elsa did not want to see Olaf melt away. She conjured a self-contained snowfall for the snowman to enjoy. It was Olaf's personal winter, with cloud and snowflakes looming above only him. This idea of the private clouds and snowflakes were great with touches of special effects. This makes I want to have one of my own.There were so many subtle shades of blue in this movie. The concept of the movie is frozen, like ice, but they used slightly different hues of blue mixed with purple. Anna's cape and eye make-up colors follow the subtle blend of colors which makes one feel cold and warm simultaneously. There were also lots of different shades of dark green. Dark green, combined with purple makes some scenes feel classical and royal such as the party scene. The mystic shade of blue of Elsa's ice dress is reflected beautifully by her ice castle. These dynamic colors interested my daughter a lot. The colors draw in the kids and create a mystique around the entire story. It's really quite amazing how the transformation of colors parallels the twists and turns of the story. The only negative thing is that this movie was too short. I want to watch it more, and listen to more music. I truly enjoyed everything about this movie.What a great twist on the traditional Disney model of the ""everything is going to be okay"" ending. Of course it did end that way. However, the film veered away from the traditional ""Beauty and the Beast"" endings in which the lead character finds love between a man and a woman, and through that saves the day. What saves both the sisters in this movie was their love for each other. I think it truly reflects a genuine evolution by Disney, but also a reflection of Disney's' understanding of today's culture. This is what makes Disney so great: ex: Snow White – the traditional love between a man and women. Beauty and the Beast – love transgressing beyond physical beauty. Lion King – love between father and son. Toy Story – love of best friends, be it human ones or toy ones. Disney and this movie have captured a new angle of love that I believe is particularly effective for the 21st century audience.","['frozen', 'make', 'daughter', 'freezesi', 'watch', 'disney', 'movie',

925,10,"Honestly, since seeing tangled, nothing has lived up to the expectations set by it. I loved tangled. The characters, the music and the plot. Frozen had completely matched it. The story line had me captivated. The ice scenes were magical and just stunning. Everything thing about the scenery was warming (despite it being frozen :P) and it just looked so beautiful. Olaf was hilarious! I generally don't like the annoying side kicks that are usually cringe not funny, but Olaf (like pascal in tangled) was an exception! I laughed out loud at his jokes, and being an 18 year old in a theatre full of children shows that this film has definitely got the potential to make anyone giggle. I took my little brother with me and he loved every bit and he was surprised by how much he liked it as he thought it was going to be girly. The two main characters were brilliant, Elsa was a great character, she was very mysterious and different to most Disney princesses where as Anna just felt so relatable, she wasn't perfect. The scene where her hair is all messy in the morning made me laugh because its just like me! This film actually made me appreciate my sister more. Although the only downside would be the copious amounts of singing but I have actually downloaded ""let it go"" (both the Menzel and lovato version) as it was such a breath taking song. This is a MUST see film.

926,1,"This is THE MOST overrated movie of all time. There, I said it.This is so beloved by kids and teenage girls everywhere that from the way they talk about it you'd think God himself had come to them and told them that this movie is the one true faith, that's the level of love they give to it. That love is misplaced. Let's look briefly at why.The plot sees two princesses and one, Elsa, is about to become The Queen but has ice powers and freezes the kingdom putting it into perpetual winter. Why does she have these powers again? The movie never bothers to explain. Anyway, she runs away in fear for her life and sings THAT song. You know the one. The one so annoying that its writer has issued an official apology for it. We are supposed to be sympathetic towards her plight but she's been such a *female canine* towards her sister that it's difficult to feel anything but a feeling of 'Serves You Right, You Meanie'.But she's not even the worst character in this movie. I'll admit to writing several fan-fiction pieces devising unpleasant ways to kill the abomination that is Olaf (my personal favourite is called ""Do You Want To Kill A Snowman?"") but at least he serves a purpose in the story sort of. Once, JUST ONCE, I'd like to see a Disney movie where the 'wacky sidekick' character (Disney's phrasing) is not annoying and actually manages to be funny. Olaf makes even Jar Jar Binks tolerable! And that's before we get to the Rock Trolls.All that and anti-male sexism too! Every man in the film is one of three things: Idiotic, Evil or Foolish (Kristof, Hans and The King respectively). The closest the male audience gets to a decent role model is Olaf and you know there's a problem when that happens. Speaking of the evil man for a moment, Hans is so at odds with his earlier character traits when he is revealed to be the villain it's almost as if the writers got to the last half-hour or so and realised ""Quick! We haven't got a villain yet!"". He's probably the least interesting villain in Disney history.To reiterate what I said in my summary: What was branded as the best Disney since the 'The Lion King' actually feels more in keeping with everything Disney has been churning out since then.

927,2,"First of all, the film is just highly predictable from the first few scenes. If you watch the trailer, watch the films first scenes where *spoilers* Anna and Elsa play around in the snow and the trolls use ""magic"" to make Anna lose her memory, then Kristoff follows them, you can tell ""Kristoff and Anna find love in the end. Obviously telling us they have a bond, that somewhat made them find each other (they don't, but it's subliminal messaging)."" Secondly, there are, practically, 5 settings, two of which are only important and/or interesting. The town (forgot the name), Elsa's castle (that's it on the two), the store, the troll's hideout and the wilderness. The store has about two minutes of viewing time, the wilderness has about 5, and the troll hideout has about 10 overall. The rest of the film is in Elsa's castle or the town/city. The plot moves along nicely, but the reused set pieces, places that you get there, get away from there then repeat this 10 times over makes the plot seem like it's actually not moving at all! Thirdly, the plot lines/holes are totally inconvenient and stupid. They should've learned from comic books, that you have to explain how this works (meaning comic books don't explain how they work, and that's why people cringe at them today)! Elsa's powers are hidden by love, wait, so what did her parents do then? Elsa just sent you into a kind of nuclear winter just now, f**k it, she can be our queen. Elsa can create snow and ice, we'll give her, somehow, the power to create life, just so we can put an immature snowman in it and a big abominable snowman, because of reasons! We'll put men in here just to show love, because they are all incompetent a******s who make no progression in the story, whatsoever! Next, all the characters, apart from the main 4, are bland, boring or cringeworthy from how stupid and childish they are. The duke has a bland tone and is nosey and bossy. That's it? This character seems like an antagonist type, but seriously? That's all we learn about him. + he is in it, goes to Elsa's castle, nearly dies but Hans convinces her not to (I think this happens) then he magically disappears, never to be seen again. The soldiers could at least have been funny and clumsy, but no, they just stand there, do what they told and guess what? They magically disappear too! They've taken almost every aspect that could've made the movie funny, you know to actually appeal to the target market, but they skip it all. The law and order in this time is screwed up as well. ""Your acting queen is dead, so I'm married to her, no need to see any documents, so I'll be king now."" And Hans says to Elsa (practically) ""don't kill that man! I just met your sister and tried to get married to her and you didn't approve because you don't know me. Now, since you don't know me, follow me back to your home so I can chain you up and behead you, OK?"" If you're going to make a kid's film, make it a tiny bit educational, please? These also lead to easily avoidable plot holes that, since there are so many, take every bit of enjoyment out of the film. For example: Elsa makes a massive winter, almost killing everyone, so they make her queen again in the end. They tell everyone (Elsa is nice) but Hans is nasty (included with the last point, nobody would trust Elsa and everyone thinks Anna is dead, but she comes back so they were lying to them, also taking off trust points) and everyone believes them. Elsa's powers can create life, unexplainably. There are no wizards and there is nothing in Elsa's parents genes to make her have these powers. This can't happen because of the genes screwing up, because that makes Down syndrome and cystic fibrosis, also unexplained. The winter instantly surpasses and everyone gets on with their lives in supposedly days, forgetting about the events entirely. Olaf doesn't melt before Elsa gives him the cloud. Anna almost freezes to death in a cold room, but feels the same way in a massive storm. Not feeling worse in any way. Somehow, Anna's horse finds it's way back, a duke who has nothing to do with the town can dish out orders, now one slips in a massive castle of ice or on an icy pond etc.. This film is good for a day where you relax and don't think, but if you're going to look for a film with an intricate and intriguing plot, with a twist (that isn't predictable) then this isn't for you. They explain nothing towards why anything happens, it just does. Worst Disney movie ever IMO. + it's highly overrated.","['first', 'film', 'highly', 'predictable', 'first', 'scene', 'watch', 'trailer', 'watch', 'film', 'first', 'scene', 'spoiler', 'anna', 'elsa',

928,4,"The hype of Frozen is what eventually made me decide to watch it and I wish I hadn't. It was an enormous waste of time. The two main characters are essentially the exact same and the story cuts every corner it can to reach the conclusion. The Characters had absolutely no build up and I found myself honestly not caring about any of them. They had no real development and the majority of the story doesn't even feature the main character. Early in the story Elsa's sister goes on a search to find Elsa after Elsa runs off. She leaves a guy she JUST MET in charge of the castle while she's gone and takes off. The guy she left in charge is never really shown or heard from until the very end of the film where he ""betrays"" Elsa's sister by telling her she doesn't lover her. He goes on to explain how he ""had it all planned out"" in a very cliché and stupid poorly written villain dialogue. Then there was Olaf the snowman, who literally served NO purpose in the film whatsoever. He was intended as comedic relief, but he just came off as an annoying fly that buzzed on screen a few times.The viewers have ABSOLUTELY no reason to care about what happens to the main characters nor do they have a reason to want them to succeed or for the ""villain"" to fail. There honestly really wasn't a villain or driving point to this story. Things were just happening and then things ended. The main point I'm bashing it for was that it DID NOT HAVE A DAMN PLOT. I could literally sum up what happened for you right here and you could pass a test on it.-Elsa and her sister are kids and they're playing. Oops! Elsa hit her sister with her ice powers by accident so they wipe her sisters memory and Elsa hides her powers.-Oh no! Her powers get revealed years later and she runs away because people call her a monster! Such tragic!-Her sister leaves douchebag in charge of city while she goes searching for Elsa-She meets a ice salesmen (Who randomly becomes a love interest in the last 5 minutes of the film) who helps her find Elsa-Elsa kicks them out because she's emotional.-Soldiers raid Elsa's ice castle, knock her out, she's captured. Oh no!-Douchebag tells the sister he doesn't really love her (big shocker) and tries to kill Elsa, Elsa escaped.-Sappy emotional scene that was poorly done freezes the sister and an ""ACT OF TRUE LOVE"" fixes everything in the entire world AND EVERYONE LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER AWWW SOO CUUUUTTTTTEEEEEEE!There. This film sucks, don't watch it.","['hype', 'frozen', 'eventually', 'make', 'decide', 'watch', 'wish', 'enormous', 'waste', 'time', 'two', 'main', 'character', 'essentially', 'exact', 'story', 'cut', 'every', 'corner', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'character', 'absolutely', 'build', 'found', 'honestly', 'care', 'real', 'development', 'majority', 'story', 'even', 'feature', 'main', 'character', 'early', 'story', 'elsa', 'sister', 'go', 'search', 'find', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'run', 'leaf', 'guy', 'met', 'charge', 'castle', 'go', 'take', 'guy', 'left', 'charge', 'never', 'really', 'show', 'heard', 'end', 'film', 'betrays', 'elsa', 'sister', 'tell', 'lover', 'go', 'explain', 'plan', 'clich', 'stupid', 'poorly', 'write', 'villain', 'dialogue', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'literally', 'serve', 'purpose', 'film', 'whatsoever', 'intend', 'comedic', 'relief', 'come', 'annoy', 'fly', 'buzz', 'screen', 'time', 'viewer', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'care', 'happens', 'main', 'character', 'reason', 'want', 'succeed', 'villain', 'fail', 'honestly', 'really', 'villain', 'drive', 'point', 'story', 'thing', 'happen', 'thing', 'end', 'main', 'point', 'bashing', 'damn', 'plot', 'could', 'literally', 'sum', 'happen', 'right', 'could', 'pas', 'test', 'elsa', 'sister', 'kid', 'play', 'oops', 'elsa', 'hit', 'sister', 'ice', 'power', 'accident', 'wipe', 'sister', 'memory', 'elsa', 'hide', 'power', 'oh', 'power', 'get', 'reveal', 'year', 'later', 'run', 'away', 'people', 'call', 'monster', 'tragic', 'sister', 'leaf', 'douchebag', 'charge', 'city', 'go', 'search', 'elsa', 'meet', 'ice', 'salesman', 'randomly', 'becomes', 'love', 'interest', 'last', 'minute', 'film', 'help', 'find', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'kick', 'emotional', 'soldier', 'raid', 'elsa', 'ice', 'castle', 'knock', 'capture', 'oh', 'douchebag', 'tell', 'sister', 'really', 'love', 'big', 'shocker', 'try', 'kill', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'escape', 'sappy', 'emotional', 'scene', 'poorly', 'freeze', 'sister', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'fix', 'everything', 'entire', 'world', 'everyone', 'life', 'happily', 'ever', 'awww', 'soo', 'cuuuuttttteeeeeee', 'film', 'suck', 'watch']","[406, 5, 652, 14, 491, 23, 417, 2460, 644, 20, 42, 119, 8, 1668, 1392, 12, 723, 115, 1983, 1046, 734, 8, 292, 202, 231, 542, 293, 195, 356, 1163, 12, 28, 229, 119, 8, 594, 12, 4, 15, 13, 793, 71, 4, 4, 233, 586, 148, 392, 807, 168, 13, 55, 148, 330, 807, 88, 22, 78, 357, 41, 3, 4, 15, 143, 1350, 13, 400, 776, 274, 494, 1125, 165, 104, 719, 32, 45, 643, 1173, 646, 3, 1978, 913, 1043, 297, 40, 238, 2082, 2017, 369, 20, 479, 292, 180, 293, 591, 119, 8, 180, 59, 1101, 104, 1166, 542, 22, 104, 1192, 117, 12, 43, 290, 43, 41, 119, 117, 1958, 1480, 52, 54, 643, 1404, 290, 130, 54, 1204, 1279, 4, 15, 60, 204, 4, 234, 15, 33, 24, 480, 1702, 15, 412, 4, 676, 24, 425, 24, 19, 528, 47, 358, 233, 101, 46, 308, 495, 1493, 15, 586, 5143, 807, 1389, 13, 793, 4, 244, 33, 1443, 2327, 380, 6, 122, 197, 211, 3, 135, 71, 4, 4, 1699, 342, 2100, 4, 33, 168, 1138, 611, 425, 5143, 143, 15, 22, 6, 106, 4508, 87, 286, 4, 4, 950, 2175, 342, 90, 1125, 282, 15, 112, 62, 6, 1012, 132, 264, 126, 109, 79, 795, 81, 3, 1202, 23]"
929,5,"First I am not saying that Frozen in a bad movie, in fact I thought the animation was impressive and creative and that's certainly the strongest part of the movie. I thought that half the songs were incredibly pointless and some parts just felt like filler. There were a bunch of fantastic songs and some were even remember able. I believe the weakest part of the story was the characters and the plot, the plot is centred around the ice queen substitute and what her fear influencing her power to harm others.There was no real antagonist which possibly would have gave greater heavier weight to the story which really does seem to be lacking, when there is no clear antagonist, there is no gravity to the situation. The characters were all either bland or really annoying, the main protagonist is the usual stereotypical quirky dork that seems to be accident pro. The twist at the end was extremely weak and anti-climactic, the twist being that the person who the main protagonist has fallen for is actually a power hungry villain. The antagonist is extremely forgettable and only the over-hyping super fans would probably remember the name. At one point the movie pokes fun at three of the Disney Formula's oldest and most famous Cliché's which is 'love at first site' and 'the prince will save the day' and 'first love's first kiss will conquer all' but it just seems to be Disney's reaction to officially stating that it recognises that times have changed and is more of an out of place, unnatural, forth wall joke, pandering to a main stream audience.There were many characters that were just plain forgettable such as the Scandinavian looking merchandise store on the outskirts of nowhere, just to be forgotten as soon as he arrives so it appears more like a short family guy sketch then a full in depth character, this was just a simple distraction and regular filler until the story continues on with the weak plot. Talking of weak and forgettable characters, what did you think of the gnomes that appeared twice? The story was very weak with little explanation of the Queen's duties, how this world functions? The origin of her power? The limitations of her power? Whether the power is Genetic or whether there was a prophecy or any background at all of how she got these powers or how the gnomes relate to all this?. Anyway Papa Gnome tells them that the young Ice Queen substitute that she will be unable to control her power if she has fear but he doesn't explain how he knows this. After this Papa Gnome wipes the main protagonists memory but doesn't explain his power, limitations, origin or purpose or there relation to the royal family in anyway at all. A weak plot all round, very disappointing. You have to really respect Disney for changing up the formula but even still there appears to be cliché's in the story such as the light relief merchandising snowman and his never ending story arc of whether the Reindeer will eat the attached carrot nose, (very important to the story). The other is a very familiar Disney cliché's of the parents dying and every central character is an orphan, (the mentality seems to be if formula is not broken don't fix it).In conclusion I can only say that the animation was incredible and some songs were as equally amazing but where Frozen falls short is the annoying, bland and some forgettable characters, the gnomes come to mind. The story has a very weak plot although a new spin on the story and it was good to see Disney change it's grand old formula but the hype doesn't do this movie credit and should be seen for what this movie is which is an OK movie with some great bits.","['first', 'say', 'frozen', 'bad', 'movie', 'fact', 'thought', 'animation', 'impressive', 'creative', 'certainly', 'strong', 'part', 'movie', 'thought', 'half', 'song', 'incredibly', 'pointless', 'part', 'felt', 'like', 'filler', 'bunch', 'fantastic', 'song', 'even', 'remember', 'able', 'believe', 'weak', 'part', 'story', 'character', 'plot', 'plot', 'centre', 'around', 'ice', 'queen', 'substitute', 'fear', 'influence', 'power', 'harm', 'others', 'real', 'antagonist', 'possibly', 'would', 'give', 'great', 'heavier', 'weight', 'story', 'really', 'seem', 'lack', 'clear', 'antagonist', 'gravity', 'situation', 'character', 'either', 'bland', 'really', 'annoy', 'main', 'protagonist', 'usual', 'stereotypical', 'quirky', 'dork', 'seem', 'accident', 'pro', 'twist', 'end', 'extremely', 'weak', 'anti', 'climactic', 'twist', 'person', 'main', 'protagonist', 'fall', 'actually', 'power', 'hungry', 'villain', 'antagonist', 'extremely', 'forgettable', 'hype', 'super', 'fan', 'would', 'probably', 'remember', 'name', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'poke', 'fun', 'three', 'disney', 'formula', 'old', 'famous', 'clich', 'love', 'first', 'site', 'prince', 'save', 'day', 'first', 'love', 'first', 'kiss', 'conquer', 'seem', 'disney', 'reaction', 'officially', 'state', 'recognises', 'time', 'change', 'place', 'unnatural', 'forth', 'wall', 'joke', 'pander', 'main', 'stream', 'audience', 'many', 'character', 'plain', 'forgettable', 'scandinavian', 'look', 'merchandise', 'store', 'outskirt', 'nowhere', 'forgotten', 'soon', 'arrives', 'appear', 'like', 'short', 'family', 'guy', 'sketch', 'full', 'depth', 'character', 'simple', 'distraction', 'regular', 'filler', 'story', 'continue', 'weak', 'plot', 'talk', 'weak', 'forgettable', 'character', 'think', 'gnome', 'appear', 'twice', 'story', 'weak', 'little', 'explanation', 'queen', 'duty', 'world', 'function', 'origin', 'power', 'limitation', 'power', 'whether', 'power', 'genetic', 'whether', 'prophecy', 'background', 'get', 'power', 'gnome', 'relate', 'anyway', 'papa', 'gnome', 'tell', 'young', 'ice', 'queen', 'substitute', 'unable', 'control', 'power', 'fear', 'explain', 'know', 'papa', 'gnome', 'wipe', 'main', 'protagonist', 'memory', 'explain', 'power', 'limitation', 'origin', 'purpose', 'relation', 'royal', 'family', 'anyway', 'weak', 'plot', 'round', 'disappoint', 'really', 'respect', 'disney', 'change', 'formula', 'even', 'still', 'appear', 'clich', 'story', 'light', 'relief', 'merchandising', 'snowman', 'never', 'end', 'story', 'arc', 'whether', 'reindeer', 'eat', 'attach', 'carrot', 'nose', 'important', 'story', 'familiar', 'disney', 'clich', 'parent', 'die', 'every', 'central', 'character', 'orphan', 'mentality', 'seem', 'formula', 'broken', 'fix', 'conclusion', 'say', 'animation', 'incredible', 'song', 'equally', 'amaze', 'frozen', 'fall', 'short', 'annoy', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'character', 'gnome', 'come', 'mind', 'story', 'weak', 'plot', 'although', 'new', 'spin', 'story', 'good', 'see', 'disney', 'change', 'grand', 'old', 'formula', 'hype', 'movie', 'credit', 'see', 'movie', 'ok', 'movie', 'great', 'bit']","[36, 35, 5, 65, 1, 201, 92, 21, 933, 1014, 442, 167, 94, 1, 92, 346, 11, 603, 898, 94, 155, 9, 1504, 1211, 253, 11, 28, 391, 294, 220, 434, 94, 12, 8, 52, 52, 2187, 200, 33, 49, 3210, 187, 1484, 24, 709, 247, 195, 634, 842, 26, 57, 25, 2280, 12, 22, 75, 273, 871, 634, 2870, 867, 8, 353, 811, 22, 238, 119, 354, 562, 1567, 908, 75, 480, 1319, 129, 41, 423, 434, 1273, 3235, 129, 441, 119, 354, 186, 103, 24, 2687, 104, 634, 423, 660, 406, 998, 176, 26, 210, 391, 183, 10, 117, 1, 1794, 125, 433, 2, 534, 64, 903, 274, 6, 36, 2388, 82, 111, 138, 36, 6, 36, 372, 4132, 75, 2, 1653, 2165, 881, 20, 209, 188, 2433, 1761, 1201, 451, 5047, 119, 3279, 159, 61, 8, 915, 660, 1089, 66, 949, 1223, 801, 1017, 580, 3011, 582, 9, 263, 72, 148, 3884, 246, 609, 8, 516, 1860, 1466, 1504, 12, 647, 434, 52, 178, 434, 660, 8, 37, 2906, 582, 1227, 12, 434, 48, 806, 49, 2857, 126, 2887, 2330, 24, 2493, 24, 638, 24, 3061, 638, 3727, 617, 19, 24, 2906, 785, 497, 3979, 2906, 143, 73, 33, 49, 3210, 1178, 128, 24, 187, 400, 56, 3979, 2906, 1702, 119, 354, 412, 400, 24, 2493, 2330, 646, 1635, 870, 72, 497, 434, 52, 911, 808, 22, 1311, 2, 209, 534, 28, 68, 582, 274, 12, 735, 297, 2420, 45, 88, 41, 12, 1529, 638, 151, 2612, 1764, 1146, 971, 289, 12, 1077, 2, 274, 118, 368, 115, 1061, 8, 2291, 5056, 75, 534, 1245, 1012, 734, 35, 21, 549, 11, 1169, 96, 5, 186, 263, 238, 811, 660, 8, 2906, 40, 320, 12, 434, 52, 255, 108, 2387, 12, 17, 16, 2, 209, 936, 64, 534, 406, 1, 662, 16, 1, 477, 1, 25, 95]"
930,4,"Okay, so the movie Frozen. Cute adorable cartoon musical, that I like and children love. About a girl who has extra special abilities, or abnormalities, and then goes into complete isolation from the world including her family because of it. Instead of learning to cope while living her fears, she lets them overpower her. She stays hidden, in her room, until her twenties... emotionally damaging her sister along the way. After finally revealing herself to everyone, she accidentally shows her abilities/insecurities/abnormalities/powers then out of instinct they misunderstand her (of course, that will happen, it is life), and instead of explaining herself out of fear (AGAIN) she then runs away endangering her sister even more than if she were to have stayed in the first place. What if she started showing people when she was younger, and they grew to accept her and she grew to accept herself? Or even, what if her sister could have helped her through the process? Her sister loved her even more when she played with her with her powers. Her parents obviously thought they were telling her to hide it out of their best intentions, but what if they just would have been honest to the town about it before they passed away? They were rulers; the towns people would have had to accept their daughter even if they didn't want to, and it would have made it a hell of a lot easier on the girl and her poor sister. Could've avoided all of the mess, and she might have been able to control her powers better in her twenties since she would have had more experience publicly, or in general! Jeeze, Frozen.

933,5,"First of all let me say I am completely basing my impression on proper context. I am a reasonable student and fan of animation in general and many Disney, musical style, movies in particular. For example I rate 'Mulan' and 'Tangled' quite highly. Also a big fan of 'Lilo & Stitch' and 'Finding Nemo'.Anyhow it is tough to define what didn't work here. I just watched it and had high expectations from the hype so that may have set me up for a let down. I would say the biggest items are a weak dialogue and a few jarring plot items or twists that jar me out of my suspension of disbelief.Probably the biggest one is the whole Elsa flight and """"Let it Go"" montage. This was broken on a few levels.First the good. The music is a reasonably catchy, pop power ballad and the visuals are well executed. However the whole premise is what ripped me out of the mood in the first place. How in the world has a young sorceress, who has repressed her powers basically her whole life and been completely untrained, able to craft the fortress of solitude etc. on the first try? One grants fantasy lots of things but if she cannot control her power to the extent of randomly freezing things mere hours before, where does the precision come from to craft high art and animate things? Maybe if she had been secretly training with the trolls for 10 years. Also why in the world the parents though it was a good idea to closet her away instead of finding some trainer is beyond me. Sigh...Next was the almost giggling funny transformation from the regal attire to some sort of rather, well, shall we say sexy outfit. Apparently just revelling in the girl power, but it seemed strange and out of place.Another minor irritant is the somewhat tiring, and sudden, appearance of the *another* comic relief... snowman? Also why the rather diabolus ex machina of the bad prince near the end. I know it set up the sacrifice but that could have been done is a less contrived way.Well I hope I'm not coming across a demanding too much. I've got caught up in many other Disney offerings and not felt as let down; for example 'Brave' was an overall better offering in spite of that film's weaknesses.","['first', 'let', 'say', 'completely', 'base', 'impression', 'proper', 'context', 'reasonable', 'student', 'fan', 'animation', 'general', 'many', 'disney', 'musical', 'style', 'movie', 'particular', 'example', 'rate', 'mulan', 'tangle', 'quite', 'highly', 'also', 'big', 'fan', 'lilo', 'stitch', 'find', 'nemo', 'anyhow', 'tough', 'define', 'work', 'watch', 'high', 'expectation', 'hype', 'may', 'set', 'let', 'would', 'say', 'big', 'item', 'weak', 'dialogue', 'jarring', 'plot', 'item', 'twist', 'jar', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'probably', 'big', 'one', 'whole', 'elsa', 'flight', 'let', 'go', 'montage', 'broken', 'level', 'first', 'good', 'music', 'reasonably', 'catchy', 'pop', 'power', 'ballad', 'visuals', 'well', 'execute', 'however', 'whole', 'premise', 'ripped', 'mood', 'first', 'place', 'world', 'young', 'sorceress', 'repress', 'power', 'basically', 'whole', 'life', 'completely', 'untrained', 'able', 'craft', 'fortress', 'solitude', 'etc', 'first', 'try', 'one', 'grant', 'fantasy', 'lot', 'thing', 'control', 'power', 'extent', 'randomly', 'freeze', 'thing', 'mere', 'hour', 'precision', 'come', 'craft', 'high', 'art', 'animate', 'thing', 'maybe', 'secretly', 'training', 'troll', 'year', 'also', 'world', 'parent', 'though', 'good', 'idea', 'closet', 'away', 'instead', 'find', 'trainer', 'beyond', 'sigh', 'next', 'almost', 'giggle', 'funny', 'transformation', 'regal', 'attire', 'sort', 'rather', 'well', 'shall', 'say', 'sexy', 'outfit', 'apparently', 'revel', 'girl', 'power', 'seem', 'strange', 'place', 'another', 'minor', 'irritant', 'somewhat', 'tire', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'another', 'comic', 'relief', 'snowman', 'also', 'rather', 'diabolus', 'ex', 'machina', 'bad', 'prince', 'near', 'end', 'know', 'set', 'sacrifice', 'could', 'less', 'contrive', 'way', 'well', 'hope', 'come', 'across', 'demand', 'much', 'get', 'caught', 'many', 'disney', 'offering', 'felt', 'let', 'example', 'brave', 'overall', 'well', 'offering', 'spite', 'film', 'weakness']","[36, 30, 35, 291, 256, 1118, 2195, 1470, 2188, 3825, 176, 21, 623, 61, 2, 51, 355, 1, 650, 396, 694, 931, 83, 124, 472, 27, 106, 176, 3315, 2274, 71, 1411, 3691, 1771, 1206, 107, 23, 206, 452, 406, 171, 144, 30, 26, 35, 106, 3687, 434, 719, 2241, 52, 3687, 129, 1007, 2672, 210, 106, 10, 127, 4, 5019, 30, 13, 2447, 1245, 440, 36, 17, 58, 2458, 266, 658, 24, 1265, 267, 18, 1450, 110, 127, 1222, 2583, 1084, 36, 188, 126, 73, 2827, 3213, 24, 570, 127, 79, 291, 294, 1021, 2520, 1440, 430, 36, 87, 10, 1865, 545, 84, 43, 128, 24, 2397, 2327, 282, 43, 1876, 487, 5020, 40, 1021, 206, 749, 38, 43, 232, 5147, 3981, 123, 47, 27, 126, 118, 100, 17, 281, 101, 208, 71, 614, 2473, 418, 173, 1388, 85, 1772, 3028, 4561, 539, 191, 18, 3840, 35, 2590, 2855, 755, 5148, 76, 24, 75, 980, 188, 102, 670, 572, 1086, 1072, 1225, 102, 309, 297, 45, 27, 191, 1943, 2879, 65, 82, 449, 41, 56, 144, 635, 54, 321, 1535, 50, 18, 384, 40, 1168, 2736, 31, 19, 1707, 61, 2, 1611, 155, 30, 396, 335, 166, 18, 1611, 1956, 3, 2819]"
934,5,"I have always loved Disney movies, so much that I don't actually have a favorite one, I've always loved them all. I tried to find as many good things about this movie as I could for Disney's sake but I just couldn't. With that being said I feel the easiest way to review this movie is to create a Pros and Cons list because there are some things I really like about the movie and then the things I feel like they could have greatly improved on (hence the 5/10) PROS 1. The animation was absolutely gorgeous in this film. The snow sticking to the characters was amazing and that did not surprise me about Disney, they are always finding ways to make their movies more beautiful with new technology.2. The song ""Let it go"" was by far the best song in the entire movie. It might be overplayed and over said but it had an amazing message and I cant help but love Idina and they way she can make any song powerful and meaningful. 3. The cast was well picked, Kristen Bell's voice got a little annoying when she sang but she was funny and awkward and cute. Hans voice was mesmerizing which is a good skill to have when you are the villain, either way I loved listening to him whenever he talked.CONS 1. The plot to me felt unfinished, there was so much more they could have done with their movie length instead of having the characters running around in circles getting nothing done.2. The Character development was poor. From what I saw the characters had good personalities and the creators had a lot of opportunity to make these characters great. Anna was awkward and innocent, Elsa was kind and caring but very frightened, Hans was charming, handsome, but had trouble up his sleeve, Kristoff was socially awkward, and lonely but very positive and happy, and Olaf was funny but his main use was to sell merchandise, he had no development he was just supposed to make money for the movie, he had no purpose. Also I'd like to add in this section that the trolls had no purpose to the plot it didn't help move the story forward in a way I feel the trolls pushed the story back.3. The songs were not what I expected, never have I ever not liked the songs in a Disney movie. Some were tolerable and others were just annoying and painful to listen to. In all I was greatly disappointed in this movie. I always expect the best from Disney and I feel like I missed out on an amazing movie. All the content and the message and the characters were there, they just weren't brought up to their full potential. I thought Disney of all companies could make this movie happen.","['always', 'love', 'disney', 'movie', 'much', 'actually', 'favorite', 'one', 'always', 'love', 'try', 'find', 'many', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'could', 'disney', 'sake', 'say', 'feel', 'easy', 'way', 'review', 'movie', 'create', 'pro', 'con', 'list', 'thing', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'thing', 'feel', 'like', 'could', 'greatly', 'improve', 'hence', 'pro', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'snow', 'stick', 'character', 'amaze', 'surprise', 'disney', 'always', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'new', 'technology', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'far', 'best', 'song', 'entire', 'movie', 'might', 'overplayed', 'say', 'amaze', 'message', 'cant', 'help', 'love', 'idina', 'way', 'make', 'song', 'powerful', 'meaningful', 'cast', 'well', 'picked', 'kristen', 'bell', 'voice', 'get', 'little', 'annoy', 'sang', 'funny', 'awkward', 'cute', 'han', 'voice', 'mesmerize', 'good', 'skill', 'villain', 'either', 'way', 'love', 'listen', 'whenever', 'talk', 'con', 'plot', 'felt', 'unfinished', 'much', 'could', 'movie', 'length', 'instead', 'character', 'run', 'around', 'circle', 'get', 'nothing', 'character', 'development', 'poor', 'saw', 'character', 'good', 'personality', 'creator', 'lot', 'opportunity', 'make', 'character', 'great', 'anna', 'awkward', 'innocent', 'elsa', 'kind', 'care', 'frighten', 'han', 'charm', 'handsome', 'trouble', 'sleeve', 'kristoff', 'socially', 'awkward', 'lonely', 'positive', 'happy', 'olaf', 'funny', 'main', 'use', 'sell', 'merchandise', 'development', 'suppose', 'make', 'money', 'movie', 'purpose', 'also', 'like', 'add', 'section', 'troll', 'purpose', 'plot', 'help', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'way', 'feel', 'troll', 'push', 'story', 'back', 'song', 'expect', 'never', 'ever', 'like', 'song', 'disney', 'movie', 'tolerable', 'others', 'annoy', 'painful', 'listen', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'always', 'expect', 'best', 'disney', 'feel', 'like', 'miss', 'amaze', 'movie', 'content', 'message', 'character', 'brought', 'full', 'potential', 'thought', 'disney', 'company', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'happen']","[163, 6, 2, 1, 31, 103, 189, 10, 163, 6, 87, 71, 61, 17, 43, 1, 54, 2, 1105, 35, 53, 454, 50, 161, 1, 134, 1319, 2045, 550, 43, 22, 9, 1, 43, 53, 9, 54, 1316, 1864, 3194, 1319, 21, 292, 444, 3, 39, 1553, 8, 96, 445, 2, 163, 71, 50, 14, 1, 93, 108, 1379, 11, 30, 13, 142, 34, 11, 264, 1, 252, 1962, 35, 96, 185, 1961, 135, 6, 141, 50, 14, 11, 439, 1514, 227, 18, 2393, 162, 146, 86, 19, 48, 238, 1142, 85, 810, 265, 44, 86, 2695, 17, 1610, 104, 353, 50, 6, 531, 1267, 178, 2045, 52, 155, 31, 54, 1, 1465, 208, 8, 233, 200, 2154, 19, 156, 8, 356, 973, 157, 8, 17, 407, 1053, 84, 759, 14, 8, 25, 7, 810, 1315, 4, 193, 293, 1516, 44, 235, 739, 1073, 4289, 67, 2528, 810, 930, 503, 301, 32, 85, 119, 158, 718, 949, 356, 473, 14, 661, 1, 646, 27, 9, 269, 2185, 123, 646, 52, 135, 242, 12, 571, 50, 53, 123, 809, 12, 74, 11, 131, 88, 81, 9, 11, 2, 1, 1914, 247, 238, 2018, 531, 1316, 476, 1, 163, 131, 34, 2, 53, 9, 271, 96, 1, 1370, 185, 8, 599, 246, 685, 92, 2, 789, 54, 14, 1, 290]"
935,1,"According to IMDb, this forgettable title is better than Cinderella!! I have never seen an animated film that has been premeditated as much as this. I'm serious. Everything is a mess. Nothing feels natural. I get the feeling that the writers weren't capable of the level of commitment to simplicity to meet the brief. We don't need plot twists in everything today. With a simple narrative, you can really work some personality into the characters, obtain a depth of atmosphere, & release your grip on a set formula to create something truly unique.There are so many plot holes. For every good idea, there are 3 bad ones.I really love the idea of bringing back music in films. I believe Disney's best films are musicals. But the music is just forgettable & conservative. I cannot tell you how much opportunity there was for a girl who has magical powers for a huge over the top set piece! We could have had spinning icicles, singing snowmen, icebergs turned up-side down for drums etc. But ALL the songs are so.. insipid. I happen to be a producer myself, & I noticed that all the songs had a very clean adult conservative ""Studio"" sound to them. Bass guitar, orchestra, vocals. Boring. I would have created a piece with just mallets, Bells, a few synths & a Deep Bass to it. But I suppose that is TOO young, fresh, & drastic for the multi-millionaire, old timers, in their wood-floor furnished studios. Such a wasted opportunity.The main aspect of the story that really gets my moose up is the question of the protagonist. Elsa is a fascinating character at the start. The whole mystery with how she got her powers is never addressed; typically. She is the main character at this point. But then the plot comes in & ruins everything. We barely see or hear a peep out of her until the main chapter where she runs off. And we're meant to care about this? It would have been nice to see her struggle more, to see how regretful she is, & how she is tempted to see her sister, Anna. But instead, she comes off as a stroppy stolid stoic drag queen.The parents dying can be seen from a MILE off. Once again, the plot interferes with what you know you would enjoy the most. Everything is forced. Kristoff, works selling Ice! This feels as though it's meant to tie up with the powers that she has for creating ice. But it's never addressed! Elsa shuns her sister at every opportunity, runs off, & hides away ALL to ""protect her sister"" but freezes her heart at the first opportunity after not much very clunky dialog & even creates a huge massive Ice Monster which throws her off a cliff. None of which makes any kind of sense. But oh.. ha ha the snowman is funny ha ha! I loved the snowman part so I'll give this a 10/10! This is what these silly little girls must be doing.Because there is NO WAY that this awful mess is anywhere as good as Cinderella. FACT.Quote of the film: ""The Past is in the Past"" - Genius!

936,9,"Frozen's quite possibly my favourite Disney movie, rivaled only by The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's emotional, has a great storyline, fantastic characters, important lessons and is overall excellent.I like how Frozen subtly touches on issues such as child abuse. Elsa and Anna's back story may have been a bit rushed but by doing it quickly, the film prevents the little kids from realizing that Elsa and Anna are suffering from child abuse. Heck it's done so subtly that even Anna and Elsa themselves never show any indication of realizing that their parents abused them. However locking away your children for over a decade, teaching one of them to fear and perhaps even hate herself for who she is as well as separating her from the person she loves most in the world is bad parenting. And the thing is, the king and queen weren't even intentionally being abusive, which is what makes it such an ingenious part of the story. They were bad parents not because they were bad people but because they literally didn't know how to raise their daughters properly, which is why Elsa became so terrified of herself and Anna became so desperate for love that she threw herself at the first man she met. Overall the deaths of Anna and Elsa's parents was actually for the best in terms of both Elsa and Anna's character development and the overall story.Another thing it touches on very briefly is homosexuality, as implied by Oaken's family, which is something I don't think I've ever seen in a Disney movie before. Much like the child abuse it's done subtly so that many might not even notice it.And of course arguably the most important lesson in the story is that love at first sight, while it may exist (I think my parents fell in love at first sight) is not nearly as simple or wonderful as previous Disney movies make it out to be. In fact, Anna's ""love at first sight"" relationship with Hans is what nearly dooms her and Elsa. If Olaf hadn't busted Anna out of the locked room, both she and Elsa would have died. Take that anyone who says Olaf's a pointless character!Elsa is easily my favourite character in the entire film. Idina Menzel was fantastic in her portrayal of Elsa and proved herself to be an excellent singer too! Idina's voice brings a maturity to Elsa that shows a woman whose been forced to grow up far too quickly and missed out a lot of her childhood, but there are scenes where Elsa still seems very youthful, especially at the end when she finally accepts who she is and starts skating around like a child with her sister. Speaking of which, the relationship between Elsa and Anna was, and this is coming from a guy with three siblings, the most beautiful sibling bond I've ever seen. They literally loved each other more than life itself and it's both heartwarming and heartbreaking to see them to struggle to reconnect after their ruined childhood. Also I don't mind that Elsa had no love interest; in fact I think she doesn't need one because all the love she needs comes from Anna. That said, I will say that Elsa's one of the hottest Disney females in history, which is ironic considering she controls ice and snow. Normally I prefer brunettes over blonde's but Elsa's one of the few exceptions.Anna was a great character too, although I personally think that Elsa is more interesting and complex. Anna's charm comes from her being very different from the stereotypical princess. She's hyperactive, she's clumsy, she rambles but all that makes her seem like a very real person. And what makes her remarkable is that she still holds onto her optimism and innocence even after a miserable and lonely childhood. Of course she loses some of her innocence after Hans' betrayal but that's part of her character development and she learns something from it. The scene where Anna sacrifices herself for Elsa on the fjord had me in tears, even though I knew she would come back to life, because you can tell that Anna really did think she was going to die (heck arguably she DID die but was resurrected) but she would rather that than live without Elsa. Kristen Bell did a great job at portraying Anna.Olaf was a funny character and as I've mentioned before, he was actually extremely important because without him, Frozen would not have had a happy ending. Olaf also embodies the happiness and innocence Elsa and Anna had before the accident and Elsa's longing to be reunited with her sister.Kristoff and Sven were okay and their little ""conversations"" were quite amusing but overall, I wasn't too interested in them as characters. Hans' betrayal came out of nowhere but it worked because it can give people a reality check; too much trust can be dangerous. The Duke of Westleton was an okay character and I like that they didn't portray him as just a villain. He's greedy, paranoid and prejudiced against magic but unlike Hans, he's not evil. He showed genuine sadness when he thought Anna was dead.I hope the sequel is as brilliant as this movie.","['frozen', 'quite', 'possibly', 'favourite', 'disney', 'movie', 'rival', 'hunchback',

941,4,"I'm not a hater, troll, or hipster, this is just my true honest opinion, I did not like this movie. When I heard the praise and how good it was, I went to see it, expecting an amazing Disney film, like the greats from the 90's, and when the movie started, it gave me that feel. But, by the time the song ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" started I just pulled out the Disney cliché list I made in my head, and I just got it angrier and angrier at the film. Let me just say that tonal whiplash can break a movie badly, and this did in my opinion, the first 3 minutes hooked me, with it's epic music, just like the opening in ""The Prince of Egypt"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" did, but tell me something, how would you feel that immediately after ""Deliver Us"", they follow that song up with the song ""Playing with the Big Boys"", or if immediately after ""The Bells of Notre Dame"" they follow it up with ""A Guy Like You"", you will feel that the film doesn't know what tone it wants. That is exactly how I felt after the first 3 minutes I felt like they made a way different movie then the opening promised me, and it wasn't even a good kind of different film. The characters aren't memorable (bland, underdeveloped, or annoying) most of the songs are useless and annoying (there are 3 songs I can immediately tell you that could of been deleted and it wouldn't change the film, in fact it could make it better.) and adding subplots when the film should be wrapping up. It just made for a lackluster movie, and I think there are a lot smarter, intelligent, and thought provoking family movies out there. In my opinion, the second most overrated film of 2013, the first being Man of Steel.","['hater', 'troll', 'hipster', 'true', 'honest', 'opinion', 'like', 'movie', 'heard', 'praise', 'good', 'go', 'see', 'expect', 'amaze', 'disney', 'film', 'like', 'great', 'movie', 'start', 'give', 'feel', 'time', 'song', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'start', 'pull', 'disney', 'clich', 'list', 'make', 'head', 'get', 'angrier', 'angrier', 'film', 'let', 'say', 'tonal', 'whiplash', 'break', 'movie', 'badly', 'opinion', 'first', 'minute', 'hooked', 'epic', 'music', 'like', 'opening', 'prince', 'egypt', 'hunchback', 'notre', 'dame', 'tell', 'something', 'would', 'feel', 'immediately', 'deliver', 'u', 'follow', 'song', 'song', 'play', 'big', 'boy', 'immediately', 'bell', 'notre', 'dame', 'follow', 'guy', 'like', 'feel', 'film', 'know', 'tone', 'want', 'exactly', 'felt', 'first', 'minute', 'felt', 'like', 'make', 'way', 'different', 'movie', 'opening', 'promise', 'even', 'good', 'kind', 'different', 'film', 'character', 'memorable', 'bland', 'underdeveloped', 'annoy', 'song', 'useless', 'annoy', 'song', 'immediately', 'tell', 'could', 'delete', 'change', 'film', 'fact', 'could', 'make', 'well', 'add', 'subplots', 'film', 'wrap', 'make', 'lackluster', 'movie', 'think', 'lot', 'smarter', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoke', 'family', 'movie', 'opinion', 'second', 'overrate', 'film', 'first', 'man', 'steel']","[2191, 123, 62, 742, 258, 9, 1, 357, 535, 17, 13, 16, 131, 96, 2, 3, 9, 25, 1, 120, 57, 53, 20, 11, 59, 202, 45, 120, 695, 2, 274, 550, 14, 317, 19, 5155, 5155, 3, 30, 35, 340, 1, 1471, 258, 36, 211, 2503, 566, 58, 9, 631, 82, 1524, 1525, 1453, 143, 89, 26, 53, 597, 1050, 177, 378, 11, 11, 204, 106, 408, 597, 146, 1525, 1453, 378, 148, 9, 53, 3, 56, 627, 59, 522, 155, 36, 211, 155, 9, 14, 50, 140, 1, 631, 1499, 28, 17, 193, 140, 3, 8, 268, 811, 2089, 238, 11, 1490, 238, 11, 597, 143, 54, 2212, 209, 3, 201, 54, 14, 18, 269, 2213, 3, 1735, 14, 1938, 1, 37, 84, 2910, 2126, 92, 1607, 72, 1, 258, 319, 426, 3, 36, 145]"
942,7,"THIS IS MY OPINION!! This film was brilliant because it had something for everyone, it was dark, it was funny, it was graceful and the music fit the film perfectly because it was mysterious it was beautiful this film is based on the book by Hans Kristen Anderson. Our story begins with people cutting ice and singing about it but that doesn't matter we then cut to a younger Anna and Elsa were Anna wants to play we later discover that Elsa had magical and a confusing set of powers like snow blasting and ice making so they play for a bit and then Elsa hits Anna with her ice powers so the king and Queen take her to the stone trolls and they do something, so for no reason the king and queen lock Elsa in her room for 23 years or something and then Anna sings one of the catchiest songs ever about a snowman so they both grow up and now its Elsa's coronation day so the whole kingdom comes to watch and then Anna gets engaged to this guy who she's known for an hour and cut a long story short Elsa doesn't approve of the marriage and then everyone finds out about her powers and then curses the kingdom with an eternal winter so she sings about it. Anna goes looking for Elsa and then meets a guy called Kristof and he sings about having sex with his reindeer. While Anna and Kristof look for Elsa they run into a snowman called Olaf and he wants summer to come back so he sings about it so he comes with them. When they find Elsa, Anna tells her about the internal winter so they sing about it and Elsa accidentally freezes Anna's heart so Kristof takes her to the trolls and they think that there a couple so they sing about, they find out that true loves kiss can save her, so they take her back to Hans (her fiancée) but it turns out he's a doucebag so Elsa ends up saving her sister with a hug and summer has returned and they all live happily ever after. So over all it was a great film the characters were great the story was to and the music was too.","['opinion', 'film', 'brilliant', 'something', 'everyone', 'dark', 'funny', 'graceful', 'music', 'fit', 'film', 'perfectly', 'mysterious', 'beautiful', 'film', 'base', 'book', 'han', 'kristen', 'anderson', 'story', 'begin', 'people', 'cut', 'ice', 'sing', 'matter', 'cut', 'young', 'anna', 'elsa', 'anna', 'want', 'play', 'later', 'discover', 'elsa', 'magical', 'confuse', 'set', 'power', 'like', 'snow', 'blasting', 'ice', 'make', 'play', 'bit', 'elsa', 'hit', 'anna', 'ice', 'power', 'king', 'queen', 'take', 'stone', 'troll', 'something', 'reason', 'king', 'queen', 'lock', 'elsa', 'room', 'year', 'something', 'anna', 'sings', 'one', 'catchiest', 'song', 'ever', 'snowman', 'grow', 'elsa', 'coronation', 'day', 'whole', 'kingdom', 'come', 'watch', 'anna', 'get', 'engage', 'guy', 'know', 'hour', 'cut', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'elsa', 'approve', 'marriage', 'everyone', 'find', 'power', 'curse', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'sings', 'anna', 'go', 'look', 'elsa', 'meet', 'guy', 'call', 'kristof', 'sings', 'sex', 'reindeer', 'anna', 'kristof', 'look', 'elsa', 'run', 'snowman', 'call', 'olaf', 'want', 'summer', 'come', 'back', 'sings', 'come', 'find', 'elsa', 'anna', 'tell', 'internal', 'winter', 'sing', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'freeze', 'anna', 'heart', 'kristof', 'take', 'troll', 'think', 'couple', 'sing', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'save', 'take', 'back', 'han', 'fianc', 'e', 'turn', 'doucebag', 'elsa', 'end', 'save', 'sister', 'hug', 'summer', 'return', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'great', 'film', 'character', 'great', 'story', 'music']","[258, 3, 523, 89, 109, 628, 85, 2354, 58, 560, 3, 456, 2085, 93, 3, 256, 596, 44, 162, 467, 12, 160, 46, 723, 33, 63, 375, 723, 73, 7, 4, 7, 59, 204, 358, 987, 4, 170, 875, 144, 24, 9, 39, 5156, 33, 14, 204, 95, 4, 234, 7, 33, 24, 97, 49, 55, 2763, 123, 89, 180, 97, 49, 382, 4, 506, 47, 89, 7, 794, 10, 3457, 11, 81, 45, 285, 4, 343, 138, 127, 77, 40, 23, 7, 19, 619, 148, 56, 487, 723, 169, 12, 263, 4, 3372, 1057, 109, 71, 24, 405, 77, 310, 105, 794, 7, 13, 66, 4, 244, 148, 308, 1230, 794, 3697, 151, 7, 1230, 66, 4, 233, 45, 308, 32, 59, 205, 40, 74, 794, 40, 71, 4, 7, 143, 1517, 105, 63, 4, 300, 282, 7, 80, 1230, 55, 123, 37, 398, 63, 71, 62, 6, 372, 111, 55, 74, 44, 1331, 893, 113, 4, 41, 111, 15, 1236, 205, 385, 224, 795, 81, 25, 3, 8, 25, 12, 58]"
943,8,"Frozen is in my opinion, one of Disney's best ever animated features. There are many new and inspiring points that make it the amazing film that it is. The idea of ""Family is everything"" is something that the movie has perfectly represented. The storyline is also excellent and it is interesting to see how the plot diverges from the typical princess love story and romance and focuses instead on the bond of sisterhood. The two characters have been very well portrayed, especially Elsa, who is in my opinion one of Disney's best characters. The soundtrack is beautiful and it isn't surprising that the film has been nominated for golden globes best animated feature and best song awards. The twist in the end which brings prince Hans forward as an antagonist is one of the most surprising events in the tale. And contrary to some reviews that Elsa needed a love interest, I believe that Elsa is perfect as she is as she has been created as a person with an older more mature personality, someone who would put her duties and responsibilities above her own needs, someone who would in short, sacrifice everything, for her family and kingdom. And as they have included Anna with a love life, there really is no need for another. Elsa's character brings forth the idea of self acceptance and understanding, something that many youngsters face today. All in all, A beautiful Movie. I rate it 9/10 which is the highest I ever give to any movie.","['frozen', 'opinion', 'one', 'disney', 'best', 'ever', 'animate', 'feature', 'many', 'new', 'inspire', 'point', 'make', 'amaze', 'film', 'idea', 'family', 'everything', 'something', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'represent', 'storyline', 'also', 'excellent', 'interest', 'see', 'plot', 'diverges', 'typical', 'princess', 'love', 'story', 'romance', 'focus', 'instead', 'bond', 'sisterhood', 'two', 'character', 'well', 'portrayed', 'especially', 'elsa', 'opinion', 'one', 'disney', 'best', 'character', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'surprising', 'film', 'nominate', 'golden', 'globe', 'best', 'animate', 'feature', 'best', 'song', 'award', 'twist', 'end', 'brings', 'prince', 'han', 'forward', 'antagonist', 'one', 'surprising', 'event', 'tale', 'contrary', 'review', 'elsa', 'need', 'love', 'interest', 'believe', 'elsa', 'perfect', 'create', 'person', 'old', 'mature', 'personality', 'someone', 'would', 'put', 'duty', 'responsibility', 'need', 'someone', 'would', 'short', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'family', 'kingdom', 'include', 'anna', 'love', 'life', 'really', 'need', 'another', 'elsa', 'character', 'brings', 'forth', 'idea', 'self', 'acceptance', 'understand', 'something', 'many', 'youngster', 'face', 'today', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'rate', 'high', 'ever', 'give', 'movie']","[5, 258, 10, 2, 34, 81, 38, 229, 61, 108, 500, 117, 14, 96, 3, 281, 72, 132, 89, 1, 456, 1194, 295, 27, 298, 122, 16, 52, 376, 29, 6, 12, 363, 261, 208, 482, 861, 42, 8, 18, 918, 121, 4, 258, 10, 2, 34, 8, 225, 93, 1029, 3, 1463, 796, 1521, 34, 38, 229, 34, 11, 469, 129, 41, 509, 82, 44, 571, 634, 10, 1029, 618, 114, 2842, 161, 4, 99, 6, 122, 220, 4, 175, 134, 441, 64, 1022, 407, 304, 26, 196, 2857, 1175, 99, 304, 26, 263, 635, 132, 72, 77, 349, 7, 6, 79, 22, 99, 102, 4, 8, 509, 1761, 281, 429, 1946, 216, 89, 61, 2347, 381, 674, 93, 1, 694, 206, 81, 57, 1]"
944,8,"This movie was pretty good musical. Indeed, this movie reminds me of 2003's Broadway play musical Wicked on ice very much. It even has the actress, Idina Menzel from Wicked in this film, playing a similar character. Not only does it has a similar character to another musical, but the movie somewhat reminds me of other Disney princess films. It did kept with the Disney's princess movies formula, with a few changes in the end. This movie was always wanted to be made by Walt Disney as he always love Hans Christian Andersen's work. At first in the 1940's, there were going to do a bio pic of the poet with the company MGM. Disney was going to do the animated sequences of the bio-pic that feature his works such as the Snow Queen which Frozen is loosely based on. The only problem is that there is not much of a kid friendly story in Snow Queen that they could adapt to the young audiences due to its dark subject matter about complicated relationship of good and evil as experienced by a little boy and girl, Kay and Gerda at Spitsbergen. The poet had scary images of devils, hell and trolls that would scare little children. Plus, the movie had a lot of religion symbolism that a younger audience wouldn't get. It wasn't until early 2010's, a kid friendly version came around, and the 3D movie finally came alive by Director Chris Buck & writer Jennifer Lee. In this version, the movie is more about sisterhood. Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) is struggling with her ice powers, and the protagonist Anna (Kristen Bell) try to help her while Elsa is trying to protect her from herself. After a big fight about Anna wanting to marry a man, she just met, Elsa accident put her kingdom of Arendelle. Indeed, Frozen was frozen for a very long time. I have to say, when they did thawed it out, they did a good job, but the film version has little to do with the original works by Hans Christian Andersen's work. I'm glad, they didn't make the Snow Queen into the villain, but when the true villain does come up ¾ into the film, it does seem badly executed or out of the blue. Idina Menzel did great as the Snow Queen as she really does seem royal. Kristen Bell did a great job. I always love her singing voice since her work in 2005's Reefer Madness the Musical. It does sucks that not a lot of people heard her voice until now. Anna is an OK character. It's seem like her own exist, centered around being beautiful and getting a man. At less, it's show the warnings of falling in love, way too soon without understanding who you're trying to marry. The supporting cast was great. I have to find Olaf (Josh Gad) as cute. He wasn't annoying at all. I love Oaken (Chris Williams) as he reminds me so much of Peggy from the Discover Card commercials. I like Sven & Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), they remind me of Chewbecca and Han Solo from 1977's Star Wars. I adore the Norwegian mythology theme here. I like how they hint Christmas with this movie with Kristoff. He reminds me of Santa Claus because he delivers things in a sleigh pulled by a reindeer in the winter. Hans (Santino Fontana) seems kinda out of place if you think about it. I don't know, you can give temporary power to your kingdom to a foreign diplomat prince? Second off, if he really wanted to be king. Why didn't take power there? It's doesn't make any sense. The musical score was just amazing. The open music score was just epic with Sámi musician Frode Fjellheim's Eatnemen Vuelie with kulning was great. This song contains elements of the traditional Sámi singing style joik. I love the Norwegian music choir. The music was pretty good, but in my opinion, none of them really stand out due to its simplistic. Even 'Let it go' looks and sounds like any other Disney coming to age song. 'Snowman' was cute, but often cut up for small dramatic or comedy visuals. I didn't like how the movie blitzs you with song after song. It gets a little bit annoying. The animation for the film was great despite some really odd animation mistakes with the body parts going through other things or the figures not showing shadows. In some scenes, such as the bad bed hair was just amazing to see on film, while others such as Elsa singing, and her hair somehow go through her arm was badly done. I just can't believe, the animators didn't notice, that towards the end of the movie, when Kristoff is holding Anna in his arms, his thumb passes through her torso for a moment. It's pretty minor, but gees, I just wish the animators took their time retouching some scenes. The visual effects were just beautiful. The 3D really did work out with computer-generated fjords and ice. It really did seem like it was coming at you. I like how the ice is symbolism by good and bad by its color. Whenever, Elsa use the ice powers for good, it's visually blue. Then, when ever, Elsa use the ice powers for bad, its looks red like a subtle hell-like imagery. I also love the idea of foreshadowing like how Anna talks to Joan of Arc painting. Joan of Arc was condemned of sorcery like how Elsa is being witch hunt. I like how three of the supporting characters are name after the author. Frozen is PG, but in my opinion, it's pretty safe movie for G audience. I don't think snowman being their head cut off is disturbing. The movie is overall good, with minor faults, too little that nobody will really care, because the story carries the film. Frozen will thawed your heart. It's worth the watch.","['movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'musical', 'indeed', 'movie', 'reminds', 'broadway', 'play', 'musical', 'wicked', 'ice', 'much', 'even', 'actress', 'idina', 'menzel', 'wicked',

945,9,"I went to see this movie on Thanksgiving, and it was wonderful. Funny moments, emotional moments, great singing (even though there's a bit too much of it, IMO) and nice story. I was highly entertained. Though I found it a little predictable near the end, I still enjoyed it.Characters - I had no problems with any of the characters, I found none of them overdone or annoying. Olaf especially, he was funny, cute, and non-destructive to the story compared to most comical relief characters. He wasn't just thrown in there in a stupid way, and had a special connection with Anna and Elsa. He wasn't just cracking water-downed puns and jokes at random moments. Elsa and Anna have a wonderful connection in the movie, and at some parts I almost teared up :'). Admittedly, I never would have guessed that Hans would have turned out to be evil.Story - While fairly predictable, I liked it anyways. It flowed nicely and kept me at the edge of my seat. Some things we unexpected, but in a good way.Humor - I found most of the jokes and comedy actually quite funny, and I giggled during of the funny moments.Music - I found that there was a bit too much singing that could have been handled with dialogue instead, but still liked ""Let it Go"" (gives me chills whenever I hear it, but I'm not much of a fan of Demi Lovato's version).Not to mention the plot twists, I never thought Hans was going to be evil, and I did think Kristoff was going to save Anna rather than Elsa. I did think some of it was predictable, however. I knew Hans wasn't going to kiss Anna and unfreeze her heart, but I didn't know he was evil. I also knew they weren't going to just let Anna stay frozen forever. Those are just the mainly predictable points, though, and didn't effect how much I love the movie.","['go', 'see', 'movie', 'thanksgiving', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'moment', 'emotional', 'moment', 'great', 'sing', 'even', 'though', 'bit', 'much', 'imo', 'nice', 'story', 'highly', 'entertain', 'though', 'found', 'little', 'predictable', 'near', 'end', 'still', 'enjoy', 'character', 'problem', 'character', 'found', 'none', 'overdone', 'annoy', 'olaf', 'especially', 'funny', 'cute', 'non', 'destructive', 'story', 'compare', 'comical', 'relief', 'character', 'thrown', 'stupid', 'way', 'special', 'connection', 'anna', 'elsa', 'crack', 'water', 'pun', 'joke', 'random', 'moment', 'elsa', 'anna', 'wonderful', 'connection', 'movie', 'part', 'almost', 'tear', 'admittedly', 'never', 'would', 'guess', 'han', 'would', 'turn', 'evil', 'story', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'like', 'anyways', 'flow', 'nicely', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'thing', 'unexpected', 'good', 'way', 'humor', 'found', 'joke', 'comedy', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', 'giggle', 'funny', 'moment', 'music', 'found', 'bit', 'much', 'sing', 'could', 'handle', 'dialogue', 'instead', 'still', 'like', 'let', 'go', 'give', 'chill', 'whenever', 'hear', 'much', 'fan', 'demi', 'lovato', 'version', 'mention', 'plot', 'twist', 'never', 'thought', 'han', 'go', 'evil', 'think', 'kristoff', 'go', 'save', 'anna', 'rather', 'elsa', 'think', 'predictable', 'however', 'knew', 'han', 'go', 'kiss', 'anna', 'unfreeze', 'heart', 'know', 'evil', 'also', 'knew', 'go', 'let', 'anna', 'stay', 'frozen', 'forever', 'mainly', 'predictable', 'point', 'though', 'effect', 'much', 'love', 'movie']","[13, 16, 1, 2678, 215, 85, 133, 342, 133, 25, 63, 28, 100, 95, 31, 2663, 192, 12, 472, 243, 100, 231, 48, 331, 449, 41, 68, 91, 8, 198, 8, 231, 679, 5160, 238, 32, 121, 85, 265, 1085, 3984, 12, 350, 1785, 297, 8, 1121, 494, 50, 316, 1189, 7, 4, 1713, 1013, 1396, 451, 1180, 133, 4, 7, 215, 1189, 1, 94, 173, 748, 1987, 88, 26, 388, 44, 26, 113, 277, 12, 890, 331, 9, 1292, 1183, 1231, 498, 1068, 966, 43, 894, 17, 50, 222, 231, 451, 279, 103, 124, 85, 1388, 85, 133, 58, 231, 95, 31, 63, 54, 1036, 719, 208, 68, 9, 30, 13, 57, 1117, 1267, 568, 31, 176, 1381, 1382, 435, 348, 52, 129, 88, 92, 44, 13, 277, 37, 67, 13, 111, 7, 191, 4, 37, 331, 110, 488, 44, 13, 372, 7, 2015, 80, 56, 277, 27, 488, 13, 30, 7, 510, 5, 287, 934, 331, 117, 100, 278, 31, 6, 1]"
946,1,"This is one of the worst movies of the entire decade! The storyline was not well-thought out. Considering they shelved the project multiple times and only picked it up again after the success of Tangled, they should have shelved it again until they further thought out the storyline! Frozen's singers don't cut it. I don't mind pop singers like in Tangled, Princess Frog and Brave. You literally struggle to hear them over the instruments that are playing during the songs they sing. During some songs, it sounds as if the singers sometimes practically give up on singing altogether and just shout. There's a duet of the sisters in particular that I'm referring to (For The First Time in Forever (Reprise)). The animation and audio quality did not match the songs. This is most evident in the song Let It Go. The words don't match the lip movement, and the audio sounds out of place.SPOILERS: Due to Elsa's inability to properly harness her powers, she nearly kills her little sister. The king and queen take both sisters to some wise trolls who heal the little girl and then warn the parents that the powers will grow. They tell them that if she doesn't learn to control them, there will be grave consequences. The trolls then explain that fear will be her enemy. It can hinder her ability to cope with these powers. These wise and caring parents come to the brilliant conclusion that it's a good idea to completely seclude the princess from everyone. Of course it never occurred to them that this might cause her to be more fearful than ever.. They even seal off the castle. Then they leave the two fearful, confused children on their own (with no precautionary measures in place to help the cursed princess should they perish) while they go on a little cruise and drown. This absurdity continues with Elsa (the ice queen) accidentally revealing her powers in front of a foreign dignitary from a small kingdom who then orders her soldiers to arrest their own queen. I mean, do I really need to explain how stupid that is? The young princess then searches for her fleeing sister and leaves the kingdom in the charge of a young prince she has a crush on rather than a trusted aid or prime minster or any other sort of government official. After a typical Disney ""love conquers all"" moment, the curse of eternal winter (the winter was inexplicably determined to be eternal after about one night) is lifted by the ice queen who before was unable to remove it. How? They don't really explain. They merely have her exclaim, ""Of course! Love!"" That makes no sense of course because she always loved her kingdom and her sister. If love is the cure then it would have never happened in the first place. Whatever.Now my biggest complaint. The way women (and the ice queen in particular) were portrayed. There were only four women that had any prominence throughout the movie. Number one: the ice queen's mother. And it was the father who did the talking, who spent the intimate moments with both the children, etc. She might as well not have been there. There's the troll mother who embarrasses her son and generally acts like a hare-brain. Then there are the two sisters Anna the princess and Elsa the ice queen. Anna is a ditz who falls in love with- and determines to marry- a guy she's only known for a few hours. Elsa is a strong girl who's actually highly emotional and perpetually frightened like a mouse. But don't worry. She later turns against the way she was raised and determines to stop being a good girl. She then proceeds to walk down the hall like a Victoria's Secret model with a large slit in her dress deliberately placed to show as much leg as possible. Nearly all other women shown are intentionally made to be fat and unattractive. So what can we gather from this? All in all, 1/10 stars.","['one', 'bad', 'movie', 'entire', 'decade', 'storyline', 'well', 'thought', 'consider', 'shelve', 'project', 'multiple', 'time', 'picked', 'success', 'tangle', 'shelve', 'far', 'thought', 'storyline', 'frozen', 'singer', 'cut', 'mind', 'pop', 'singer', 'like', 'tangle', 'princess', 'frog', 'brave', 'literally', 'struggle', 'hear', 'instrument', 'play', 'song', 'sing', 'song', 'sound', 'singer', 'sometimes', 'practically', 'give', 'sing', 'altogether', 'shout', 'duet', 'sister', 'particular', 'refer', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'reprise', 'animation', 'audio', 'quality', 'match', 'song', 'evident', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'word', 'match', 'lip', 'movement', 'audio', 'sound', 'place', 'spoiler', 'due', 'elsa', 'inability', 'properly', 'harness', 'power', 'nearly', 'kill', 'little', 'sister', 'king', 'queen', 'take', 'sister', 'wise', 'troll', 'heal', 'little', 'girl', 'warn', 'parent', 'power', 'grow', 'tell', 'learn', 'control', 'grave', 'consequence', 'troll', 'explain', 'fear', 'enemy', 'hinder', 'ability', 'cope', 'power', 'wise', 'care', 'parent', 'come', 'brilliant', 'conclusion', 'good', 'idea', 'completely', 'seclude', 'princess', 'everyone', 'course', 'never', 'occur', 'might', 'cause', 'fearful', 'ever', 'even', 'seal', 'castle', 'leave', 'two', 'fearful', 'confuse', 'child', 'precautionary', 'measure', 'place', 'help', 'curse', 'princess', 'perish', 'go', 'little', 'cruise', 'drown', 'absurdity', 'continue', 'elsa', 'ice', 'queen', 'accidentally', 'reveal', 'power', 'front', 'foreign', 'dignitary', 'small', 'kingdom', 'order', 'soldier', 'arrest', 'queen', 'mean', 'really', 'need', 'explain', 'stupid', 'young', 'princess', 'search', 'flee', 'sister', 'leaf', 'kingdom', 'charge', 'young', 'prince', 'crush', 'rather', 'trust', 'aid', 'prime', 'minster', 'sort', 'government', 'official', 'typical', 'disney', 'love', 'conquers', 'moment', 'curse', 'eternal', 'winter', 'winter', 'inexplicably', 'determine', 'eternal', 'one', 'night', 'lift', 'ice', 'queen', 'unable', 'remove', 'really', 'explain', 'merely', 'exclaim', 'course', 'love', 'make', 'sense', 'course', 'always', 'love', 'kingdom', 'sister', 'love', 'cure', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'first', 'place', 'whatever', 'big', 'complaint', 'way', 'woman', 'ice', 'queen', 'particular', 'portrayed', 'four', 'woman', 'prominence', 'throughout', 'movie', 'number', 'one', 'ice', 'queen', 'mother', 'father', 'talk', 'spent', 'intimate', 'moment', 'child', 'etc', 'might', 'well', 'troll', 'mother', 'embarrasses', 'son', 'generally', 'act', 'like', 'hare', 'brain', 'two', 'sister', 'anna', 'princess', 'elsa', 'ice', 'queen', 'anna', 'ditz', 'fall', 'love', 'determines', 'marry', 'guy', 'know', 'hour', 'elsa', 'strong', 'girl', 'actually', 'highly', 'emotional', 'perpetually', 'frighten', 'like', 'mouse', 'worry', 'later', 'turn', 'way', 'raise', 'determines', 'stop', 'good', 'girl', 'proceeds', 'walk', 'hall', 'like', 'victoria', 'secret', 'model', 'large', 'slit', 'dress', 'deliberately', 'place', 'show', 'much', 'leg', 'possible', 'nearly', 'woman', 'show', 'intentionally', 'make', 'fat', 'unattractive', 'gather', 'star']","[10, 65, 1, 264, 492, 295, 18, 92, 421, 1999, 1020, 1418, 20, 2393, 577, 83, 1999, 142, 92, 295, 5, 706, 723, 320, 658, 706, 9, 83, 29, 659, 335, 643, 639, 568, 2891, 204, 11, 63, 11, 259, 706, 504, 1349, 57, 63, 2820, 2716, 1513, 15, 650, 2064, 36, 20, 287, 1775, 21, 2272, 283, 553, 11, 2892, 11, 30, 13, 548, 553, 2515, 886, 2272, 259, 188, 419, 404, 4, 2545, 1675, 3308, 24, 501, 286, 48, 15, 97, 49, 55, 15, 1041, 123, 1234, 48, 76, 1228, 118, 24, 285, 143, 347, 128, 2124, 1560, 123, 400, 187, 1570, 2483, 367, 1729, 24, 1041, 293, 118, 40, 523, 734, 17, 281, 291, 1815, 29, 109, 228, 88, 1932, 252, 328, 1604, 81, 28, 2768, 168, 322, 42, 1604, 875, 70, 4926, 2787, 188, 135, 405, 29, 3105, 13, 48, 2950, 4927, 3898, 647, 4, 33, 49, 300, 528, 24, 938, 1579, 2889, 601, 77, 496, 2100, 3302, 49, 218, 22, 99, 400, 494, 73, 29, 793, 1454, 15, 586, 77, 807, 73, 82, 2481, 191, 836, 3199, 2512, 4928, 539, 2598, 1812, 376, 2, 6, 2099, 133, 405, 310, 105, 105, 3726, 993, 310, 10, 773, 1848, 33, 49, 1178, 1282, 22, 400, 1300, 2705, 228, 6, 14, 217, 228, 163, 6, 77, 15, 6, 1256, 26, 88, 290, 36, 188, 653, 106, 897, 50, 251, 33, 49, 650, 918, 784, 251, 3708, 296, 1, 184, 10, 33, 49, 883, 1400, 178, 992, 3564, 133, 70, 430, 252, 18, 123, 883, 4929, 1269, 1004, 112, 9, 4930, 1242, 42, 15, 7, 29, 4, 33, 49, 7, 4931, 186, 6, 3309, 390, 148, 56, 487, 4, 167, 76, 103, 472, 342, 2915, 1516, 9, 707, 1177, 358, 113, 50, 760, 3309, 284, 17, 76, 3005, 669, 2632, 9, 4932, 508, 753, 977, 2942, 907, 3081, 188, 78, 31, 2836, 673, 501, 251, 78, 2443, 14, 3193, 4933, 4934, 249]"

At the end of the film, when the uplifting choir ballad ""Vuelie"" plays once again as the browns, greens and soft blues return to a thawed Arendelle, the colour scheme works with the score to bring a change in tone, and a happy ending. Colour is often overlooked but it is a very important element of Frozen. The animation is visually breathtaking. Attention to detail is spectacular; from the creases in the outfits, to the ripples and reflections in the water as ships dock. The snow is a delight to watch as characters tumble around, fall, throw snowballs and glide amongst the trees. It's very realistic. And of course, the Norwegian influence is evident. The overhead tilt to Aurorea Borealis at the beginning, the fjords, the rustic Medieval castle design. You'll feel as if you already have one foot in Arendelle. Frozen follows the steps of Tangled in subverting the traditional princess role. Like Rapunzel leaving her tower and taking matters into her own hands, Anna does the same in attempting to reconcile with her sister. The straight-laced, formal and polite princess is gone; Rapunzel whacking Flynn on the head with a frying pan was the start of it, and Kristin Bell manages to take it further in the character of Anna. It's a very lifelike voice performance, especially compared to the more regal and composed Elsa; she hesitates and stutters, she has momentary lapses of concentration, and she likes to stuff her face with chocolate and ice cream. There are more reversal of tropes in Frozen which give it a unique perspective. The sudden engagement of Hans and Anna is treated as ridiculous, at the end Kristoff and Anna merely start dating and don't hurriedly fall in love and get married, and most important of all, true love means not romantic love, but the love between two sisters. It's a very satisfying and unexpected route to take in an age where irrelevant of distracting romance is seemingly shoehorned into many films. Even better it's not a twist for twists sake.There is little excess in Frozen's script. The true love twist where Elsa sacrifices herself for Anna is built up from the beginning of the movie. The upbeat yet heartbreaking montage of ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"" utilises appropriately aged versions and voices of Anna and Elsa to provide a tragic back-story. You can see the struggle of Elsa as she tries to control her powers and prevent harm to her sister. There's the symbolism of the carefree and playful Olaf, a reminder of their past and the protective nature of Elsa. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez's soundtrack is magical. While Tangled starts with a pop ballad, the opening of Frozen feels much more like a musical. The synchronized movements and beats of the ice merchants feels like a dance sequence, the chanting reminiscent of the army's chants in Mulan's ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"". The excitement of Anna is musically represented in the the lively and spirited strings opening of ""For The First Time in Forever"", which manages to blend flawlessly with parts of Elsa's ""Let It Go"". The mix of the contrasting themes gradually crescendos before opening the gates and again during a later confrontation in the ice castle and is a stirring and emotive way of building tension between the sisters. Idina Menzel's rendition of ""Let It Go"" is perhaps the best performance of the film, which in 3 minutes captures the plight of Anna's struggle with her identity and powers before she finally releases all the pent up frustration, anger and fear. Josh Gad's ""In Summer"" is both charming and hilarious, as is Jonathan Groff's ""Reindeers Are Better Than People"". The only misstep is the rock troll's ""Fixer Upper"" which not only tries to force a romantic angle that is only just starting to form, but also takes place right after a potentially fatal ice strike to the heart, making it tonally inconsistent. There are flaws which prevent Frozen from reaching its full potential. The premise for the sister's separation is quite weak. It's hard to imagine Elsa staying in the one room for years on end. What's even more baffling is the parenting technique of two barely fleshed out characters who force Elsa to conceal her true self and never attempt to practice or control her powers. The mother doesn't even have a single line of dialogue! Had the parents been built up as more three-dimensional characters maybe this decision wouldn't seem so foolish. Instead they are quickly killed off and forgotten. The rock trolls exist as nothing more than poor and repetitive character design, serving no purpose other than for one wise old man to give sagely advice. Not exactly ground-breaking. At times the quirky humorous route that Olaf takes becomes sheer indulgence and unnecessary: ""I don't have a skull."" Lastly, the setting of the mountains contains no visual logic and is uneven and confusing. One moment they are along a cliff edge, then they are jumping between two cliffs, then they are thrown off one; an especially lazy moment is when Olaf stumbles upon a staircase that ""leads exactly where you want to go"". Overall, Frozen is visually stunning, immersive and captivating. Both soundtrack and score are pleasing and the voice acting is excellent. It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction and at times reminiscent of the Disney Renaissance.","['first', 'thing', 'notice', 'frozen', 'beautiful', 'animate', 'world', 'barely',

If you like a lot of Disney magic and lots of good girl role models in your animated films, this is for you. Just don't be surprised if you find Kristoff annoying.

951,7,"Let me start of by saying that I am a huge fan of Disney and musicals in general, because I have noticed that many people who criticize this film criticize it because they don't like musicals, which is unfair to the film. We will start with the good, the animation in this movie is amazing, it is better than any movie I have ever seen. Also, it did something that I did not expect, it made me laugh. Upon seeing trailers I thought that the character Olaf was going to be painfully annoying and unfunny, but it is quite the opposite,he is actually quite charming and very funny, as with most other characters. Also, this is the first Disney movie that show young girls that they don't need men to save them. I was actually groaning thinking about how cliché this movie was until the end were Anna saves her sister and herself. This movie really did take on what Disney critics had said about their treatment of women in the past, and this is something I want to see more of. Now on to the bad. The songs in this movie were not up to par with other Disney songs, they had ""Let it go"" but that is about it. ""Do you Want to Build a Snowman"" was pretty catchy, but everything else was just mediocre. A huge problem I had with this movie is not making the main character, the main character. Anna is just some girl who thinks she is lonely. Elsa is so much more interesting than her yet most of the film is centered around Anna. But there is a plot hole that I don't think anyone noticed that makes me feel like the writers just made it up as they were writing. Why does Hans save Elsa in the castle if he is just going to kill her later. He practically jumps in front of that arrow. It makes no sense, he could have just let her die.

It was still pretty good.The movie taught you a few things too.At one point, Ana just immediately falls in love with this guy, and just after one day of getting to know him, she decides to marry him.

955,9,"I came into the movie not knowing much about it. I've actually never seen a trailer for this movie beforehand so I had no predisposition about the movie. But after seeing it, I would have to say that this film is a Disney classic. The story is full of depth and not once did it feel dragging at all. The story flowed fluidly with enough attention to detail that enriched the plot-lines fully. It did not fail to bring the right emotions to each scene.One thing that stood out are the characters (which is essential to an Animation film). Character development is solid as we got to see the main casts' backstories and premise. Also, Disney provided us with good character balance. This is not a simplistic protagonist vs antagonist story, but a complicated mixture of issues and resolutions that each characters provide. There's the outgoing, carefree Anna, who's personality brings warmth to any room; there's the caring, protective, and reserved older sister Elsa, who's gift/curse has not been cared for or addressed properly; there's the cool, good-hearted Kristoff, who provides a good balance of heroism and susceptibility; there's the suave, gentlemanly Prince Hans, whose smile and persona can gain your trust; and there's the pure-hearted and kind Olaf, who never fails to say what needs to be said, balances the tension, and provides the occasional, well needed comedic relief. Each character brings something to the table, which is what made this movie beautiful.Then there's the musical score and the songs. Well delivered, and on point with each word. The vocal performances are divine. It's wonderful how different Anna and Elsa's singing voices are. Disney found the perfect vocals to represent each character. It's so easy to differentiate them from the tone of their singing voice, and their tones betray the character they portray. I believe this was what made the singing numbers so great, it's that the vocals perfectly matched the characters.All in all, this was quite a surprise. A Disney classic that will live on. A story with a purpose. Music that fits like a puzzle. Characters that will live on in our hearts.","['come', 'movie', 'know', 'much', 'actually', 'never', 'see', 'trailer', 'movie', 'beforehand', 'predisposition', 'movie', 'see', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'disney', 'classic', 'story', 'full', 'depth', 'feel', 'drag', 'story', 'flow', 'fluidly', 'enough', 'attention', 'detail', 'enrich', 'plot', 'line', 'fully', 'fail', 'bring', 'right', 'emotion', 'scene', 'one', 'thing', 'stood', 'character', 'essential', 'animation', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'solid', 'get', 'see', 'main', 'cast', 'backstories', 'premise', 'also', 'disney', 'provide', 'u', 'good', 'character', 'balance', 'simplistic', 'protagonist', 'v', 'antagonist', 'story', 'complicate', 'mixture', 'issue', 'resolution', 'character', 'provide', 'outgo', 'carefree', 'anna', 'personality', 'brings', 'warmth', 'room', 'care', 'protective', 'reserve', 'old', 'sister', 'elsa', 'gift', 'curse', 'care', 'address', 'properly', 'cool', 'good', 'hearted', 'kristoff', 'provide', 'good', 'balance', 'heroism', 'susceptibility', 'suave', 'gentlemanly', 'prince', 'han', 'whose', 'smile', 'persona', 'gain', 'trust', 'pure', 'hearted', 'kind', 'olaf', 'never', 'fails', 'say', 'need', 'say', 'balance', 'tension', 'provide', 'occasional', 'well', 'need', 'comedic', 'relief', 'character', 'brings', 'something', 'table', 'make', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'song', 'well', 'deliver', 'point', 'word', 'vocal', 'performance', 'divine', 'wonderful', 'different', 'anna', 'elsa', 'sing', 'voice', 'disney', 'found', 'perfect', 'vocal', 'represent', 'character', 'easy', 'differentiate', 'tone', 'sing', 'voice', 'tone', 'betray', 'character', 'portray', 'believe', 'make', 'sing', 'number', 'great', 'vocal', 'perfectly', 'match', 'character', 'quite', 'surprise', 'disney', 'classic', 'live', 'story', 'purpose', 'music', 'fit', 'like', 'puzzle', 'character', 'live', 'heart']","[40, 1, 56, 31, 103, 88, 16, 394, 1, 2538, 1, 16, 26, 35, 3, 2, 69, 12, 246, 609, 53, 1045, 12, 1183, 4392, 164, 541, 468, 5165, 52, 213, 822, 1166, 221, 130, 240, 90, 10, 43, 1485, 8, 1337, 21, 3, 8, 356, 664, 19, 16, 119, 227, 1222, 27, 2, 458, 177, 17, 8, 677, 1556, 354, 1330, 634, 12, 979, 1804, 519, 1098, 8, 458, 2353, 2549, 7, 407, 509, 1324, 506, 293, 2757, 1313, 64, 15, 4, 832, 405, 293, 1595, 1675, 556, 17, 1329, 67, 458, 17, 677, 5166, 82, 44, 620, 914, 2654, 1697, 836, 724, 1329, 193, 32, 88, 1052, 35, 99, 35, 677, 1214, 458, 1422, 18, 99, 1043, 297, 8, 509, 89, 1461, 14, 1, 93, 51, 223, 11, 18, 1050, 117, 548, 821, 493, 5117, 215, 140, 7, 4, 63, 86, 2, 231, 175, 821, 1194, 8, 454, 5167, 627, 63, 86, 627, 8, 1018, 220, 14, 63, 184, 25, 821, 456, 553, 8, 124, 445, 2, 69, 224, 12, 646, 58, 560, 9, 2351, 8, 224, 80]"
956,9,"Frozen is hands down one of Disney animations most beautiful and cleverly written films in a very, very long time. It's a film that will appeal to children, but adults also. The characters are great(as is the performances of their voice actors) Idina Mendzel is amazing as Elsa, a princess born with cryokinetic powers and is taught to ""conceal, don't feel"" which isolates her from everyone,most especially her sister Anna(Kristen Bell) who is as goofy and caring as Elsa is serious and graceful. Kristoff(Jonathan Groff) is the orphaned ice salesman who bonds with Anna while leading her up the mountain to retrieve Elsa after she runs away. Santino Fontana is great as Prince Hans, the too good to be true Disney prince archetype. The greatly underrated Josh Gad is Olaf, the comic relief snowman that delivers humor and heart warming messages throughout the film. The story is inspired by Hans Christen Anderson's 'The Snow Queen' but is an entirely different animal. The story centers on the relationship between sisters, to be caring and selfless. This new wave of breaking the Disney formula is fresh and overdue-The princesses are not perfection, the princes and other characters are flawed and human, the stories don't center around wispy romances, but the love of family and friends. The animation is truly something to behold. The large amounts of snow and ice the animators had to create is stunning beautiful. Each landscape is different and special. The characters are beautifully designed. The musical team of Lopez and Lopez-Anderson is the best Disney's had since Menken and Ashman. The songs are memorable and beautifully written with lyrics worthy of joining the ranks of ""A whole New World"" and ""Colors Of The Wind"". The string of 3-d animated features Disney has been producing, ""Tangled"", ""Wreck It Ralph"" and now 'Frozen' will hopefully kick off a new renaissance of Disney classics.","['frozen', 'hand', 'one', 'disney', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'cleverly', 'write', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'appeal', 'child', 'adult', 'also', 'character', 'great', 'performance', 'voice', 'actor', 'idina', 'mendzel', 'amaze', 'elsa', 'princess', 'born', 'cryokinetic', 'power', 'taught', 'conceal', 'feel', 'isolates', 'everyone', 'especially', 'sister', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'goofy', 'care', 'elsa', 'serious', 'graceful', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'orphan', 'ice', 'salesman', 'bond', 'anna', 'lead', 'mountain', 'retrieve', 'elsa', 'run', 'away', 'santino', 'fontana', 'great', 'prince', 'han', 'good', 'true', 'disney', 'prince', 'archetype', 'greatly', 'underrated', 'josh', 'gad', 'olaf', 'comic', 'relief', 'snowman', 'delivers', 'humor', 'heart', 'warm', 'message', 'throughout', 'film', 'story', 'inspire', 'han', 'christen', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'entirely', 'different', 'animal', 'story', 'center', 'relationship', 'sister', 'care', 'selfless', 'new', 'wave', 'break', 'disney', 'formula', 'fresh', 'overdue', 'princess', 'perfection', 'prince', 'character', 'flaw', 'human', 'story', 'center', 'around', 'wispy', 'romance', 'love', 'family', 'friend', 'animation', 'truly', 'something', 'behold', 'large', 'amount', 'snow', 'ice', 'animator', 'create', 'stun', 'beautiful', 'landscape', 'different', 'special', 'character', 'beautifully', 'design', 'musical', 'team', 'lopez', 'lopez', 'anderson', 'best', 'disney', 'since', 'menken', 'ashman', 'song', 'memorable', 'beautifully', 'write', 'lyric', 'worthy', 'join', 'rank', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'color', 'wind', 'string', 'animate', 'feature', 'disney', 'produce', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'frozen', 'hopefully', 'kick', 'new', 'renaissance', 'disney', 'classic']","[5, 323, 10, 2, 21, 93, 4761, 165, 3, 169, 20, 3, 484, 70, 147, 27, 8, 25, 493, 86, 518, 141, 4210, 96, 4, 29, 589, 2534, 24, 1372, 1232, 53, 2293, 109, 121, 15, 7, 162, 146, 961, 293, 4, 835, 2354, 67, 455, 377, 2291, 33, 1443, 482, 7, 248, 214, 3805, 4, 233, 101, 688, 665, 25, 82, 44, 17, 62, 2, 82, 2417, 1316, 1877, 275, 257, 32, 309, 297, 45, 1143, 222, 80, 362, 185, 296, 3, 12, 500, 44, 3204, 467, 39, 49, 1083, 140, 876, 12, 649, 153, 15, 293, 1945, 108, 2256, 340, 2, 534, 819, 3766, 29, 1642, 82, 8, 386, 515, 12, 649, 200, 363, 6, 72, 327, 21, 329, 89, 2052, 977, 624, 39, 33, 812, 134, 315, 93, 889, 140, 316, 8, 529, 424, 51, 486, 928, 928, 467, 34, 2, 98, 1919, 4759, 11, 268, 529, 165, 475, 790, 813, 1468, 127, 108, 126, 651, 848, 2505, 38, 229, 2, 587, 83, 352, 379, 5, 1309, 1699, 108, 465, 2, 69]"

958,10,"Frozen is quite possibly the best Disney movie ever. It focuses on the story of two sisters, Anna and Elsa, and their relationship with themselves and each other. Anna, who is desperate to find love, discovers that ""love at first sight"" isn't always what it appears to be. Elsa, who is desperate to be loved but feels she is unlovable, discovers that no matter how many people already do love you, none of it matters if you can't love yourself. The sisters discover that the most important thing in life is family, and everything else will fall into place.A common note of dissent among many reviewers is that Elsa did not get a prince in the end. However, I feel that this only added to the movie's message of true love and family. Anna found her prince, but her ""true love"" was still her sister. Elsa had just discovered that she WAS lovable once she could love herself, a lesson she had to learn herself with the help of her sister. Lessons of love do not always have to come from a ""prince"". She was not ready for her prince yet, which adds to the realism of the movie's moral. Yes, she may have ""deserved"" a prince, but sometimes you don't get what you deserve, and, as a wise person once said to me, ""Love is a privilege, NOT an entitlement.""I do hope she gets her prince in a (possible!) sequel.

959,9,"Word is that in its original conception ""Frozen"" was to feature a traditional Disney villain, namely the magically-empowered older of the two starring sisters. Wiser counsel prevailed, and in the movie that came into existence the sisters are given the freedom to be real. While they fill the narrative spaces that are usually occupied by hero and villain, they are not constrained by the usual limitations of those categories. The principle character, Anna (Kristen Bell), is naive and sympathetic, while the exiled Elsa (Idina Menzel) is uncommunicative and sympathetic. Disney movies have pitted two women against each other before, as in the case of Aurora and Maleficent or Ariel and Ursula, but in those cases the lines between them were black and white and the characterizations were rooted in traditional dichotomies of appearance and mannerism. In ""Frozen"" the sisters are instead cut from the same mold, and as the movie progresses they become more alike rather than less so. For most of the movie there really is no ""bad guy"" (when one is suddenly revealed towards the end it feels too convenient, more in service of plot than character), and this creative decision puts the focus on internal conflicts that are more nuanced than the external ones that usually drive Disney stories.The girls are, rather than enemies, profoundly different in their essential natures without either being held up as an ideal or a monster. They differ in a way that is gloriously open to all sorts of interpretation; I, as an introvert and an older sibling, take the story to be an illustration of introversion versus extroversion, but it may just as well be about sexual orientation or other ways in which people are what they are regardless of social pressure to the contrary. Those layers of meaning, like the revisionism of the romantic storyline (the main love interest is a typical Han Solo type, but his role in Anna's life is that of sidekick rather than savior), is something that children who grow up with the movie may consciously appreciate only when they revisit it as teenagers and young adults. They will surely find that it holds up well over the years, and they should count themselves lucky that such an intelligent and affirming film is the iconic Disney product of their generation. It is probably better and better for you—and I say this as a fan of the entire Disney canon— than ""The Little Mermaid""s of my generation or the ""Sleeping Beauty""s of generations past.Contemporary, plasticky 3D animation of which I am usually not a fan is put to use in ""Frozen"" a way that makes it almost artistically necessity instead of merely economically efficient (though the girls' eyes surely did not need to be so anime-like in scale). An early scene in which the 3D Anna poses in front of 2D oil paintings would be hard to replicate in traditional, hand-drawn animation. As for the songs, Disney films have never lacked for good ones, and at least two from ""Frozen"" (""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"" and ""Let it Go"") have already rightly become classics. The songs do a lot of the narrative work, particularly in the early set-dressing stages, and as good as they are it would have been nice if the script had devoted one or two additional spoken scenes to Elsa in her ice palace. To ask for a movie to be longer than it is is of course not a criticism but a compliment.","['word', 'original', 'conception', 'frozen', 'feature', 'traditional', 'disney', 'villain', 'namely', 'magically', 'empower', 'old', 'two', 'star', 'sister', 'wiser', 'counsel', 'prevail', 'movie', 'come', 'existence', 'sister', 'give', 'freedom', 'real', 'fill', 'narrative', 'space', 'usually', 'occupy', 'hero', 'villain', 'constrain', 'usual', 'limitation', 'category', 'principle', 'character', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'naive', 'sympathetic', 'exile', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'uncommunicative', 'sympathetic', 'disney', 'movie', 'pit', 'two', 'woman', 'case', 'aurora', 'maleficent', 'ariel', 'ursula', 'case', 'line', 'black', 'white', 'characterization', 'root', 'traditional', 'dichotomy', 'appearance', 'mannerism', 'frozen', 'sister', 'instead', 'cut', 'mold', 'movie', 'progress', 'become', 'alike', 'rather', 'less', 'movie', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'one', 'suddenly', 'reveal', 'towards', 'end', 'feel', 'convenient', 'service', 'plot', 'character', 'creative', 'decision', 'put', 'focus', 'internal', 'conflict', 'nuanced', 'external', 'one', 'usually', 'drive', 'disney', 'story', 'girl', 'rather', 'enemy', 'profoundly', 'different', 'essential', 'nature', 'without', 'either', 'held', 'ideal', 'monster', 'differ', 'way', 'gloriously', 'open', 'sort', 'interpretation', 'introvert', 'old', 'sibling', 'take', 'story', 'illustration', 'introversion', 'versus', 'extroversion', 'may', 'well', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'way', 'people', 'regardless', 'social', 'pressure', 'contrary', 'layer', 'meaning', 'like', 'revisionism', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'main', 'love', 'interest', 'typical', 'han', 'solo', 'type', 'role', 'anna', 'life', 'sidekick', 'rather', 'savior', 'something', 'child', 'grow', 'movie', 'may', 'consciously', 'appreciate', 'revisit', 'teenager', 'young', 'adult', 'surely', 'find', 'hold', 'well', 'year', 'count', 'lucky', 'intelligent', 'affirm', 'film', 'iconic', 'disney', 'product', 'generation', 'probably', 'well', 'well', 'say', 'fan', 'entire', 'disney', 'canon', 'little', 'mermaid', 'generation', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'generation', 'past', 'contemporary', 'plasticky', 'animation', 'usually', 'fan', 'put', 'use', 'frozen', 'way', 'make', 'almost', 'artistically', 'necessity', 'instead', 'merely', 'economically', 'efficient', 'though', 'girl', 'eye', 'surely', 'need', 'anime', 'like', 'scale', 'early', 'scene', 'anna', 'pose', 'front', 'oil', 'painting', 'would', 'hard', 'replicate', 'traditional', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'song', 'disney', 'film', 'never', 'lack', 'good', 'one', 'least', 'two', 'frozen', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'let', 'go', 'already', 'rightly', 'become', 'classic', 'song', 'lot', 'narrative', 'work', 'particularly', 'early', 'set', 'dress', 'stage', 'good', 'would', 'nice', 'script', 'devote', 'one', 'two', 'additional', 'spoken', 'scene', 'elsa', 'ice', 'palace', 'ask', 'movie', 'longer', 'course', 'criticism', 'compliment']","[548, 230, 2527, 5, 229, 462, 2, 104, 2378, 1663, 1852, 64, 42, 249, 15, 5059, 4589, 4548, 1, 40, 1429, 15, 57, 1701, 195, 481, 802, 1628, 460, 3010, 544, 104, 562, 2493, 1693, 2907, 8, 7, 162, 146, 1144, 1616, 1602, 4, 141, 116, 1616, 2, 1, 3873, 42, 251, 514, 3101, 1902, 1915, 5168, 514, 213, 1172, 365, 1640, 885, 462, 3901, 1225, 3043, 5, 15, 208, 723, 2308, 1, 1149, 179, 725, 191, 321, 1, 22, 65, 148, 10, 1033, 528, 538, 41, 53, 1858, 4220, 52, 8, 1014, 758, 196, 261, 1517, 552, 4219, 3796, 10, 460, 1192, 2, 12, 76, 191, 1570, 140, 1337, 1094, 137, 353, 1512, 2829, 495, 4595, 50, 318, 539, 2244, 3986, 64, 409, 55, 12, 5169, 4462, 1985, 171, 18, 2414, 5146, 50, 46, 1652, 1522, 2667, 2842, 2262, 672, 9, 393, 295, 119, 6, 122, 376, 44, 1618, 524, 371, 7, 79, 436, 191, 89, 70, 285, 1, 171, 699, 2714, 1155, 73, 147, 960, 71, 655, 18, 47, 1430, 1598, 2126, 3, 1807, 2, 1060, 616, 210, 18, 18, 35, 176, 264, 2, 1541, 48, 422, 616, 1090, 149, 616, 276, 1685, 21, 460, 176, 196, 158, 5, 50, 14, 173, 208, 1300, 3391, 100, 76, 336, 960, 99, 2599, 9, 1827, 594, 90, 7, 2799, 938, 3121, 1719, 26, 307, 2577, 462, 323, 747, 21, 11, 2, 3, 88, 273, 17, 10, 250, 42, 5, 59, 202, 45, 30, 13, 397, 2718, 179, 69, 11, 84, 802, 107, 536, 594, 144, 907, 1115, 17, 26, 192, 395, 2774, 10, 42, 3699, 1903, 90, 4, 33, 383, 581, 1, 612, 228, 1091, 2044]"
960,10,"I'm rather surprised at Disney, I have to say. They really broke out of the box and did something that wasn't made in the same old storyline for princesses and kingdoms. Instead of just a lonely princess who lives in a tower alone or a damsel in distress, they gave a simple story of two sisters. In some aspects, you could consider this similar to any family. I myself have a little brother in real life that I was rather close to when I was young. As we grew older though, we ended up growing more distant to a point that all we really ever see of each other is the occasional 'hi' and fight about where things are put in the house. He has no special powers, no amazing talent that he has to hide from the world, just the fact that we grew up.It is pretty much the same in Frozen although in the older sister's mind, she was doing it to protect her sister and the world from a power she was told to be ashamed of. In reality, she is probably more like the damsel in distress then the main character. The younger on the other hand reminds me a lot of myself (I know, strange to say as I am the older sister to my brother). She's childish and doesn't like to be alone. She grew up having to deal with being alone for her whole life after her sister shut herself away. All she wanted to do was getting out and have fun but her sister's fear was so great that it wouldn't let go. Though there is a prince in the story, he really doesn't have the same idea that you would normally see in a prince. He's not the one that is the savor of the story, but if I said more, it might be a spoiler. All I can really tell you is that it does not end how you would expect it to end, it ends with a surprise twist that ended up having me at the edge of my seat.The animation is so beautiful; the ice they created with all its wonderful textures is just astounding. I was enthralled by all the beautiful texture work and the amazing animation. I know, it's strange to hear me say something good about a show and not have any problems with the animation. Well, it's not exactly perfect but the problems that were there were so minimal that it didn't end up taking away at all from the show. I could watch the show over and over again and pick out every little detail that was wrong but really, then I would be just nit picking.For those who have ever read my reviews, you will know that I really hate musicals. Well, I guess this is sort of one exception to the rule and with that, I'm kind of happy. I still hate that they would break out in song so much but the music wasn't really that bad. The music was actually rather catchy and I couldn't help singing along slightly with the main song 'Let it Go.' It was such a catchy song and wasn't a bit out of place for the storyline they were going for. My only problem was when they would sort of break the song while they were singing, trying to add more explanation then there needed to be. It sounded odd in the song. The voices were really well done, Kristen Bell doing an awesome job as the young sister Anna while Idina Menzel did a really nice job as Elsa. Even Olaf, voiced by Josh Gad, was pretty well done making me laugh at some of his rather clueless nature.","['rather', 'surprised', 'disney', 'say', 'really', 'broke', 'box', 'something', 'make', 'old', 'storyline', 'princess', 'kingdom', 'instead', 'lonely', 'princess', 'life', 'tower', 'alone', 'damsel', 'distress', 'give', 'simple', 'story', 'two', 'sister', 'aspect', 'could', 'consider', 'similar', 'family', 'little', 'brother', 'real', 'life', 'rather', 'close', 'young', 'grow', 'old', 'though', 'end', 'grow', 'distant', 'point', 'really', 'ever', 'see', 'occasional', 'hi', 'fight', 'thing', 'put', 'house', 'special', 'power', 'amaze', 'talent', 'hide', 'world', 'fact', 'grow', 'pretty', 'much', 'frozen', 'although', 'old', 'sister', 'mind', 'protect', 'sister', 'world', 'power', 'told', 'ashamed', 'reality', 'probably', 'like', 'damsel', 'distress', 'main', 'character', 'young', 'hand', 'reminds', 'lot', 'know', 'strange', 'say', 'old', 'sister', 'brother', 'childish', 'like', 'alone', 'grow', 'deal', 'alone', 'whole', 'life', 'sister', 'shut', 'away', 'want', 'get', 'fun', 'sister', 'fear', 'great', 'let', 'go', 'though', 'prince', 'story', 'really', 'idea', 'would', 'normally', 'see', 'prince', 'one', 'savor', 'story', 'say', 'might', 'spoiler', 'really', 'tell', 'end', 'would', 'expect', 'end', 'end', 'surprise', 'twist', 'end', 'edge', 'seat', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'ice', 'create', 'wonderful', 'texture', 'astound', 'enthral', 'beautiful', 'texture', 'work', 'amaze', 'animation', 'know', 'strange', 'hear', 'say', 'something', 'good', 'show', 'problem', 'animation', 'well', 'exactly', 'perfect', 'problem', 'minimal', 'end', 'take', 'away', 'show', 'could', 'watch', 'show', 'pick', 'every', 'little', 'detail', 'wrong', 'really', 'would', 'nit', 'pick', 'ever', 'read', 'review', 'know', 'really', 'hate', 'musical', 'well', 'guess', 'sort', 'one', 'exception', 'rule', 'kind', 'happy', 'still', 'hate', 'would', 'break', 'song', 'much', 'music', 'really', 'bad', 'music', 'actually', 'rather', 'catchy', 'help', 'sing', 'along', 'slightly', 'main', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'catchy', 'song', 'bit', 'place', 'storyline', 'go', 'problem', 'would', 'sort', 'break', 'song', 'sing', 'try', 'add', 'explanation', 'need', 'sound', 'odd', 'song', 'voice', 'really', 'well', 'kristen', 'bell', 'awesome', 'job', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'idina', 'menzel', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'elsa', 'even', 'olaf', 'voiced', 'josh', 'gad', 'pretty', 'well', 'make', 'laugh', 'rather', 'clueless', 'nature']","[191, 703, 2, 35, 22, 1802, 598, 89, 14, 64, 295, 29, 77, 208, 930, 29, 79, 2496, 344, 1492, 1563, 57, 516, 12, 42, 15, 443, 54, 421, 446, 72, 48, 865, 195, 79, 191, 351, 73, 285, 64, 100, 41, 285, 2076, 117, 22, 81, 16, 1422, 2885, 816, 43, 196, 899, 316, 24, 96, 800, 676, 126, 201, 285, 136, 31, 5, 255, 64, 15, 320, 513, 15, 126, 24, 511, 2279, 940, 210, 9, 1492, 1563, 119, 8, 73, 323, 1044, 84, 56, 980, 35, 64, 15, 865, 1156, 9, 344, 285, 701, 344, 127, 79, 15, 686, 101, 59, 19, 125, 15, 187, 25, 30, 13, 100, 82, 12, 22, 281, 26, 1297, 16, 82, 10, 12, 35, 252, 419, 22, 143, 41, 26, 131, 41, 41, 445, 129, 41, 1068, 966, 21, 93, 33, 134, 215, 1148, 1847, 2189, 93, 1148, 107, 96, 21, 56, 980, 568, 35, 89, 17, 78, 198, 21, 18, 522, 175, 198, 1939, 41, 55, 101, 78, 54, 23, 78, 1293, 115, 48, 468, 280, 22, 26, 1293, 81, 547, 161, 56, 22, 333, 51, 18, 388, 539, 10, 645, 788, 193, 301, 68, 333, 26, 340, 11, 31, 58, 22, 65, 58, 103, 191, 266, 135, 63, 172, 774, 119, 11, 30, 13, 266, 11, 95, 188, 295, 13, 198, 26, 539, 340, 11, 63, 87, 269, 806, 99, 259, 1258, 11, 86, 22, 18, 162, 146, 338, 373, 73, 15, 7, 141, 116, 22, 192, 373, 4, 28, 32, 521, 275, 257, 136, 18, 14, 190, 191, 3310, 1094]"

963,1,"While many saw Frozen as an 'inspirational' movie which 'proves love is not only for boys' I just saw it as some mainstream, regular Disney film. The only part which was mildly interesting was Hans showing his evil side. What really puts me off is how people say Frozen is the first Disney princess film to show that a girl does not need a man yet Anna had to be saved by Kristoff. Moreover it's amazing how people do not recognize the old Disney movies such as Mulan where the girl actually fought in a war and did not sing a little song. Also Pocahontas and even Tiana are much better. There was too much singing and the plot was so cliché. For young girls however I guess it is rather entertaining and slightly different than the norm but all in all, seriously exaggerated.","['many', 'saw', 'frozen', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'prof', 'love', 'boy', 'saw', 'mainstream', 'regular', 'disney', 'film', 'part', 'mildly', 'interest', 'han', 'show', 'evil', 'side', 'really', 'put', 'people', 'say', 'frozen', 'first', 'disney', 'princess', 'film', 'show', 'girl', 'need', 'man', 'yet', 'anna', 'save', 'kristoff', 'moreover', 'amaze', 'people', 'recognize', 'old', 'disney', 'movie', 'mulan', 'girl', 'actually', 'fought', 'war', 'sing', 'little', 'song', 'also', 'pocahontas', 'even', 'tiana', 'much', 'well', 'much', 'sing', 'plot', 'clich', 'young', 'girl', 'however', 'guess', 'rather', 'entertain', 'slightly', 'different', 'norm', 'seriously', 'exaggerated']","[61, 157, 5, 2773, 1, 909, 6, 408, 157, 2633, 1466, 2, 3, 94, 1630, 122, 44, 78, 277, 387, 22, 196, 46, 35, 5, 36, 2, 29, 3, 78, 76, 99, 145, 182, 7, 111, 67, 2091, 96, 46, 1428, 64, 2, 1, 931, 76, 103, 1442, 63, 48, 11, 27, 1646, 28, 3301, 31, 18, 31, 63, 52, 274, 73, 76, 110, 388, 191, 243, 774, 140, 3410, 667, 2448]"
964,3,"It wasn't the worst film I have seen and there were a few good things about it.First of all, I thought the first 10 minutes of the film were brilliant, but after that, not so much.The thing that annoyed me the most was how reviewers and film companies were having a go at Pixar for their average 'Monsters University' and how it lacked originality. Yes I admit, it is one of Pixar's least-inventive, if not the least-inventive film to date. But that's one film. What about the fact that they created the first computer-animated film back in 1995, or the fact that 'Toy Story', 'A Bug's Life', 'Monsters, Inc.', 'Finding Nemo','The Incredible's', 'Ratatouille', 'Walle', 'UP' and even 'Brave' are some of the most original, inventive and amazing films (not only among animated films) of this century.Here we have another Disney film about a princess and I am sorry for those people who love it, but where is the originality? Okay, maybe the fact that one of the sisters (i don't even know her name) can shoot ice from her hand. But that's about all. I felt like I was watching their 2010 film 'Tangled', which I believe is a much better film. Why aren't Disney getting smashed for the lack of originality if they keep making films about princesses and princes? and yes I know, that's Disney's trademark, but at least offer something a bit more exciting. That is why I have always preferred Pixar over Disney, because not one of their films is similar of alike (besides the sequels) an they are always challenging themselves and offering something new and exciting. They are also able to make you care about the characters and add deep emotions into their films. (SPOILER COMING UP). When the parents died in 'Frozen', I didn't even care, due to the lack of character development and shallow emotional depth. The thing i look for when watching films is an idea that makes me think or moments that challenge my emotions (which is why I love Pixar so much) and there was none of that in 'Frozen'I disliked Frozen so much that I would even prefer Pixar's 'Cars 2' over it (which was a HUGE disappointment). A film that could be described as one of Disney's very worst. Hopefully they are able to redeem themselves. I wrote this review after seeing their film 'Big Hero 6' and I have to say I found it to be much better.Overall, I give 'Frozen' a 3/10.","['bad', 'film', 'see', 'good', 'thing', 'first', 'thought', 'first', 'minute', 'film', 'brilliant', 'much', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'reviewer', 'film', 'company', 'go', 'pixar', 'average', 'monster', 'university', 'lack', 'originality', 'yes', 'admit', 'one', 'pixar', 'least', 'inventive', 'least', 'inventive', 'film', 'date', 'one', 'film', 'fact', 'create', 'first', 'computer', 'animate', 'film', 'back', 'fact', 'toy', 'story', 'bug', 'life', 'monster', 'inc', 'find', 'nemo', 'incredible', 'ratatouille', 'walle', 'even', 'brave', 'original', 'inventive', 'amaze', 'film', 'among', 'animate', 'film', 'century', 'another', 'disney', 'film', 'princess', 'sorry', 'people', 'love', 'originality', 'okay', 'maybe', 'fact', 'one', 'sister', 'even', 'know', 'name', 'shoot', 'ice', 'hand', 'felt', 'like', 'watch', 'film', 'tangle', 'believe', 'much', 'well', 'film', 'disney', 'get', 'smash', 'lack', 'originality', 'keep', 'make', 'film', 'princess', 'prince', 'yes', 'know', 'disney', 'trademark', 'least', 'offer', 'something', 'bit', 'excite', 'always', 'prefer', 'pixar', 'disney', 'one', 'film', 'similar', 'alike', 'besides', 'sequel', 'always', 'challenge', 'offering', 'something', 'new', 'excite', 'also', 'able', 'make', 'care', 'character', 'add', 'deep', 'emotion', 'film', 'spoiler', 'come', 'parent', 'die', 'frozen', 'even', 'care', 'due', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'shallow', 'emotional', 'depth', 'thing', 'look', 'watch', 'film', 'idea', 'make', 'think', 'moment', 'challenge', 'emotion', 'love', 'pixar', 'much', 'none', 'frozen', 'disliked', 'frozen', 'much', 'would', 'even', 'prefer', 'pixar', 'car', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'film', 'could', 'described', 'one', 'disney', 'bad', 'hopefully', 'able', 'redeem', 'write', 'review', 'see', 'film', 'big', 'hero', 'say', 'found', 'much', 'well', 'overall', 'give', 'frozen']","[65, 3, 16, 17, 43, 36, 92, 36, 211, 3, 523, 31, 43, 1127, 1198, 3, 789, 13, 194, 921, 495, 1600, 273, 1378, 325, 637, 10, 194, 250, 1819, 250, 1819, 3, 927, 10, 3, 201, 134, 36, 642, 38, 3, 74, 201, 463, 12, 1995, 79, 495, 1926, 71, 1411, 549, 5170, 28, 335, 230, 1819, 96, 3, 471, 38, 3, 1248, 102, 2, 3, 29, 777, 46, 6, 1378, 420, 232, 201, 10, 15, 28, 56, 183, 1656, 33, 323, 155, 9, 23, 3, 83, 220, 31, 18, 3, 2, 19, 2160, 273, 1378, 154, 14, 3, 29, 82, 325, 56, 2, 2846, 250, 705, 89, 95, 447, 163, 957, 194, 2, 10, 3, 446, 725, 877, 561, 163, 1589, 1611, 89, 108, 447, 27, 294, 14, 293, 8, 269, 574, 240, 3, 419, 40, 118, 368, 5, 28, 293, 404, 273, 8, 356, 1664, 342, 609, 43, 66, 23, 3, 281, 14, 37, 133, 1589, 240, 6, 194, 31, 679, 5, 3318, 5, 31, 26, 28, 957, 194, 1406, 360, 1038, 3, 54, 2516, 10, 2, 65, 1309, 294, 1199, 165, 161, 16, 3, 106, 544, 35, 231, 31, 18, 166, 57, 5]"

966,4,"When I saw Frozen with my younger cousins, I didn't mind at first. The trailers were well-made and I had already witnessed the potential Disney had without Pixar in Wreck-it-Ralph. However, I came out of the theatre confused, annoyed and with sore ears.The plot was mediocre and is riddled with clichés. Let me summarise: Elsa is a young heir to the throne causes something horrible and is convinced that she is the monster. She runs away to a remote location and sings a song about letting go of her worries while everything at home becomes increasingly worse. Now where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, THE LION KING! This movie flat out rips off one of Disney's greatest movies and manages to become more successful critically and financially. H-HOW?! There is little originality in this plot, as it also borrows clichés from previous Disney princess movies. Love at first sight, a shady and unexpectedly evil character, a climax which is solved via true love, blah blah blah blah blah we've all seen it before. But by far the worst part of this movie were the songs. Oh my God, the songs. Not all of them are bad, but a few of them make me want to rip my eardrums out. 'Frozen Heart', 'In Summer' and 'Fixer Upper' were okay but forgettable. 'For the First Time in Forever' was a little annoying, but bearable. However, 'Let it Go' really got on my nerves. It wouldn't be as bad if Disney Channel didn't play it 20 times everyday (not to mention that every 5 year old girl on the planet sings it religiously). But 'Do you Want to Build a Snowman' was the worst, with every time I hear it my eardrums bleed a little bit.However, I do have some positive things to say about this movie. The animation looks great and Disney wanted to keep the art style similar to Tangled and Wreck-it-Ralph, which I think works well. While dull and clichéd personality wise, the characters had great voice actors and their voices perfectly matched their personality. Finally, Elsa's ice powers were cool and surprising for a Disney movie, but I just feel that they couldn't keep Elsa's skill set consistent and her powers weren't utilised to their full potential.If you're a 4-10 year old girl that adores the Disney princesses, then you'll probably enjoy this movie. But for everyone else, approach with caution. This movie will either bore you with it's clichéd plot or make your ears bleed with the numerous ear-grating songs. My only request for your next princess movie Disney is this: BE MORE ORIGINAL. Otherwise, this was overall a dull and boring movie with only a few redeeming factors that are few and far between.","['saw', 'frozen', 'young', 'cousin', 'mind', 'first', 'trailer', 'well', 'make', 'already', 'witness', 'potential', 'disney', 'without', 'pixar', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'however', 'come', 'theatre', 'confuse', 'annoyed', 'sore', 'ear', 'plot', 'mediocre', 'riddle', 'clich', 'let', 'summarise', 'elsa', 'young', 'heir', 'throne', 'cause', 'something', 'horrible', 'convince', 'monster', 'run', 'away', 'remote', 'location', 'sings', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'worry', 'everything', 'home', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'bad', 'heard', 'oh', 'yeah', 'lion', 'king', 'movie', 'flat', 'rip', 'one', 'disney', 'great', 'movie', 'manages', 'become', 'successful', 'critically', 'financially', 'h', 'little', 'originality', 'plot', 'also', 'borrows', 'clich', 'previous', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'shady', 'unexpectedly', 'evil', 'character', 'climax', 'solve', 'via', 'true', 'love', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'see', 'far', 'bad', 'part', 'movie', 'song', 'oh', 'god', 'song', 'bad', 'make', 'want', 'rip', 'eardrum', 'frozen', 'heart', 'summer', 'fixer', 'upper', 'okay', 'forgettable', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'little', 'annoy', 'bearable', 'however', 'let', 'go', 'really', 'get', 'nerve', 'bad', 'disney', 'channel', 'play', 'time', 'everyday', 'mention', 'every', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'planet', 'sings', 'religiously', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'bad', 'every', 'time', 'hear', 'eardrum', 'bleed', 'little', 'bit', 'however', 'positive', 'thing', 'say', 'movie', 'animation', 'look', 'great', 'disney', 'want', 'keep', 'art', 'style', 'similar', 'tangle', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'think', 'work', 'well', 'dull', 'clich', 'personality', 'wise', 'character', 'great', 'voice', 'actor', 'voice', 'perfectly', 'match', 'personality', 'finally', 'elsa', 'ice', 'power', 'cool', 'surprising', 'disney', 'movie', 'feel', 'keep', 'elsa', 'skill', 'set', 'consistent', 'power', 'utilised', 'full', 'potential', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'adores', 'disney', 'princess', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else', 'approach', 'caution', 'movie', 'either', 'bore', 'clich', 'plot', 'make', 'ear', 'bleed', 'numerous', 'ear', 'grate', 'song', 'request', 'next', 'princess', 'movie', 'disney', 'original', 'otherwise', 'overall', 'dull', 'boring', 'movie', 'redeem', 'factor', 'far']","[157, 5, 73, 2058, 320, 36, 394, 18, 14, 397, 1801, 685, 2, 137, 194, 352, 379, 110, 40, 1275, 875, 1127, 4882, 939, 52, 752, 3106, 274, 30, 4, 73, 1647, 952, 328, 89, 896, 1444, 495, 233, 101, 2983, 2276, 794, 11, 30, 13, 1177, 132, 533, 380, 2859, 65, 357, 425, 830, 152, 97, 1, 838, 1580, 10, 2, 25, 1, 825, 179, 814, 3821, 3820, 2051, 48, 1378, 52, 27, 3678, 274, 763, 2, 29, 1, 6, 36, 675, 5096, 3159, 277, 8, 792, 1684, 3037, 62, 6, 953, 953, 953, 953, 953, 16, 142, 65, 94, 1, 11, 425, 1006, 11, 65, 14, 59, 1580, 5171, 5, 80, 205, 772, 737, 420, 660, 36, 20, 287, 48, 238, 4225, 110, 30, 13, 22, 19, 2432, 65, 2, 2613, 204, 20, 2021, 348, 115, 47, 64, 76, 2237, 794, 59, 202, 45, 65, 115, 20, 568, 5171, 3483, 48, 95, 110, 503, 43, 35, 1, 21, 66, 25, 2, 59, 154, 749, 355, 446, 83, 352, 379, 37, 107, 18, 1026, 274, 407, 1041, 8, 25, 86, 518, 86, 456, 553, 407, 241, 4, 33, 24, 556, 1029, 2, 1, 53, 154, 4, 1610, 144, 2169, 24, 246, 685, 47, 64, 76, 3615, 2, 29, 210, 91, 1, 109, 270, 1111, 3287, 1, 353, 604, 274, 52, 14, 939, 3483, 1874, 939, 2153, 11, 418, 29, 1, 2, 230, 827, 166, 1026, 370, 1, 1199, 945, 142]"
967,-,"My 'almost' 4-yo-old grandson was visiting when this movie came out on DVD & Blu-Ray, and his mom told us this was his favorite movie, they had already seen it 4 times in the theater. So I bought the combo pack, DVD plus Blu-Ray for all of $20. We sent the DVD home with him, and kept the Blu-Ray for ourselves. Just a side note, as cheap as BD players are now, well under $100, anyone who really enjoys movies at home should get one, the picture and sound are so much better. As good as DVD is, I thought I'd never say that, but it is true.This movie is based on the old Snow Queen story but with some changes for modern audiences. It won the Oscar for best animated movie. The two young sisters lose their parents, King and Queen of this mythical kingdom, and when they finally grow up to young adulthood, the older of the two is to become Queen. But she has a power from birth, the ability to cause a freeze, or even thrown ice bolts, which immediately causes issues. To save her people she runs away, but leaving the small kingdom in a bad way, they need to be defrosted. So the younger, wanting desperately to accomplish something, throws all caution to the wind to find her sister and save the kingdom. She finds that only true love will be able to save the kingdom. Ultimately she finds that in the bond between the two sisters.The voice acting, with the occasional song, is excellent across the board. Kristen Bell is the younger sister, Anna, and she displays a really nice singing voice. Not too surprising since she grew up doing musical theater. Idina Menzel, who is even more experienced in musical theater is the older sister, Elsa. Jonathan Groff is Kristoff, the ice salesman with the sled and the moose. But to me the best was Josh Gad as the little snowman Olaf. As we have seen in other animated movies, like 'Despicable Me' with the Minions, the addition of a cute, interesting minor character can make the whole movie more fun. Gad (who had a short turn as the President's son in a TV series) has such a variety of vocal inflections and even a stellar singing voice simply makes the little snowman the most fun character in the whole movie. Overall a very nice movie, even for adults, and the picture and sound on the Blu-Ray are super.","['almost', 'yo', 'old', 'grandson', 'visit', 'movie', 'come', 'dvd', 'blu', 'ray', 'mom', 'told', 'u', 'favorite', 'movie', 'already', 'see', 'time', 'theater', 'bought', 'combo', 'pack', 'dvd', 'plus', 'blu', 'ray', 'sent', 'dvd', 'home', 'kept', 'blu', 'ray', 'side', 'note', 'cheap', 'bd', 'player', 'well', 'anyone', 'really', 'enjoys', 'movie', 'home', 'get', 'one', 'picture', 'sound', 'much', 'well', 'good', 'dvd', 'thought', 'never', 'say', 'true', 'movie', 'base', 'old', 'snow', 'queen', 'story', 'change', 'modern', 'audience', 'oscar', 'best', 'animate', 'movie', 'two', 'young', 'sister', 'lose', 'parent', 'king', 'queen', 'mythical', 'kingdom', 'finally', 'grow', 'young', 'adulthood', 'old', 'two', 'become', 'queen', 'power', 'birth', 'ability', 'cause', 'freeze', 'even', 'thrown', 'ice', 'bolt', 'immediately', 'cause', 'issue', 'save', 'people', 'run', 'away', 'leave', 'small', 'kingdom', 'bad', 'way', 'need', 'defrost', 'young', 'want', 'desperately', 'accomplish', 'something', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'find', 'sister', 'save', 'kingdom', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'able', 'save', 'kingdom', 'ultimately', 'find', 'bond', 'two', 'sister', 'voice', 'act', 'occasional', 'song', 'excellent', 'across', 'board', 'kristen', 'bell', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'display', 'really', 'nice', 'sing', 'voice', 'surprising', 'since', 'grow', 'musical', 'theater', 'idina', 'menzel', 'even', 'experienced', 'musical', 'theater', 'old', 'sister', 'elsa', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'kristoff', 'ice', 'salesman', 'sled', 'moose', 'best', 'josh', 'gad', 'little', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'see', 'animate', 'movie', 'like', 'despicable', 'minion', 'addition', 'cute', 'interest', 'minor', 'character', 'make', 'whole', 'movie', 'fun', 'gad', 'short', 'turn', 'president', 'son', 'tv', 'series', 'variety', 'vocal', 'inflection', 'even', 'stellar', 'sing', 'voice', 'simply', 'make', 'little', 'snowman', 'fun', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'overall', 'nice', 'movie', 'even', 'adult', 'picture', 'sound', 'blu', 'ray', 'super']","[173, 2576, 64, 1341, 1, 40, 540, 1081, 1030, 1109, 511, 177, 189, 1, 397, 16, 20, 312, 1863, 4228, 2161, 540, 569, 1081, 1030, 1606, 540, 533, 498, 1081, 1030, 387, 625, 2886, 3758, 18, 299, 22, 3925, 1, 533, 19, 10, 438, 259, 31, 18, 17, 540, 92, 88, 35, 62, 1, 256, 64, 39, 49, 12, 209, 324, 159, 302, 34, 38, 1, 42, 73, 15, 489, 118, 97, 49, 4693, 77, 241, 285, 73, 3018, 64, 42, 179, 49, 24, 2546, 367, 328, 282, 28, 1121, 33, 1951, 597, 328, 519, 111, 46, 233, 101, 322, 601, 77, 65, 50, 99, 3887, 73, 59, 2601, 2883, 89, 744, 3287, 848, 71, 15, 111, 77, 71, 62, 6, 294, 111, 77, 941, 71, 482, 42, 15, 86, 112, 1422, 11, 298, 1168, 2698, 162, 146, 73, 15, 7, 1151, 22, 192, 63, 86, 1029, 98, 285, 51, 312, 141, 116, 28, 1451, 51, 312, 64, 15, 4, 455, 377, 67, 33, 1443, 2398, 1503, 34, 275, 257, 48, 45, 32, 16, 38, 1, 9, 1158, 2781, 1000, 265, 122, 670, 8, 14, 127, 1, 125, 257, 263, 113, 3077, 1269, 1059, 791, 1519, 821, 4637, 28, 2207, 63, 86, 341, 14, 48, 45, 125, 8, 127, 1, 166, 192, 1, 28, 147, 438, 259, 1081, 1030, 998]"

970,4,"This film could honestly be the worst animated film I've seen in a long time. The story is predictable, it's full of convenient timing and annoying characters, the songs are mediocre, at best and everyone loves it like it's the Disney equivalent of the Godfather!Take for example the scene where Elsa is about to be killed by Hans. How lucky is it that Kristoff, the large healthy man is not faster than a weak, freezing to death Anna? How lucky is it that Anna turns into ice right before the sword hits her? How lucky is it that the sword didn't break the ice? Does nobody else see how convenient everything is?The song Let it Go has no meaning and the only reason people like it is because it is catchy. The only song that I would even consider listening to again is Coronation Day or whatever it's calledSven and Olaf are awful comic relief. Olaf isn't like the loud and obnoxious characters we've been getting in other films. He's more like a fly when you're trying to get asleep. It's quiet for most of the time, but when it makes a noise, you want to murder it. Sven is like all animals in animated films now, he acts like a dog. I hated it in Toy Story 3, I hated it in Tangled and I hated it in How to Train Your Dragon 2. If you really want to have a cute dog so all the six years olds will buy toys of it, then just have a dog! Hans is obviously the villain as soon as he is introduced because he is too nice. It would have been a better twist if he stayed nice, proving Elsa was wrong for getting mad. Also on that matter, when Anna and Hans want Elsa's blessing for their marriage. It's their choice! So what if Elsa doesn't want them getting married, they were just doing it to be nice to Elsa! Or is Elsa planning on making Arendelle a dystopian kingdom like 1984, where everyone has to consult her on what decisions they want to make in life?Talking about Elsa, she would be a terrible Queen! One day after the gates have opened, she's already ran off in fear. She shows no signs of being smart either. ""OMG love controls my powers"" One of the first things anyone with a brain would do upon getting powers, is testing with different emotionsThe ending annoyed me as well, oh look we're all ice skating! What if nobody else wants to go ice skating? What if everyone else thinks that it is super cheesy?The main theme of this film is girl power, which would have worked say pre-1980 when women actually had less rights than men. But 2013? When everyone on the world has equal rights?Going back to my original point about conveniences in the plot, the whole ""Erase magic from her memory"" is stupid as. Maybe if it was a side-effect, but all it does is straight up tell the audience that Anna is going to freak out later in the movieThis film is awful and I am actually worried about the film industry, if this garnered near universal acclaim. The reason why it got such a high level of praise? Because it's Disney? Disney gets away with anything now just like Pixar!

971,9,"I am reviewing the movie Frozen. The movie not only captured the hearts of young children, it is a world wide family favorite Disney movie. Chirs Buck and Jennifer Lee, the producers, created such a dynamic storyline, yet the movie entertained children, youth, and grown ups. A Disney movie that focuses on two sisters rather than finding love is the reason for the positive ratings. The characters Anna and Elsa came to life on the screen, and the characters were humanly relatable to children and adults. As I watched this film, I found myself throughly enjoying every scene and song. Spoiler Alert! I am so sorry for the next two paragraphs! I can not explain how great this movie is without letting the plot being known! First of all, I loved the songs and the music in this movie. The songs are very catchy. I love every instrument that was played for each song. The song lyrics also were very cute too. The composer, writers, and producers did a perfect job of creating a Disney masterpiece while adding more realistic scenes throughout the movie. Usually Disney movies focus on love between a girl and a boy, but Frozen takes a different approach. The love story is between Anna and Elsa. Their relationship was damaged when they were kids, but this movie is all about the healing process, forgiving one another, and loving one another. Another aspect that the producers put in this movie is the characters Olaf and Sven. By adding these two characters created the humor in the movie. Olaf the snowman made me laugh every time he had a line in the movie. Sven ,the reindeer, did not have any lines in the movie, but Sven had dog like tendencies. His actions made me laugh so hard. Of course there was an antagonist, Hans. That character was perfect with every line he spoke and every song he sang. He was a true Disney villain, and better yet, he was not the excepted villain in the movie Frozen, Elsa was. The movie made me feel every emotion, and I never thought that would happen in a Disney movie. Bravo Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. One of the biggest shocks in the movie was the producers kind of mocked all of the previous Disney movies. Yes, the first man Anna meets she falls in love with, but they do not end up being together at the end. I think that was a point they were trying to make. When it comes to Disney princess's movies, the main character, which is usually some kind of princess, falls in love with the first person they meet, which is typically a prince. Frozen also mocked the ""true loves kiss breaks the spell"" idea. Previous Disney movies only had one way to resolve the conflict. The problem solver is the prince kissing the princess, and they live happily ever after. Well Hans is the prince, and Anna is the princess. Everyone thought they were going to live happily ever after, but Frozen shocks the viewers. Hans is straight up mean to Anna. It is very realistic in terms of how certain guys treat girls in this world. I love how the characters were very detailed when it came to the animations. Chrisoff is the one I want to focus on now. In past Disney princess's movies, the princes are very attractive. They either have very muscular bodies and/ or attractive faces. Chrisoff has neither of those, but that is the point the producers were trying to make. It is not all about looks. You love someone depending on how they treat you, and Chrisoff does treat Anna right through out the movie.This paragraph will have some spoilers too. As the movie started and ended, it was a very original Disney movie. The plot line was very predictable. Elsa and Anna's parents died, Elsa and Anna's relationship is non-existence, and Anna falls in love with a man she just met. Of course the man she falls in love with is the bad guy, but Anna does not know that. Anna meets another guy Chrisoff and falls in love him at the end of the movie. Of course while the movie is going on, Anna is completely unaware of her feelings toward Chrisoff even though he is everything she could ever want. While all of this is happening, everyone is singing and dancing. Another part that is annoying is Elsa. She runs away scared, and she is so stubborn. The whole movie I wanted Elsa to seriously let it all go and stop acting like a child. She knew her town was in trouble because of her yet she stayed up in her ice castle, continued to have a meltdown, and not fix the problem she created. Some would hate this movie, and absolutely despise it. I totally get that. My main point in giving this movie such a high rating is that the focus shifts from boy and girl love to sister love, and it is evident that the writers, producers, and actors really tried to make this film close to perfect. Family is important, and a Disney princess movie never has had this kind of focus before. This is what makes Frozen one of a kind. The climax ends with Elsa finally letting go and loving Anna back. This scene was so touching. Anna never stopped loving her sister despite being pushed away constantly, and then finally Elsa gives her that love back. That is deep and powerful in my opinion coming from a Disney movie.In conclusion, Frozen is a must watch. This movie deserves award after award. The music, the lines, the actors and actresses, and the meaning behind the movie made this movie perfect. When I was little, I loved Disney movies, and this movie has continued that love. Frozen can thaw any cold heart out there if given the chance to watch.","['review', 'movie', 'frozen', 'movie', 'capture', 'heart', 'young', 'child', 'world', 'wide', 'family', 'favorite', 'disney',

972,4,"I really wanted to like this film but after the disappointment of Tangled, I didn't have high hopes. 1. The plot was messy, I get the idea of creating a different kind of love - sister instead of romantic. However, they still chucked two love interests in for the sake of it. Both of the male characters were completely uninteresting and to say it straight - boring. 2. Unexplained aspects, how did Elsa get her powers?, who would let two children stay alone in a castle? Many sloppy plot holes 3. I didn't get attached to any of the characters, to be honest I hated Elsa and Anna was just annoying. I didn't care what happened to them and I wasn't rooting for them to do well. I didn't feel as if they were even likable. 4. The computer animation bothered me, they looked faker and just took Tangled and changed hair colour, they looked like dolls, in an attempt(in my opinion) to make them prettier with the huge eyes. 5. Many things did nothing to the plot, many characters were added that added nothing. 6. I also tried to like the songs because I am a massive lover of older ones but these were just so pop and unbearable. Repeating lyrics, which were meaningless and did nothing to anything.Get your act together Disney, this was a generous 4.","['really', 'want', 'like', 'film', 'disappointment', 'tangle', 'high', 'hope', 'plot', 'messy', 'get', 'idea', 'create', 'different', 'kind', 'love', 'sister', 'instead', 'romantic', 'however', 'still', 'chucked', 'two', 'love', 'interest', 'sake', 'male', 'character', 'completely', 'uninteresting', 'say', 'straight', 'boring', 'unexplained', 'aspect', 'elsa', 'get', 'power', 'would', 'let', 'two', 'child', 'stay', 'alone', 'castle', 'many', 'sloppy', 'plot', 'hole', 'get', 'attach', 'character', 'honest', 'hat', 'elsa', 'anna', 'annoy', 'care', 'happen', 'root', 'well', 'feel', 'even', 'likable', 'computer', 'animation', 'bother', 'look', 'faker', 'take', 'tangle', 'change', 'hair', 'colour', 'look', 'like', 'doll', 'attempt', 'opinion', 'make', 'prettier', 'huge', 'eye', 'many', 'thing', 'nothing', 'plot', 'many', 'character', 'add', 'add', 'nothing', 'also', 'try', 'like', 'song', 'massive', 'lover', 'old', 'one', 'pop', 'unbearable', 'repeat', 'lyric', 'meaningless', 'nothing', 'anything', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'disney', 'generous']","[22, 59, 9, 3, 1038, 83, 206, 384, 52, 2400, 19, 281, 134, 140, 193, 6, 15, 208, 393, 110, 68, 42, 6, 122, 1105, 431, 8, 291, 2730, 35, 984, 370, 1401, 443, 4, 19, 24, 26, 30, 42, 70, 510, 344, 168, 61, 2111, 52, 697, 19, 1764, 8, 742, 606, 4, 7, 238, 293, 290, 885, 18, 53, 28, 402, 642, 21, 864, 66, 55, 83, 209, 844, 1452, 66, 9, 1287, 448, 258, 14, 3764, 360, 336, 61, 43, 156, 52, 61, 8, 269, 269, 156, 27, 87, 9, 11, 1219, 1350, 64, 10, 658, 3238, 1431, 475, 2618, 156, 212, 19, 112, 332, 2, 5033]"

And I especially love how they made the Act of True Love; sacrificing your life for a sister you never saw for 13 years and didn't understand why she shut you out until after those years is really something. I mean, Elsa most likely was almost a stranger to Anna. And people don't have feelings for those they don't know (otherwise go to a store, look at someone and ask yourself what you feel about that person). Her sisterly love for Elsa is one of things that make Anna so special.

974,6,"I belong to the minority that doesn't believe Frozen is a masterpiece. I don't hate it, I just find it extremely overrated, and given more credit than it deserves. It is supposed to be ""feminist"", but it's not.1. The villain. Hans, a prince so far down in the line of succession he made a plan to marry a princess and then rule through her. A very good plan, actually, but why go after the spare and not the heir? Why didn't he leave immediately after he saw Elsa was no interested in him and find a female heir that was, which would have been way easier than seducing the spare (Anna) and then plan to have the queen removed? Also, he hopes to take full of control of the kingdom after he lets Anna die... how? He's completely unrelated, and his status as prince can't give him the throne. He isn't even the heir's consort - he never married Anna (he should have waited until he married her), and a scenario where he lies about marrying Anna, with no witnesses and no consummation seems a very unlikely one to be believed. And his revelation as the villain was a cheap move for shock value, as well. There was no building-up to the reveal, no foreshadowing, nothing. It appears as if the third act was rewritten in the last minute, with not much thought thrown in it. Disney has given us some wonderfully abusive villains, but Hans was a superficial and lacking one.2. The pacing. Two many plot lines. Elsa wants to protect everyone from her, Elsa wants to control her powers, Anna wants to find Elsa, Anna wants to reconcile with Elsa, Kristoff must learn to love people as well, not just reindeer, the weasel duke wants to take over Arendelle (with a very obscure and puzzling plan), Hans wants to take over Arendelle... too many (unresolved) plot lines. A book can have many plots running at the same time, so does a TV series, but a movie? Not that easy. In the end, everything feels rushed, and no story-line was explored enough, not even the important ones. The songs are another example of bad pacing as well.3. The protagonist and her sister Anna is not a feminist character. First off, what does Anna do that's so feminist? She sets off on an adventure where she's saved by men, one way or another. Hadn't it been for Kristoff, she would have never made it out. And despite Elsa's ""You cannot marry a man you've just met"", Anna does the very same thing by the end of the movie, a movie that's supposed to criticize that behaviour found in the earlier films. So why does Frozen endorse something when they made fun of it earlier? Anna is no good character either. Namely, she has no character development. She starts off as an over-excited lady, and ends up as an over-excited lady. Her morals aren't tested, she doesn't go through some existence-doubting quest or anything, she remains the same. No conflict in there. Elsa should have been the main character. A princess whose own self is her burden, who wants to protect everyone she loves not from an eternal factor but from within, from herself, who needs to control her powers but can't, who isolates herself out of fear... a perfectly written character. Instead, they gave her a song and shoved her to the background, in an icy castle, and showed us her wacky sister's snow adventures, which include Anna getting saved by a man, being helped by a man, being led by a man, all the time. And in the end, the only choice Anna makes is to get in Hans' sword's way, which is very sweet, but comes too late. Anna is a sweet, one-dimensional character that does nothing but being stupid.4. Fictional kingdom vs realism I am no expert on such subject, but the ruling of Arendelle is treats as no big deal in this movie. The queen and king died when Elsa was 18, so why wasn't she made queen right away? Why did it take three years before she was crowned? Who ruled Arendelle this whole time? Also keep in mind, Arendelle needed heirs. If Elsa was out of question, then the king and queen should find a match for Anna as soon as possible. Instead, they shut her in. And then, Anna just abandons the kingdom, leaving Hans, a man she does not know, in charge. OK, Anna is naive, but why should anyone accept that? I imagine there must be a head in the castle's household (that Kai guy for example) who would question Hans' fitness to rule. And again, a female character is dependant on a male one, which makes me wonder again, ""Why is this movie considered feminist when women rely on men to help them and save them all the time?"" You'll notice it's never the other way round. Also, Hans attempts to slay the queen and lies about the princess' status, and gets away with that? Surely, he gets a punishment from his bros... to clean the stables. Usurping a kingdom, and attempting to slay its rightful ruler (and the rightful heir) should have him executed, if I were writing the script. And because sometimes I tend to expect the worst from anyone, if I were Elsa, I'd be wondering whether this wasn't an attempt of the King of Southern Isles to usurp my kingdom through his son, but perhaps that's far-fetched.At the end of the day, I don't think Frozen is as great as everyone wants it to be. It's amusing, it's fun, but not complex at all, with shallow characters, unnecessarily long musical numbers, and too many subplots to find out what the real story is, and explore it.","['belong',

975,6,"I found this movie to be flat. I sat there at the end, asking myself, ""this the supposed 'greatest movie Disney's ever made?' Because I don't get it."" I wholeheartedly do not agree it's anywhere near the top of the pile. Maybe above Cars? It made tons of money, but being successful and being critically-acclaimed are two completely different things. Almost all Disney movies, starting with Snow White, have been able to appeal to both children and adults alike. This movie looks like it would, too, but it's not. It's for kids, girls, to be specific. It's not even a good representation of Anderson's, ""Snow Queen."" It comes close to disrespecting it. The opening is the best part of the movie, when Elsa and Anna are playing. It's mostly downhill from there. The villains are one-dimensional, they aren't even scary villains, except for Hans, for like, a second. The animation is not great. That was the biggest disappointment of it all for me. The ""heroines"" were, well, strange looking. I got the feeling they created characters that would be easy to make into dolls, and as we know, that's where the REAL money is. They could've done INCREDIBLE animation with turning things into ice. I was not impressed. I also wasn't impressed with the music, the only song I felt was Disney-worthy was, ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman."" I'm not a fan of ""Let It Go,"" only the chorus is really worth it, the rest of the song is, well, boring. The other songs were 100% unnecessary and muddied the story line. Way, way too much music. I don't know why they chose Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel to do the speaking voices. Bell's ""always sarcastic"" way of speaking was inappropriate for Anna, but her singing voice was sweet, (although I heard Veronica Mars or Gossip Girl as Anna when she spoke). She does too many important voice-overs to be believable as a different character without changing her voice.And—Menzel is not a voice actor! She just ISN'T. Flat, flat, flat. And she mumbles, always, on stage and now, here. Had a hard time understanding her. (ENUNCIATE, IDINA. You're not only a singer!) I would've preferred really good voice actors to those two (like the children they used for young Anna and Elsa). I also have a problem with using a different singer for ""Let It Go"" for the credits! What?!? I have to say, I think Demi Lovato should have been Elsa from the get go, no clue why they didn't use her, and you could've used Ariel Winter as Anna, two Disney veterans. Just bad, bad casting for these important female leads in this movie. They could've made it contemporary, but they chose to use 40-somethings to play teenagers. Yes, they kind of sound like little girls, but here, I think, they were wrong for the parts.There were some light and funny moments in the movie and all of them were from Sven, Kristoff and Olaf. Sven and Kristoff were good characters, Sven had most of the laughs in the movie, he was also very endearing, and for me, the highlight of the movie. Olaf was okay, he was cute and sweet, very much for the toddlers. The script was mediocre, the dialogue, atrocious. Too many colloquialisms, slang, quips/insults. I was shocked. They could've fleshed the story out a bit more, it glossed over many things. They did NOTHING for Elsa's character, again, a one-dimensional character in the lead position, whereas Sven had more depth.In closing, I gave it a 6 because it's worth seeing, if merely as a dividing line between great movies like Finding Dory, Inside Out and Toy Story 3, and Frozen. Maybe Disney and their ""princesses"" are just passé. Maybe, Disney, without Pixar, is, as well.","['found', 'movie', 'flat', 'sat', 'end', 'ask', 'suppose', 'great', 'movie', 'disney', 'ever', 'make', 'get', 'wholeheartedly', 'agree', 'anywhere', 'near', 'top', 'pile', 'maybe', 'car', 'make', 'ton', 'money', 'successful', 'critically', 'acclaim', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'thing', 'almost', 'disney', 'movie', 'start', 'snow', 'white', 'able', 'appeal', 'child', 'adult', 'alike', 'movie', 'look', 'like', 'would', 'kid', 'girl', 'specific', 'even', 'good', 'representation', 'anderson', 'snow', 'queen', 'come', 'close', 'disrespect', 'opening', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'elsa', 'anna', 'play', 'mostly', 'downhill', 'villain', 'one', 'dimensional', 'even', 'scary', 'villain', 'except', 'han', 'like', 'second', 'animation', 'great', 'big', 'disappointment', 'heroine', 'well', 'strange', 'look', 'get', 'feel', 'create', 'character', 'would', 'easy', 'make', 'doll', 'know', 'real', 'money', 'could', 'incredible', 'animation', 'turn', 'thing', 'ice', 'impressed', 'also', 'impressed', 'music', 'song', 'felt', 'disney', 'worthy', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'fan', 'let', 'go', 'chorus', 'really', 'worth', 'rest', 'song', 'well', 'boring', 'song', 'unnecessary', 'muddy', 'story', 'line', 'way', 'way', 'much', 'music', 'know', 'chose', 'kristen', 'bell', 'idina', 'menzel', 'speak', 'voice', 'bell', 'always', 'sarcastic', 'way', 'speak', 'inappropriate', 'anna', 'sing', 'voice', 'sweet', 'although', 'heard', 'veronica', 'mar', 'gossip', 'girl', 'anna', 'spoke', 'many', 'important', 'voice', 'believable', 'different', 'character', 'without', 'change', 'voice', 'menzel', 'voice', 'actor', 'flat', 'flat', 'flat', 'mumble', 'always', 'stage', 'hard', 'time', 'understand', 'enunciate', 'idina', 'singer', 'would', 'prefer', 'really', 'good', 'voice', 'actor', 'two', 'like', 'child', 'use', 'young', 'anna', 'elsa', 'also', 'problem', 'use', 'different', 'singer', 'let', 'go', 'credit', 'say', 'think', 'demi', 'lovato', 'elsa', 'get', 'go', 'clue', 'use', 'could', 'use', 'ariel', 'winter', 'anna', 'two', 'disney', 'veteran', 'bad', 'bad', 'cast', 'important', 'female', 'lead', 'movie', 'could', 'make', 'contemporary', 'chose', 'use', 'somethings', 'play', 'teenager', 'yes', 'kind', 'sound', 'like', 'little', 'girl', 'think', 'wrong', 'part', 'light', 'funny', 'moment', 'movie', 'sven', 'kristoff', 'olaf', 'sven', 'kristoff', 'good', 'character', 'sven', 'laugh', 'movie', 'also', 'endear', 'highlight', 'movie', 'olaf', 'okay', 'cute', 'sweet', 'much', 'toddler', 'script', 'mediocre', 'dialogue', 'atrocious', 'many', 'colloquialism', 'slang', 'quip', 'insult', 'shock', 'could', 'flesh', 'story', 'bit', 'gloss', 'many', 'thing', 'nothing', 'elsa', 'character', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'lead', 'position', 'whereas', 'sven', 'depth', 'closing', 'give', 'worth', 'see', 'merely', 'divide', 'line', 'great', 'movie', 'like', 'find', 'dory', 'inside', 'toy', 'story', 'frozen', 'maybe', 'disney', 'princess', 'pas', 'maybe', 'disney', 'without', 'pixar', 'well']","[231, 1, 838, 1196, 41, 581, 473, 25, 1, 2, 81, 14, 19, 4525, 729, 2139, 449, 239, 2589, 232, 1406, 14, 1106, 661, 814, 3821, 1942, 42, 291, 140, 43, 173, 2, 1, 120, 39, 365, 294, 484, 70, 147, 725, 1, 66, 9, 26, 60, 76, 1586, 28, 17, 2828, 467, 39, 49, 40, 351, 3863, 631, 34, 94, 1, 4, 7, 204, 567, 3003, 104, 10, 751, 28, 1634, 104, 474, 44, 9, 319, 21, 25, 106, 1038, 565, 18, 980, 66, 19, 53, 134, 8, 26, 454, 14, 1287, 56, 195, 661, 54, 549, 21, 113, 43, 33, 947, 27, 947, 58, 11, 155, 2, 790, 59, 202, 45, 176, 30, 13, 2087, 22, 254, 303, 11, 18, 370, 11, 845, 12, 213, 50, 50, 31, 58, 56, 1577, 162, 146, 141, 116, 641, 86, 146, 163, 3332, 50, 641, 2072, 7, 63, 86, 457, 255, 357, 1532, 1533, 3961, 76, 7, 2753, 61, 289, 86, 1374, 140, 8, 137, 209, 86, 116, 86, 518, 838, 838, 838, 163, 1115, 307, 20, 216, 141, 706, 26, 957, 22, 17, 86, 518, 42, 9, 70, 158, 73, 7, 4, 27, 198, 158, 140, 706, 30, 13, 662, 35, 37, 1381, 1382, 4, 19, 13, 2479, 158, 54, 158, 1915, 105, 7, 42, 2, 3757, 65, 65, 227, 289, 237, 248, 1, 54, 14, 1685, 1577, 158, 5057, 204, 1155, 325, 193, 259, 9, 48, 76, 37, 280, 94, 735, 85, 133, 1, 181, 67, 32, 181, 67, 17, 8, 181, 190, 1, 27, 1478, 1358, 1, 32, 420, 265, 457, 31, 4098, 395, 752, 719, 3904, 61, 5181, 4400, 2499, 666, 54, 1620, 12, 95, 2683, 61, 43, 156, 4, 8, 10, 751, 8, 248, 1391, 1565, 181, 609, 2143, 57, 254, 16, 1300, 2643, 213, 25, 1, 9, 71, 4417, 882, 463, 12, 5, 232, 2, 29, 1204, 232, 2, 137, 194, 18]"

Frozen is another fine Disney musical that is, so far, the top-grossing animated movie of all time, and also the most acclaimed wide release animated feature film of 2013 (tied with The Wind Rises). My experience? I did take most of the points off for the script, as it seemed out of touch with common sense that Hans would suddenly become a villain, when in fact the Duke of Weselton would have been fine enough (if Kristoff loves ice, then why wouldn't he choose Elsa? How is that illogical?). Let It Go was fine, though I had much more fun with For The First Time in Forever. I don't know if that's because I prefer Anna's singing voice, but it executed its over-the-top yet still majestic (the animation makes it brilliant, unlike Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2) tone better than Let It Go's coming-of-age-ness. Some of the jokes are funny (I underestimated how much Josh Gad could tickle my humerus as Olaf), but it's mainly the animation and songs that drive it. You might not like Let It Go, but alas I still recommend it for a dose of the mixture of old Disney formulas with modern twists.","['get', 'suppose', 'oh', 'never', 'mind', 'let', 'get', 'review', 'frozen', 'another', 'fine', 'disney', 'musical', 'far', 'top', 'gross', 'animate', 'movie', 'time', 'also', 'acclaim', 'wide', 'release', 'animate', 'feature', 'film', 'tie', 'wind', 'rise', 'experience', 'take', 'point', 'script', 'seem', 'touch', 'common', 'sense', 'han', 'would', 'suddenly', 'become', 'villain', 'fact', 'duke', 'weselton', 'would', 'fine', 'enough', 'kristoff', 'love', 'ice', 'choose', 'elsa', 'illogical', 'let', 'go', 'fine', 'though', 'much', 'fun', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'know', 'prefer', 'anna', 'sing', 'voice', 'execute', 'top', 'yet', 'still', 'majestic', 'animation', 'make', 'brilliant', 'unlike', 'cloudy', 'chance', 'meatball', 'tone', 'well', 'let', 'go', 'come', 'age', 'ness', 'joke', 'funny', 'underestimated', 'much', 'josh', 'gad', 'could', 'tickle', 'humerus', 'olaf', 'mainly', 'animation', 'song', 'drive', 'might', 'like', 'let', 'go', 'ala', 'still', 'recommend', 'dose', 'mixture', 'old', 'disney', 'formula', 'modern', 'twist']","[19, 473, 425, 88, 320, 30, 19, 161, 5, 102, 470, 2, 51, 142, 239, 783, 38, 1, 20, 27, 1942, 1226, 288, 38, 229, 3, 1609, 848, 880, 334, 55, 117, 395, 75, 260, 999, 217, 44, 26, 1033, 179, 104, 201, 762, 1233, 26, 470, 164, 67, 6, 33, 1672, 4, 2586, 30, 13, 470, 100, 31, 125, 36, 20, 287, 56, 957, 7, 63, 86, 1450, 239, 182, 68, 2457, 21, 14, 523, 766, 2428, 632, 2703, 627, 18, 30, 13, 40, 139, 2782, 451, 85, 4738, 31, 275, 257, 54, 3490, 32, 934, 21, 11, 1192, 252, 9, 30, 13, 2749, 68, 262, 4876, 1804, 64, 2, 534, 324, 129]"
978,6,"I approached Disney's 'Frozen' with a certain trepidation, and many people whose opinion I respect have praised it as a radical revamp of the studio's approach to female representation. Hmmm. Well, it's not QUITE that. The requisite Disney princess gets her guy and, in keeping with rom-com tradition, the whole mis-matched couple thing is explored. That's not to say there are no surprises. The interesting tweak to the tale - VERY loosely based on Andersen's 'The Snow Queen' - is providing us with two Princesses, and two classic male-shirt archetypes...so the path toward self-empowerment and self determination is rather less clear-cut than the traditional Disney model. What makes this different from most such tales is not just that the female characters HAVE choices, but that the audience does, also, in determining which whom their sympathies should lie. The character designs, too, combine classic Disney styling with more modern fashion (be warned, parents, lots and lots of little girls are going to want Anna and Elsa toys from The Disney Store, this and every Christmas to come), the Trolls are delightful, and the purplish Sven the reindeer steals the show. Nice voice-work from the cast, particularly Kirsten Bell and the redoubtable Alan Tudyk (Wash now seems to be the go-to-guy for quirky cartoon baddies). My only real criticism would be that there are a few too many songs, the weakness of which is reinforced by having a genuinely memorable better of a song, the authentic 'Let It Go' at the heart of the narrative.

979,7,"Disney movies have a special place in my heart, yet my interest for animated and computer-generated movies had waned in the last few years, until Frozen was kind of forced upon me. Hardly ever have I met so much to like and so much to detest within a single picture. I consider the bulk of the movie maybe the best thing ever made by Walt Disney Animation Studios. I consider the ending ambitious and deeply flawed. For me this dichotomy is so disturbing I had to organize my thoughts by writing my first IMDb-review in over ten years. It will be limited strictly to the story.Linking the manifestations of Elsa's powers to her emotions was a stroke of genius by the screenwriters. This is the one factor that raises Frozen's storyline into the Pantheon of storytelling IMHO. Elsa means well, but can't control her dark side and what it does to others - which mirrors the human psyche in general and is not something usually seen in the black-and-white world of Disney. I heard she was originally intended to be the main villain, but that plan was ditched after the screenwriters heard 'Let it go' and decided after this upbeat song Elsa could never be the antagonist. I couldn't disagree any stronger. No villain is greater (for storytelling purposes) than the believable one. I *really* would have loved to see the movie following its originally planned path. Yet I understand that Disney is the last studio to incorporate villains you can sympathize with into their work. The Elsa portrayed in Frozen remains one of the most interesting characters I ever saw on the big screen. Everything I like about it revolves around her (One little aside: Kind of strange that all the character development Elsa goes through during 'Let it go' about embracing who she is is reversed later on when she learns that even in isolation her powers still effect everyone else).My dislikes stem from the three central relationships being developed throughout Frozen.Between Anna in all her naive optimism and Elsa in her restrained melancholy and grief. This one works so great, especially in the songs they have together. All the time you sense the only chance Elsa has to ever control her powers is through Anna's love for her.Anna and Hans and their love-at-first-sight. Let's forget for a moment how this one turns out and just see it as it seems at first: a Disney stereotype love affair - nothing we haven't seen before, but it works. Anna is adorable anyways and Hans does the right things to be the good guy we like to see involved with Anna.Anna and Kristoff and their budding love. I guess there is more screen time spent on this one than on the other two combined. It feels awkward at first because we know where it is headed while Hans is still in the picture. My Disney spidey senses first went off at this point. Still in the end this one works too as you can feel after Hans turns out to be the villain.Three relationships, and all three of them crafted well or even outstanding. But here is the problem: They were headed on a crash course with each other from the start. Somewhere along the movie everyone senses this on some level. Only one of them could be essential to the catharsis. But how to get the others out of the way without wasting their screen time and the emotional involvement of the viewers?.I agree with the decision to make Hans the villain and open our eyes to how easily we can be deceived if we just purposefully look for love at first sight. I could have liked that unique twist on Disney clichés like Prince Charming and true love between hero and heroine overcoming all obstacles, if it hadn't been so clumsily done. Hans' plan is contrived from start to finish. I feel insulted by the way I was made to believe he was a good guy. You could say he successfully fooled me too, but that is not a hard thing to do when the screenwriters throw him every bone there is on his way. I won't even begin to list all the things he does that have a very small chance of helping his cause yet miraculously do so. Ideally I want to smack my forehead in hindsight because I didn't see a twist coming. No luck with that when the whole thing isn't plausible from the start. So it's not the idea but its implementation that turned out a big stinker here. I cringe just by thinking about his villainous speech.Which leaves the resolution between sibling love and lovers' love. The movie's climax can't be resolved by both of them at the same time. Even if it were possible storytelling wise, it would diminish the impact of each one of them on the audience. When Anna is about to freeze to ice on the Fjord it is not only her choice between two mutually exclusive but both equally desirable actions but also the whole movie's. I may be somewhat old-fashioned in that regard, but I very strongly feel that a good story should not even get to that point: To develop two great emotional story lines only to make itself cast one of them aside. You think the storyline between Kristoff and Anna was not cast aside? Then compare the emotional impact of their first kiss with the one between Belle and Beast...In the end my emotional involvement in two of the three relationship-buildups the movie had was wasted in what seemed a whim to put in surprising twists and subverting Disney stereotypes.I will still love this movie, because I prefer to see the things I like while disregarding those I don't. So for me Frozen will always be just about Anna and Elsa.","['disney', 'movie', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'yet', 'interest', 'animate', 'computer', 'generate', 'movie', 'wan', 'last', 'year',

980,7,"I personally like Frozen. The visuals, characters, and voice acting are superb. Unfortunately, the Plot, the Protagonist, and the Villain are badly done. The budget for Frozen was 150 MILLION$ so I thought it would be a extremely simple plot or a extremely complex one. I was wrong Disney thought that combining both extremes would work. They were mistaken. The plot tries to do to much and in reality does very little. For example: The Beginning was simple so was the Ending. But everything In between tried to do to much. By adding Kristoff as a possible love interest for Anna instead of Hans. My main problem with that is ANNA IS ENGAGED so Disney should have made him just a friend. Another problem with the movie was the protagonist. I knew Anna was going to be one of the main characters but i thought she would have had the same importance as Hans or Kristoff and Elsa would be the protagonist because Elsa's simply a better character. I was wrong yet again as Anna not Elsa was the protagonist. My next problem is the Villain. All of the audience knew it wasn't Anna,Olaf,Kristoff or Elsa so i thought Hans was going to be the Villain. It wasn't surprising that Hans was the Villain but, my issue with that is that Hans was a gentleman while Kristoff was a mountain man. If Kristoff and Hans were switched and Hans was a Good Guy and Kristoff was the Villain, my predictions for a regular Disney movie would have been shattered. My one major problem with Frozen is that it had no Likable/RELATABLE Male Characters. But had MANY Likable/RELATABLE Female Characters. Anna And Elsa were Likable/RELATABLE. But any Male Characters were not. Those are my main problems with Frozen. Please do not hate.

And I expect animations like this to be funny, it wasn't really. Not to mention that the plot has its own problems.

982,9,"""The movie is beyond a repertoire of the classic girl meets prince, prince marries girl and they lived happy ever after.""Frozen is a 2013 animated musical film from Walt Disney Pictures which is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee and initially released November 10, 2013 in the entire US, and November 27, 2013 here in the Philippines. Frozen is starred by Idina Menzel as Elsa, the Snow Queen, Kristen Belle as Anna, sister of Elsa, Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, Santino Fontana as Hans, a prince in another kingdom and Josh Gad as Olaf, the snowman.The story of Frozen is an adaptation from an epic fairy tale of Hans Christian Andersen entitled The Snow Queen. Frozen follows the story of a young princess who is destined to resurrect the kingdom from an eternal winter caused by her sister with the help of a dreamy stranger with his loyal reindeer and a naively funny snowman.The movie is beyond a repertoire of the classic girl meets prince, prince marries girl and they lived happy ever after. And to be straightforward; I loved every bit of it.STORYEvery princess needs a prince, and the princess needed to marry him a day after they've met. Thank God they have magnified that monotonic fairytale cliché into a comic scene in the movie and never made it as the centermost crunch. Instead, they focused more on the dilemma of siblings and how truer it is than finding a guy who sparkles in the middle of the woods. (Hi Twitards)The story revolves when young Elsa accidentally freezes (more like a curse) her younger sister Anna which the troll healed by making her forget about Elsa's powers for her to keep away from the uncontrolled danger Elsa's going to put her sister in to. And that's where the depth of the story gets in when both sisters are kept away from each other.The content of the story was enough to create a depth to feel the weariness and longing of a person for love; but not just any kind of love, but a sisterly love and how you'll do anything for family.But well, of course, there is a romantic tone in the movie; it wouldn't be a Walt Disney fairytale film if not for that, only, it's more of a supporting story rather than the main plot. And I am so proud of Disney bringing up the thought to children that fairy tales don't compensate the morale of a boy-girl relationship only, no; it also includes friends especially family.OSTFrozen is a musical animated film, and so there are a lot of singing that's happening in the film, and it's so delightful to hear a pop feel to the songs in the movie. Tangled has already started the trend of it before, which was a bit of musical feel rather than a pure pop-song, but still successful.But the movie Frozen has a lot of good songs to offer. I am so much enticed by Do You Want to Build a Snowman who tunes about Anna waiting from childhood to teenage years for her sister to open the door for them to play again, after the unfortunate incident when they were young and how longing the feel of the song was. Also the song Let It Go which was covered by Demi Lovato as an official song for the movie, which was about letting go of all the halls barred on Elsa's way; about not hiding her powers anymore from anyone and how free she is to build a castle on the top of the highest mountain in their kingdom.There are a lot of good songs in the movie which are fancy to hear; especially Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel's duet, For the First Time in Forever and Josh Gad's (Olaf) In Summer which tells a tale about the snowman who wants to experience summer that totally cracked me up on my seat.HUMORHumor was not off or heavy, it was just exact for every scene. And the superstar comic character in the movie was Olaf, the snowman. Olaf's naïve attitude made a perfect fun dialogue for the entire time he's on screen.OVERALLIn totality, the movie was pure awesome. It's now top 2 of the best opening for an animated Walt Disney movie since Lion King. The latter was a classic, and now, Frozen is another epic. I have so much fun watching it in the entire time I was there. Never a dull moment, indeed, and the story was necessary.(This review is also seen on my blog, One Setting at a Time)","['movie', 'beyond', 'repertoire', 'classic', 'girl', 'meet', 'prince', 'prince',

983,6,"Disney movies have kind of crashed and burned with old adult fans in recent years, bringing us films like Planes and Tangled. They have however, broken new ground, such as featuring an African-American Princess, and setting a Pixar film in Scotland. Some of the most recent Disney films don't focus on love, rather friendship, such as Brave. Frozen is a love story, but it has a few more elements added in, such as you can't trust everyone you meet, and that running away and hiding doesn't solve all of our problems. It also shows that truly nice people don't always finish last, as Kristoff goes from a lowly ice deliverer to the friend of Anna, and there's not really much more to it. They don't get married at the end of the story, which is a nice change of pace.I've heard from many that this film is groundbreaking, and it isn't. It just features a lot of charming characters and a different storyline from the Disney movies of 2005-2013. It could definitely be considered for the Classic Disney library in the future though.I'd say watch, but don't expect to agree with the critics claiming it's groundbreaking when it's over","['disney', 'movie', 'kind', 'crashed', 'burn', 'old', 'adult', 'fan', 'recent', 'year', 'bring', 'u', 'film', 'like', 'plane', 'tangle', 'however', 'broken', 'new', 'ground', 'feature', 'african', 'american', 'princess', 'set', 'pixar', 'film', 'scotland', 'recent', 'disney', 'film', 'focus', 'love', 'rather', 'friendship', 'brave', 'frozen', 'love', 'story', 'element', 'add', 'trust', 'everyone', 'meet', 'run', 'away', 'hiding', 'solve', 'problem', 'also', 'show', 'truly', 'nice', 'people', 'always', 'finish', 'last', 'kristoff', 'go', 'lowly', 'ice', 'deliverer', 'friend', 'anna', 'really', 'much', 'get', 'married', 'end', 'story', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'heard', 'many', 'film', 'groundbreaking', 'feature', 'lot', 'charm', 'character', 'different', 'storyline', 'disney', 'movie', 'could', 'definitely', 'consider', 'classic', 'disney', 'library', 'future', 'though', 'say', 'watch', 'expect', 'agree', 'critic', 'claim', 'groundbreaking']","[2, 1, 193, 2700, 64, 147, 176, 399, 47, 221, 177, 3, 9, 1966, 83, 110, 1245, 108, 1051, 229, 2585, 1413, 29, 144, 194, 3, 399, 2, 3, 261, 6, 191, 1003, 335, 5, 6, 12, 401, 269, 836, 109, 244, 233, 101, 1744, 1684, 198, 27, 78, 329, 192, 46, 163, 855, 197, 67, 13, 33, 327, 7, 22, 31, 19, 895, 41, 12, 192, 209, 564, 357, 61, 3, 1546, 229, 84, 235, 8, 140, 295, 2, 1, 54, 174, 421, 69, 2, 2366, 607, 100, 35, 23, 131, 729, 730, 1042, 1546]"
984,9,"Frozen, Disney's newest animated brainchild, hit theatres this past holiday season. People ""fan girl-ing"" over a new Disney movie is not exactly something to raise an eyebrow at but, this time, with Frozen's progressive main characters, storyline and Broadway talent, the commotion is well deserved. Main characters, Princess Anna (Kristen Bell) and Princess Elsa (Idina Menzel) grow up as typical Disney movie kids (singing in perfect pitch as one experiments with magic powers). When Elsa's powers get out of hand, the king and queen lock her up. Elsa is condemned to a life of concealment and shame for her ""curse."" Years pass until Elsa bravely steps into the spotlight to take the throne. At the coronation, Elsa fails to keep control and her powers are revealed. In embarrassment and fear, Elsa flees the kingdom, leaving Arendell in an eternal winter. Now it is up to Anna to save the kingdom and the ice queen, from herself. Along the way, audiences are introduced to two competing love interests, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Hans (Santino Fontana). Josh Gad brings comedic relief (some of the best Disney has ever had, claim some) with hilarious one liners as Olaf, the bumbling snowman sidekick. Frozen introduces audiences to the front runners of a new generation of Disney Princesses. Elsa and Anna are worlds away from the coy and drowsy female leads of Disney's past. (By drowsy, I'm talking Snow White and Aurora neither of whom could even stay awake for their entire film!) The ladies of Frozen have broken the mold with their unapologetic strength, courage, common sense, and awkwardly likable sense of humor. During her time alone in the mountains Elsa exclaims ""Yes I'm alone! But I'm alone and free!"" showing that being able to be her true self and loving herself is what is truly important to her. Anna strays from the poised, passive, even pathetic princess archetype. She is raw and real. She trips a few times, cracks some awkward jokes even stuffs her face with chocolate. She reaches role model potential when, without hesitation, she sets off to find her sister on her own and immediately declines Hans's offer to go with her. The men have progressed as well. Anna is the heroine of the tale but her sidekick is Kristoff, a man. Even better yet, he is not threatened by this at all. Writers even went as far as to poke fun at the ridiculous ""love at first sight"" theme that is prevalent in most of Disney's ""princess movies."" There are multiple points in the film when Anna is criticized for getting engaged to Hans, a man she just met. Per Disney tradition the folks of Arendell are all musically inclined, believe it or not every single one of them graced the Broadway stage. Bell's performance came as the biggest surprise. Her tone is sweet and innocent but still strong and convincing. She breathes life into the character and makes Anna a proper role model for young girls. Bell is able to hold her own alongside Broadway big wig and Tony Award winner Menzel, who did not disappoint. The movie's anthem ""Let It Go"" was actually written for Menzel to showcase her extensive vocal range. With its deep, poignant lyrics and flawless execution, it is no wonder that ""Let It Go"" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Frozen is a breath of fresh air, a perfect movie for the kids and the kids at heart of today. It has taken the world by storm, snow storm that is.","['frozen', 'disney', 'new', 'animate', 'brainchild', 'hit', 'theatre', 'past', 'holiday', 'season', 'people', 'fan', 'girl', 'ing', 'new', 'disney', 'movie', 'exactly', 'something', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'time', 'frozen', 'progressive', 'main', 'character', 'storyline', 'broadway', 'talent', 'commotion', 'well', 'deserve', 'main', 'character', 'princess', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'princess', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'grow', 'typical', 'disney', 'movie', 'kid', 'sing', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'one', 'experiment', 'magic', 'power', 'elsa', 'power', 'get', 'hand', 'king', 'queen', 'lock', 'elsa', 'condemn', 'life', 'concealment', 'shame', 'curse', 'year', 'pas', 'elsa', 'bravely', 'step', 'spotlight', 'take', 'throne', 'coronation', 'elsa', 'fails', 'keep', 'control', 'power', 'reveal', 'embarrassment', 'fear', 'elsa', 'flees', 'kingdom', 'leave', 'arendell', 'eternal', 'winter', 'anna', 'save', 'kingdom', 'ice', 'queen', 'along', 'way', 'audience', 'introduce', 'two', 'compete', 'love', 'interest', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'han', 'santino', 'fontana', 'josh', 'gad', 'brings', 'comedic', 'relief', 'best', 'disney', 'ever', 'claim', 'hilarious', 'one', 'liner', 'olaf', 'bumbling', 'snowman', 'sidekick', 'frozen', 'introduces', 'audience', 'front', 'runner', 'new', 'generation', 'disney', 'princess', 'elsa', 'anna', 'world', 'away', 'coy', 'drowsy', 'female', 'lead', 'disney', 'past', 'drowsy', 'talk', 'snow', 'white', 'aurora', 'neither', 'could', 'even', 'stay', 'awake', 'entire', 'film', 'lady', 'frozen', 'broken', 'mold', 'unapologetic', 'strength', 'courage', 'common', 'sense', 'awkwardly', 'likable', 'sense', 'humor', 'time', 'alone', 'mountain', 'elsa', 'exclaims', 'yes', 'alone', 'alone', 'free', 'show', 'able', 'true', 'self', 'love', 'truly', 'important', 'anna', 'stray', 'poise', 'passive', 'even', 'pathetic', 'princess', 'archetype', 'raw', 'real', 'trip', 'time', 'crack', 'awkward', 'joke', 'even', 'stuff', 'face', 'chocolate', 'reach', 'role', 'model', 'potential', 'without', 'hesitation', 'set', 'find', 'sister', 'immediately', 'decline', 'han', 'offer', 'go', 'men', 'progress', 'well', 'anna', 'heroine', 'tale', 'sidekick', 'kristoff', 'man', 'even', 'well', 'yet', 'threaten', 'writer', 'even', 'go', 'far', 'poke', 'fun', 'ridiculous', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'theme', 'prevalent', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'multiple', 'point', 'film', 'anna', 'criticize', 'get', 'engage', 'han', 'man', 'met', 'per', 'disney', 'tradition', 'folk', 'arendell', 'musically', 'inclined', 'believe', 'every', 'single', 'one', 'grace', 'broadway', 'stage', 'bell', 'performance', 'come', 'big', 'surprise', 'tone', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'still', 'strong', 'convincing', 'breathes', 'life', 'character', 'make', 'anna', 'proper', 'role', 'model', 'young', 'girl', 'bell', 'able', 'hold', 'alongside', 'broadway', 'big', 'wig', 'tony', 'award', 'winner', 'menzel', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'anthem', 'let', 'go', 'actually', 'write', 'menzel', 'showcase', 'extensive', 'vocal', 'range', 'deep', 'poignant', 'lyric', 'flawless', 'execution', 'wonder', 'let', 'go', 'nominate', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'original', 'song', 'frozen', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'perfect', 'movie', 'kid', 'kid', 'heart', 'today', 'take', 'world', 'storm', 'snow', 'storm']","[5, 2, 108, 38, 234, 1275, 276, 1039, 1040, 46, 176, 76, 4704, 108, 2, 1, 522, 89, 760, 4471, 20, 5, 1990, 119, 8, 295, 411, 800, 18, 483, 119, 8, 29, 7, 162, 146, 29, 4, 141, 116, 285, 376, 2, 1, 60, 63, 175, 2024, 10, 5188, 150, 24, 4, 24, 19, 323, 97, 49, 382, 4, 3730, 79, 1403, 405, 47, 1204, 4, 2981, 668, 2042, 55, 952, 343, 4, 1052, 154, 128, 24, 528, 3960, 187, 4, 710, 77, 322, 2745, 310, 105, 7, 111, 77, 33, 49, 172, 50, 159, 736, 42, 2738, 6, 122, 67, 455, 377, 44, 688, 665, 275, 257, 509, 1043, 297, 34, 2, 81, 1042, 364, 10, 3761, 32, 2925, 45, 436, 5, 3025, 159, 938, 108, 616, 2, 29, 4, 7, 126, 101, 5189, 237, 248, 2, 276, 5189, 178, 39, 365, 3101, 1197, 54, 28, 510, 2572, 264, 3, 1599, 5, 1245, 2308, 887, 1689, 999, 217, 3120, 402, 217, 222, 20, 344, 214, 4, 325, 344, 344, 593, 78, 294, 62, 429, 6, 329, 289, 7, 2406, 2184, 4557, 28, 1980, 29, 2417, 195, 1066, 20, 1713, 810, 451, 28, 698, 381, 1779, 1046, 371, 753, 685, 137, 5190, 144, 71, 15, 597, 3171, 44, 705, 13, 459, 1149, 18, 7, 565, 114, 436, 67, 145, 28, 18, 182, 2517, 605, 28, 13, 142, 1794, 125, 1195, 6, 36, 675, 226, 3795, 2, 29, 1, 1418, 117, 3, 7, 1339, 19, 619, 44, 145, 392, 2987, 2, 1071, 1417, 2745, 1769, 2609, 220, 115, 741, 10, 1738, 411, 1115, 146, 493, 40, 106, 445, 627, 457, 1315, 68, 167, 2032, 79, 8, 14, 7, 2195, 371, 753, 73, 76, 146, 294, 655, 1644, 411, 106, 4388, 3991, 469, 1419, 116, 808, 1, 3078, 30, 13, 103, 165, 116, 2125, 4873, 821, 958, 574, 5062, 475, 1132, 1534, 532, 30, 13, 1463, 856, 469, 34, 230, 11, 5, 990, 819, 1323, 175, 1, 60, 60, 80, 674, 55, 126, 713, 39, 713]"
985,9,"I'll start by stating that I haven't watched many of the more recently released Disney movies. I actually watched this by accident and couldn't stop. I'm not going to pretend to write up some super snazzy review, trying to impress people with references and comparisons. Here's the deal - it's extremely well animated. The facial expressions are so precise I feel like you could watch the movie in silence and easily understand everything. The characters had missed opportunities in their development but, being based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale and how dark that story is, they accomplish enough. I've noticed that, in many instances, the folks giving this poor reviews always seem to mention things like ""I figured out what would happen..."" or ""it was so cliché..."". You can't go in to movies like that. There is a lot of thoughtfulness in this film that makes it very deep. Perhaps you've had to have experienced things like losing a parent or parents, realizing your own personal flaw(s) and how they shut others out of your life or even not knowing your own weaknesses. Anyhow, I was pleasantly surprised by this film and would highly recommend it to anyone of any age. If you go into it cynically, with a thought process that it's just another Disney film with the usually expected story lines, I don't think you'll get to experience it as it was meant to be. I do wish they had developed Elsa's character more but, in the end, the pain and suffering inferred from being shut out of the world for over 15 years of her life has to be taken into consideration.Let It Go is absolutely brilliant. Fantastic performance by Idina. In that sequence, after watching it numerous times, there is a point where Elsa seems to melt the snow... just once. Right as she sings ""slam the door"" and throws her hands backwards, it sure looks like the snow in the air behind her melts and falls very quickly. I am thinking that it was an indication of her finally freeing her mind and accepting herself for who she is, finding love in that. Also, since Olaf was built about 3 seconds before that, I am thinking that's when he was given life.Way off track now... just see this. It's brilliantly animated and enjoyable for people of all ages. I fall into the group of people who cried during this one. Certain experiences in your own life will allow you to connect with aspects of this storyline more than others might.","['start', 'state', 'watch', 'many', 'recently', 'release', 'disney', 'movie', 'actually', 'watch', 'accident', 'stop', 'go', 'pretend', 'write', 'super', 'snazzy', 'review', 'try', 'impress', 'people', 'reference', 'comparison', 'deal', 'extremely', 'well', 'animate', 'facial', 'expression', 'precise', 'feel', 'like', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'silence', 'easily', 'understand', 'everything', 'character', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'development', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'tale', 'dark', 'story', 'accomplish', 'enough', 'notice', 'many', 'instance', 'folk', 'give', 'poor', 'review', 'always', 'seem', 'mention', 'thing', 'like', 'figure', 'would', 'happen', 'clich', 'go', 'movie', 'like', 'lot', 'thoughtfulness', 'film', 'make', 'deep', 'perhaps', 'experienced', 'thing', 'like', 'lose', 'parent', 'parent', 'realize', 'personal', 'flaw', 'shut', 'others', 'life', 'even', 'know', 'weakness', 'anyhow', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'age', 'go', 'cynically', 'thought', 'process', 'another', 'disney', 'film', 'usually', 'expect', 'story', 'line', 'think', 'get', 'experience', 'meant', 'wish', 'developed', 'elsa', 'character', 'end', 'pain', 'suffer', 'infer', 'shut', 'world', 'year', 'life', 'take', 'consideration', 'let', 'go', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'idina', 'sequence', 'watch', 'numerous', 'time', 'point', 'elsa', 'seem', 'melt', 'snow', 'right', 'sings', 'slam', 'door', 'throw', 'hand', 'backwards', 'sure', 'look', 'like', 'snow', 'air', 'behind', 'melt', 'fall', 'quickly', 'think', 'indication', 'finally', 'free', 'mind', 'accept', 'find', 'love', 'also', 'since', 'olaf', 'built', 'second', 'think', 'give', 'life', 'way', 'track', 'see', 'brilliantly', 'animate', 'enjoyable', 'people', 'age', 'fall', 'group', 'people', 'cry', 'one', 'certain', 'experience', 'life', 'allow', 'connect', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'others', 'might']","[120, 881, 23, 61, 1253, 288, 2, 1, 103, 23, 480, 284, 13, 1970, 165, 998, 161, 87, 1433, 46, 1246, 1126, 701, 423, 18, 38, 1482, 1069, 5191, 53, 9, 54, 23, 1, 5055, 403, 216, 132, 8, 271, 759, 356, 256, 44, 245, 339, 114, 628, 12, 2883, 164, 692, 61, 1758, 1417, 57, 973, 161, 163, 75, 348, 43, 9, 630, 26, 290, 274, 13, 1, 9, 84, 3, 14, 574, 578, 1451, 43, 9, 489, 118, 118, 428, 537, 386, 686, 247, 79, 28, 56, 2819, 3691, 1633, 703, 3, 26, 472, 262, 299, 139, 13, 92, 1097, 102, 2, 3, 460, 131, 12, 213, 37, 19, 334, 868, 417, 610, 4, 8, 41, 1765, 888, 686, 126, 47, 79, 55, 3267, 30, 13, 292, 523, 253, 493, 141, 502, 23, 1874, 20, 117, 4, 75, 359, 39, 130, 794, 3051, 478, 744, 323, 2326, 207, 66, 9, 39, 1323, 750, 359, 186, 733, 37, 5150, 241, 593, 320, 869, 71, 6, 27, 98, 32, 787, 319, 37, 57, 79, 50, 932, 16, 1849, 38, 306, 46, 139, 186, 849, 46, 505, 10, 563, 334, 79, 833, 1397, 443, 295, 247, 252]"
986,8,"I did enjoy this movie after just watching it with my partner. The one thing I did notice however, was the amount of awkward singing in the first half hour of the movie. I think a song every twenty minutes or so would have been fine but they went over the top with them, too many in a short space of time and they were very out of place and awkward. Other than that the film was good, the characters were perfect, the twist with Hans I really didn't expect and that made the film a lot darker which I enjoyed. Olaf the snowman was a funny character and will appeal to the younger children due to his goofiness. The ending was really surprising as it showed that not all ""true love"" movies had to be the same. It showed that the true love doesn't always come from ""prince charming"" but rather family members, which was a great touch for those looking for some deeper meanings. Visuals were great and the characters likable.

But I do suggest this movie to everyone ! It will make your little siblings laugh and they will seriously enjoy this movie. It is worth the $8.50.

988,10,"Ten is for excellent, not perfect. Indeed, even ""Snow White"" has it's flaws, including a few scenes ""mistracked"" as photographed by the multi-plane camera, frame-by-frame. Disney Princesses are present in most of the best animated works. (In ""101 Dalmatians"" there is no princess, for example.)The last glut of successful recent releases all include red-headed, ""spunky"" leads: Tangled, Brave, and now Frozen. I like Tangled almost as much as Frozen, as the story has more ""bite"" and has a ""traditional"" wicked witch in it. The floating ""lanterns"" at the climax of Tangled are quite beautiful. All these Disney Animated Features have one thing in common: they are ""light operas"" where larger portions of the dialogue are sung, not spoken. Here, it's almost overdone, as not all of the songs are THAT memorable, are they? The story is a bit watered-down, as I remember the ""Snow Queen"" being a lot more evil in the previous mostly-live action productions. Hallmark Entertainment did a good one in 2002. Also, some of the spoken the dialogue is insipid and childish at times. Here, Elsa's ""touch of frost"" becomes a King Midas-like Curse, and I don't remember it being quite that way in other versions. The computer-generated illustrations are spellbinding with intricate patterns of ice and snow. ""Sven"" the reindeer owes a lot to the talking ones from ""Santa Clause"". Olaf the Snowman looks a lot like a familiar Muppet, and offers comic relief when the plot overwhelms us. The ""Marshmallow Troll"" is just scary enough-watch for the ""Easter Egg"" about him after the ending credits! Both ""Sven & ""Olaf"" are adorable and are meant to entertain little kids while the adults enjoy the movie. Walt Disney himself paid attention to this detail as well. Both Princesses Elsa and Anna look a little Barbie-Dollish, don't they, with ""impossibly perfect"" figures? The selfish-cad of a Prince is a clever plot twist. The magical trolls are also a clever stand-in for the ""7 Dwarfs"".

993,10,"Frozen is among one of the best films in the history of computer animation, if not the history of motion picture in my fallible, human opinion and analysis.
The story is both touching and moving as it is very relatable for everyone regardless of their backgrounds. With gritty humors that aren't overused balancing the depth of its emotional parts and values, Frozen explores a theme rarely explored by films in general, about siblings growing up and discovering the true meaning of love and family after being separated when everything seems right at some point in time. Despite being inspired by a fairy tale (Hans Christian Andersen's ""Snow Queen"") and having magic as one of its key elements, creative liberties were taken into account to successfully deliver the philosophical themes and messages about separation, psychological growth, self discovery, freedom, determination, romance, acceptance, family, and happiness; making Frozen a meaningful, entertaining, and educative fantasy-adventure movie with a bit of everything from all the movie genres in the right amount of pace and duration.
Frozen's hallmark also comes from its array of unique characters with deep personalities and characterizations. The characters are relatable as they are flawed like any normal people and their hurdles are understandable when compared to what a person may endure in life. Even the presence of the movie's antagonist subtly explains the message that one should never judge a book by its cover and life will not always go as one might plan and expect. These, along with the passionate, hearty acting and charming vocals from Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars), Idina Menzel (Wicked), Josh Gad (Book of Mormon), and a host of other talented casts bring their respective characters to a vivid, living state and the movie to whole other level of quality entertainment.
The gorgeous animation is supplemented by various sub-elements that correlate and unite together to form nothing short of a marvel in a film. First, the production team and animation department greatly incorporated actual realism and scientific researches into the movie; the production team incorporated Scandinavian geography, environment, cultures, traditions, arts, history, mythology, and consulted with experts to create astonishing details with the visuals, costumes, landscapes, kingdom, architecture, towns, and runic languages just to name a few. Some of the other scientific researches conducted include the animation team's study of snow and meteorology to create life-like snow and the creation of a special new animation program just for this purpose called Matterhorn, a visit to an ice hotel in Quebec to study how lights would reflect on icy surfaces for scenes in Elsa's ice palace, the study of trichology and the creation of another new program called Tonic to animate the characters' hair and strands. Next, simple gestures, colors, and lighting are utilized not just to spice each frame, but to also symbolize what the characters are experiencing and aligns remarkably well with the cinematography.
The songs are not just catchy and iconic to each of the characters, but also excellent in terms of the build-ups, tunes, melodies, and earworms; not to mention they are used to advance the plot forward, enrich the characters' personalities, and open for interpretations for audiences of all ages to relate. The music and score suit and elevate every single part of the movie from the very first opening seconds until the end credits scene while paying homage to the Scandinavian lore and cultures.
For everyone who may dislike or even actively hate Frozen without ever seeing it, it's highly advisable to watch it thoroughly with objectivity and not with subjectivity before judging the quality of it and pretty much any other movie. It is also a perfectly normal, human thing to criticize or not like something, but it would be a rather immature act for criticism to be done with apathy, ignorance, disrespect, and hatred. And it also must be noted that a great story or film doesn't necessarily require action scenes and violence.
Finally, no human is perfect and nor will they ever be, not to mention their creation; but all in all the flaws of this movie (mainly about the controversial decision a minor character took early on in the film and the plot twist close to the ending) are rather minuscule and eclipsed by the truth that Frozen has plenty of brilliance of its own to which they are proven by the numerous awards it has rightfully earned.
Frozen is without a doubt considered a modern classic or perhaps even a timeless classic for many, and is a personal all-time favorite movie that is now a part of my life and literally changed me to become a better human being.","['frozen', 'among', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'history', 'computer', 'animation', 'history', 'motion', 'picture', 'fallible', 'human', 'opinion', 'analysis', 'story',

994,10,"I originally became interested in this movie because of family. My 2nd cousin (my mom's great-niece), who is 9 YEARS OLD (2 YEARS BEFORE the movie) is named ELSA. My grandma (her great grandma) was 100% Swedish.
The 1st thing that struck me is the OBVIOUS Christian messages. Elsa & Kristoff deride Anna for accepting a marriage proposal from someone she had met THAT DAY (which is the plot of most Disney Princess stories), & they were right. Grandpabbie tells Kristoff & Anna that ""only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart."" And, Olaf tells Anna that ""Love is putting someone else's needs before yours.""
The 2nd thing that struck me, though not as obvious, is the parallel between Elsa & people with Autism Spectrum Disorders, which includes my brother & I (though I was diagnosed as an adult). Elsa is feared due to her powers, & Prince Hans tells her ""don't be the monster they fear you are."" People with ASD's are viewed the same way, due to fictional characters like Lennie in ""Of Mice & Men."" Like Elsa's powers, the general public views ASD as negative, something to be hidden. By the end of the story, Elsa's powers have been shown to be an asset, also. This is similar to people with ASD's (like fictional characters in ""The Good Doctor"" & ""Rain Man, "" & real people like Dr. Temple Grandin & Kodi Lee), who publicly display the BENEFITS associated with ASD.","['originally', 'become', 'interested', 'movie', 'family', 'nd', 'cousin', 'mom', 'great', 'niece', 'year', 'old', 'year', 'movie', 'name', 'elsa', 'grandma', 'great', 'grandma', 'swedish', 'st', 'thing', 'struck', 'obvious', 'christian', 'message', 'elsa', 'kristoff', 'deride', 'anna', 'accept', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'someone', 'met', 'day', 'plot', 'disney', 'princess', 'story', 'right', 'grandpabbie', 'tell', 'kristoff', 'anna', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'thaw', 'frozen', 'heart', 'olaf', 'tell', 'anna', 'love', 'put', 'someone', 'else', 'need', 'nd', 'thing', 'struck', 'though', 'obvious', 'parallel', 'elsa', 'people', 'autism', 'spectrum', 'disorder', 'include', 'brother', 'though', 'diagnose', 'adult', 'elsa', 'fear', 'due', 'power', 'prince', 'han', 'tell', 'monster', 'fear', 'people', 'asd', 'view', 'way', 'due', 'fictional', 'character', 'like', 'lennie', 'mouse', 'men', 'like', 'elsa', 'power', 'general', 'public', 'view', 'asd', 'negative', 'something', 'hidden', 'end', 'story', 'elsa', 'power', 'show', 'asset', 'also', 'similar', 'people', 'asd', 'like', 'fictional', 'character', 'good', 'doctor', 'rain', 'man', 'real', 'people', 'like', 'dr', 'temple', 'grandin', 'kodi', 'lee', 'publicly', 'display', 'benefit', 'associate', 'asd']","[1511, 179, 946, 1, 72, 1897, 2058, 1109, 25, 1340, 47, 64, 47, 1, 183, 4, 5198, 25, 5198, 3088, 1405, 43, 1367, 595, 245, 185, 4, 67, 7, 869, 1057, 3149, 304, 392, 138, 52, 2, 29, 12, 130, 143, 67, 7, 112, 62, 6, 775, 5, 80, 32, 143, 7, 6, 196, 304, 270, 99, 1897, 43, 1367, 100, 595, 2239, 4, 46, 349, 865, 100, 147, 4, 187, 404, 24, 82, 44, 143, 495, 187, 46, 3335, 413, 50, 404, 1588, 8, 9, 707, 459, 9, 4, 24, 623, 1328, 413, 3335, 761, 89, 994, 41, 12, 4, 24, 78, 5015, 27, 446, 46, 3335, 9, 1588, 8, 17, 3469, 3423, 145, 195, 46, 9, 2871, 416, 3980, 1151, 1711, 2793, 3335]"

Nobody questioned that keeping someone locked in a room for 20 years might be a bad idea?

997,7,"Frozen is set here as a loose adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's book The Snow Queen but here in this Disney universe she is a misunderstood character and someone that can be more relatable to audiences (this was something that Disney have tried to tell for a long time). Here we start with young Elsa (The Snow Queen in question) accidentally ice blasting her young sister Anna in the face, to which the parents rush her to a bunch of Trolls for one of them to save Anna and manipulate her memories so that she won't remember of her sisters powers. We get a montage then of how the two grow up, parents die and eventually stop at Elsa getting crowned as The Queen of the Kingdom. Of course things go wrong as Elsa accidentally reveals her powers to the Kingdom and runs away, also putting the Kingdom into eternal winter in the process. Anna decides to run off to find her sister to remove the eternal winter while joined on her quest by Kristoff, an ice master, and his reindeer Sven.Well Disney Animation at least has been picking up a bit of form recently what with Tangled and Wreck It Ralph and now Frozen continues the momentum for the studio to be back being big game players once again.No matter how many Pixar or Dreamworks films you have watched over the last decade or more, you honestly can't help but enjoy a by the numbers Disney film with some heart and musical numbers, which Frozen brings in spades. Sure some of the musical numbers are kind of forgettable (For one I can't remember one word right now from the song by the Trolls and I only watched it last night) but you'll be at least humming away or singing inside your head to the big belter 'Let It Go' (Which won an Oscar for Best Song) as well as 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman' or for more funnier reasons 'In Summer'.The start of the film is decent enough but you hoped that some things were developed more with Elsa, after all she is the Snow Queen but don't really answer the origin of the powers and actually throughout the film she's kind of the background character that gets the other characters something to do while she runs off and builds her ice castle on a mountain topas you do. Despite a spectacular misjudgement of character from Anna, which I'm sure would have annoyed a number of cynical people (meets guy for literally 5 minutes and a song and gets engaged), but I liked her character as she stands by her sister regardless and ultimately that's where the heart of the film lies in is this sisterhood.As much as this film has positives there is negativesquite a number of them. The structure of the story jumps from time to time, with this story being in development hell quite a few times it seems that several ideas are still there but not touched (Elsa's powers – where did they come from? Anna gets her memories incepted and yet THAT doesn't come back in the plot at all the rest of the film? ). The villain plot twist was expected and got the point of that but that leading into the ending it all felt a bit rushed to me.Kristen Bell and Idena Menzel do a great job as the sisters and the show stealer goes to Josh Gad as snowman Olaf who randomly comes into the film halfway through at the right time to provide the laughs for the rest of the film.Few songs they could've done without and the ending felt a bit rushed but overall it's a great return to form that Disney is forming here from the Tangled era onwards.

998,8,"I was so impressed by this movie! It was visually stunning but thankfully this time the gorgeous graphics were accompanied by a great cast, great songs and a clever, amusing script.The story follows two sisters, Elsa and Anna. Elsa, who possesses a little magic, accidentally injures her sister during a game and the rest of the movie is the consequence of Elsa being told by trolls to fear her gift and keep herself away from everyone else in case she hurts them.I really enjoyed that this movie didn't follow the usual princess/true love's kiss pattern. Yes there is true love but of a different kind, which was fabulous to see. Some people are commenting on the lack of chemistry/true love between Anna and Kristoff and I agree, but I didn't mind that as the story isn't really about romantic love, and with their first, tentative kiss right at the end I think that this was just the beginning of their story if they're meant to have one! Otherwise the movie is all about love and what that means to different people, whether it's a romantic crush, love for a pet/companion or keeping someone safe, sharing your problems or simply understanding and being there for each other.I also loved that this was such a talented cast (with a LOT of Broadway experience) and that some of the songs sounded exactly like you would expect to hear in a stage musical. The cast was perfectly suited to the songs: 'Let It Go' was simply stunning both visually and musically, and Idina Menzel's vocal range is just extraordinary, although I was a bit disappointed that Jonathan Groff was so underused. The guy can sing so why didn't he? Aside from that, the songs were brilliant, clever and catchy with a few ambiguous lyrics to amuse the adults. Then come the light relief characters, Sven the Reindeer-cross-puppy and Olaf the snowman, who were adorable and funny.As for baddies, I liked the red herring and twist! Again some comments address whether the baddie was evil enough. I personally liked that Frozen explores varying degrees of badness in contrast to the types of love, although nothing *very* bad happens. Peril is pretty mild, yet I found the whole thing very gripping, moving and, often, very sad. I felt so sorry for both sisters for much of the film, but happily it all turns out well in the end! Now, I do have a few niggles which stopped me giving it 10 stars. Partly that Groff never sings, but also plot issues. The trolls play a strange little part in the story which is discussed extensively in a few threads. But basically a lot of the problems in the film are essentially their fault! It's as simple as ignoring advice from a magic talking rock and none of the problems and sadness needed to happen! Listen to their lines and lyrics and you get a hint that maybe these cute little rock creatures aren't as benevolent as they appear (plus they're manipulative and hypocritical). But they aren't the official baddies so what exactly is their purpose? Might need to watch it again just to study the trolls (any excuse!!) and figure out why they have such influence.You also never find out how Elsa manages to control her powers at the end, or how Olaf came to life in the first place, or what happened to Kristoff's parents that the trolls took him in (love the kidnapping theories on here!)... Minor, but niggles nonetheless.Overall though, I totally loved this movie! I would definitely watch it again, and recommend it to big and small kids alike. Also, hang around for the end credits! As a last word, I haven't seen a packed auditorium applaud at the end since Toy Story 3, but they did for this. Watch it, you won't regret it.","['impressed', 'movie', 'visually', 'stun', 'thankfully', 'time', 'gorgeous', 'graphic', 'accompany', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'song', 'clever', 'amuse', 'script', 'story', 'follow', 'two', 'sister', 'elsa', 'anna', 'elsa', 'posse', 'little', 'magic', 'accidentally', 'injures', 'sister', 'game', 'rest', 'movie', 'consequence', 'elsa', 'told', 'troll', 'fear', 'gift', 'keep', 'away', 'everyone', 'else', 'case', 'hurt', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'follow', 'usual', 'princess', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'pattern', 'yes', 'true', 'love', 'different', 'kind', 'fabulous', 'see', 'people', 'comment', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'true', 'love', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'agree', 'mind', 'story', 'really', 'romantic', 'love', 'first', 'tentative', 'kiss', 'right', 'end', 'think', 'begin', 'story', 'meant', 'one', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'love', 'mean', 'different', 'people', 'whether', 'romantic', 'crush', 'love', 'pet', 'companion', 'keep', 'someone', 'safe', 'share', 'problem', 'simply', 'understand', 'also', 'love', 'talented', 'cast', 'lot', 'broadway', 'experience', 'song', 'sound', 'exactly', 'like', 'would', 'expect', 'hear', 'stage', 'musical', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'suit', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'simply', 'stun', 'visually', 'musically', 'idina', 'menzel', 'vocal', 'range', 'extraordinary', 'although', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'underused', 'guy', 'sing', 'aside', 'song', 'brilliant', 'clever', 'catchy', 'ambiguous', 'lyric', 'amuse', 'adult', 'come', 'light', 'relief', 'character', 'sven', 'reindeer', 'cross', 'puppy', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'adorable', 'funny', 'baddie', 'like', 'red', 'herring', 'twist', 'comment', 'address', 'whether', 'baddie', 'evil', 'enough', 'personally', 'like', 'frozen', 'explores', 'vary', 'degree', 'badness', 'contrast', 'type', 'love', 'although', 'nothing', 'bad', 'happens', 'peril', 'pretty', 'mild', 'yet', 'found', 'whole', 'thing', 'grip', 'move', 'often', 'sad', 'felt', 'sorry', 'sister', 'much', 'film', 'happily', 'turn', 'well', 'end', 'niggles', 'stop', 'give', 'star', 'partly', 'groff', 'never', 'sings', 'also', 'plot', 'issue', 'troll', 'play', 'strange', 'little', 'part', 'story', 'discuss', 'extensively', 'thread', 'basically', 'lot', 'problem', 'film', 'essentially', 'fault', 'simple', 'ignore', 'advice', 'magic', 'talk', 'rock', 'none', 'problem', 'sadness', 'need', 'happen', 'listen', 'line', 'lyric', 'get', 'hint', 'maybe', 'cute', 'little', 'rock', 'creature', 'benevolent', 'appear', 'plus', 'manipulative', 'hypocritical', 'official', 'baddie', 'exactly', 'purpose', 'might', 'need', 'watch', 'study', 'troll', 'excuse', 'figure', 'influence', 'also', 'never', 'find', 'elsa', 'manages', 'control', 'power', 'end', 'olaf', 'come', 'life', 'first', 'place', 'happen', 'kristoff', 'parent', 'troll', 'take', 'love', 'kidnapping', 'theory', 'minor', 'niggles', 'nonetheless', 'overall', 'though', 'totally', 'love', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'recommend', 'big', 'small', 'kid', 'alike', 'also', 'hang', 'around', 'end', 'credit', 'last', 'word', 'see', 'packed', 'auditorium', 'applaud', 'end', 'since', 'toy', 'story', 'watch', 'regret']","[947, 1, 585, 315, 1910, 20, 444, 714, 1472, 25, 227, 25, 11, 691, 828, 395, 12, 378, 42, 15, 4, 7, 4, 1215, 48, 150, 300, 1928, 15, 925, 303, 1, 1560, 4, 511, 123, 187, 832, 154, 101, 109, 270, 514, 305, 22, 91, 1, 378, 562, 29, 62, 6, 372, 2062, 325, 62, 6, 140, 193, 2113, 16, 46, 916, 273, 1005, 62, 6, 7, 67, 729, 320, 12, 22, 393, 6, 36, 372, 130, 41, 37, 160, 12, 868, 10, 827, 1, 6, 218, 140, 46, 638, 393, 2481, 6, 983, 2049, 154, 304, 1174, 781, 198, 341, 216, 27, 6, 1356, 227, 84, 411, 334, 11, 259, 522, 9, 26, 131, 568, 1115, 51, 227, 456, 1355, 11, 30, 13, 341, 315, 585, 1769, 141, 116, 821, 958, 1582, 255, 95, 476, 455, 377, 4778, 148, 63, 716, 11, 523, 691, 266, 3142, 475, 828, 147, 40, 735, 297, 8, 181, 151, 1637, 5006, 32, 45, 687, 85, 2533, 9, 1564, 4168, 129, 916, 1595, 638, 2533, 277, 164, 520, 9, 5, 2899, 3798, 1561, 956, 524, 6, 255, 156, 65, 591, 3200, 136, 2497, 182, 231, 127, 43, 2101, 242, 583, 579, 155, 777, 15, 31, 3, 795, 113, 18, 41, 5202, 284, 57, 249, 3847, 377, 88, 794, 27, 52, 519, 123, 204, 980, 48, 94, 12, 3312, 2197, 570, 84, 198, 3, 1668, 1011, 516, 1079, 1369, 150, 178, 834, 679, 198, 1626, 99, 290, 531, 213, 475, 19, 1281, 232, 265, 48, 834, 1334, 3973, 582, 569, 3386, 1812, 2533, 522, 646, 252, 99, 23, 2084, 123, 1229, 630, 1484, 27, 88, 71, 4, 825, 128, 24, 41, 32, 40, 79, 36, 188, 290, 67, 118, 123, 55, 6, 5203, 670, 5202, 1792, 166, 100, 557, 6, 1, 26, 174, 23, 262, 106, 601, 60, 725, 27, 2396, 200, 41, 662, 197, 548, 16, 1184, 5026, 1235, 41, 98, 463, 12, 23, 1900]"
999,8,"For months, I had been hearing that Disney expected this movie to be something very special. Whether that referred to the quality of the entertainment, or the marketability as a product, I wasn't sure, but I hoped for a film that would be moving and timeless, much like the other Hans Christian Anderson adaption in their catalog. The animation is amazing. The detail in the Scandinavian setting is probably my favorite thing about the movie, but the characters are also well designed, some of the most expressive in animation. Anna in particular is a character for the ages. Most of the rest play pretty straightforward roles, but the other standout is Olaf. When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I couldn't understand how such a silly looking, slapstick creation could be part of a movie that was rumored to be a modern classic. I was 100% satisfied with the comic relief he provided. It's so nice to have a character get laughs without any wisecracks or sarcasm. Another thing I really appreciated was that the female lead did not need a man to save her. We learn that Anna needs an act of true love to keep her from freezing solid, but it turns out to be an act of sisterly love. Despite these many strong points, my first impression is that Frozen doesn't rank with the highest tier of Disney classics. Something about the story just felt a little off, and the third act felt rushed. But it is definitely something very special. Also, the music is incredible. Idina Menzel's ""Let It Go"" may be remembered as one of the greatest performances in any animated musical. I look forward to watching again and again over the years.","['month', 'hearing', 'disney', 'expect', 'movie', 'something', 'special', 'whether', 'refer', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'marketability', 'product', 'sure', 'hop', 'film', 'would', 'move', 'timeless', 'much', 'like', 'han', 'christian', 'anderson', 'adaption', 'catalog', 'animation', 'amaze', 'detail', 'scandinavian', 'set', 'probably', 'favorite', 'thing', 'movie', 'character', 'also', 'well', 'design', 'expressive', 'animation', 'anna', 'particular', 'character', 'age', 'rest', 'play', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'role', 'standout', 'olaf', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'movie', 'understand', 'silly', 'look', 'slapstick', 'creation', 'could', 'part', 'movie', 'rumor', 'modern', 'classic', 'satisfied', 'comic', 'relief', 'provide', 'nice', 'character', 'get', 'laugh', 'without', 'wisecrack', 'sarcasm', 'another', 'thing', 'really', 'appreciate', 'female', 'lead', 'need', 'man', 'save', 'learn', 'anna', 'need', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'keep', 'freeze', 'solid', 'turn', 'act', 'sisterly', 'love', 'despite', 'many', 'strong', 'point', 'first', 'impression', 'frozen', 'rank', 'high', 'tier', 'disney', 'classic', 'something', 'story', 'felt', 'little', 'third', 'act', 'felt', 'rush', 'definitely', 'something', 'special', 'also', 'music', 'incredible', 'idina', 'menzel', 'let', 'go', 'may', 'remember', 'one', 'great', 'performance', 'animate', 'musical', 'look', 'forward', 'watch', 'year']","[860, 995, 2, 131, 1, 89, 316, 638, 2064, 283, 839, 1060, 207, 840, 3, 26, 242, 1566, 31, 9, 44, 245, 467, 3119, 3849, 21, 96, 468, 1089, 144, 210, 189, 43, 1, 8, 27, 18, 424, 3793, 21, 7, 650, 8, 139, 303, 204, 136, 1806, 371, 2204, 32, 157, 36, 394, 1, 216, 847, 66, 1751, 1075, 54, 94, 1, 5204, 324, 69, 2251, 309, 297, 458, 192, 8, 19, 190, 137, 3539, 102, 43, 22, 699, 237, 248, 99, 145, 111, 347, 7, 99, 112, 62, 6, 154, 282, 664, 113, 112, 711, 6, 313, 61, 167, 117, 36, 1118, 5, 1468, 206, 3230, 2, 69, 89, 12, 155, 48, 715, 112, 155, 525, 174, 89, 316, 27, 58, 549, 141, 116, 30, 13, 171, 391, 10, 25, 493, 38, 51, 66, 571, 23, 47]"

Along the journey, there are some obstacle that they have to been through together in order to find her sister and stop the town from frozen. At the end of the movie, after all of their adventures, they finally find Elsa and take her back to the town and solved a problem that the town is dealing with cause by Elsa, and finally she ruled the city as a queen. My favorite character is Olaf because the character of Olaf seems friendly and give some to the viewers. When Anna have some problem, Olaf would be always stay beside Anna with goodwill. No matter what happens, Olaf will always be a positive force because he will be taken care of others with a smile on his face. He is very friendly and lovable snowman to the people around him which also make the viewers feel happier. In my opinion, I really like this animation movie because the movie gives me a power of love which is the relationship between two sisters that grew up with inferiority complex but they still beloved by other people around them.

From the beginning of Frozen to the end of let it go, the film is completely on the high level.The technical gap is not so terrible,
In this film, Disney has demonstrated his strong artistic foundation.
All the time to show the top of the classical art atmosphere, ballet + opera + oil painting.
You can only see it at the royal opera house and the national gallery.I used to think that a movie could be called a masterpiece if only one scene could catch up with classic paintings and one scene could catch up with classic scenes of opera. Disney was tough from the start to let it go, and it never fell off that level.
Look at the composition and color, you know that this is a decade of classical oil painting.
The leading role of a bow, a pull skirt, is the bottom of the stage play for ten years.
As soon as the symphonic background music is played, one can tell that he has written opera from the top.The last time my sister came to my sister's rescue, it was something the italians played with five hundred years ago.
Even in the Louvre, there is no loss of color.

It is based on the Hans Christian Andersen classic fairy tale, 'The Snow Queen', and it is a musical-lots of singing here. Kristen plays the younger sister to Idina, who is the next in line to become Queen, after her parents. As a child, Idina learns that she has magical ice powers that are triggered when she becomes emotional-she has an accident that nearly kills her sister, Kristen. When they get older, Idina has another incident that sends the whole kingdom into an eternal winter and decides to go into exile so that she does not do any more harm. Kristen goes after her and in the search, she meets Jonathan, an ice peddler and Josh, a talking snowman-everything talks in a Disney movie. The movie is very focused on the relationship between the two sisters. During the end credits, there is a special disclaimer for something Jonathan says during the movie- it's one of those, 'What he said was his own opinion and not management's"" type of quotes. If you can keep your kids seated during the end credits, there is a scene at the very end-I know, it might be hard to do. I was the only person-including my wife-that saw it in our theater.

1006,4,"Frozen is a deeply conservative Disney animated film that left me unmoved because of its predictable storytelling, obvious metaphors and overt cuteness. If the film had been made decades ago it might have been memorable. This is a project that Disney had struggled with since the 1940s. Danish fairytale writer Hans Christian Anderson has been the source of many Disney films, such as The Little Mermaid, and they have longed to adapt his short story 'The Snow Queen'. It was once intended as a biopic of Anderson himself, with animated sequences, and also became a cancelled Pixar project. John Lassenter, a Pixar heavyweight behind the Toy Story films, was to make the film. He is now a producer of Frozen with Christian Anderson and Jennifer Lee as the film's directors. Lee directed Tangled, a film I enjoyed far more because it took darker and riskier turns in its final quarter. Generally though, the difference between Disney and Pixar's films, including its own princess story Brave, is that Pixar challenge young audiences with difficult ideas and themes. Frozen's recycled notions of love and the endurance of family values seem like a result of the film's chequered development, a safety net employed for box office draw but not artistic success. The film is about the relationship between two princesses who rarely speak to each other anymore. As a child Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) developed a special power that made her freeze things uncontrollably and nearly killed her sister Anna (Kristen Bell). Anna recovered but doesn't know her sister has powers and wonders why she is so detached from her. When Elsa accidentally turns the world into ice, she takes to the mountains to hide herself. Anna is caught between two men: Prince Hans (Santino Fontana), who wants to marry her the first day they meet and Kristoff, a scruffy mountaineer (Jonathan Groff) with a reindeer, who agrees to take her up the mountain to find her sister. The premise contextualises the sisters with contrasting personalities and feelings but does little with them we haven't seen before. The arc of Anna's relationships with the side characters, including a talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad), lack surprises and the film's thematic binaries of fear and love are overly simplistic, even for Disney's young fanbase. These ideas are sometimes pitched at deafening levels by mostly forgettable pop ballads because Frozen also fancies itself as a musical. Disney continues to be etched in conservative values because Walt Disney himself was a Christian, belonging to a Congregationalist Church. ""The important thing is to teach a child that good can always triumph over evil, and that is what our pictures attempt to do,"" he said reflecting on his core principles. Disney is also one of the most recognised brands in history, so what risk is it for them to start telling young audiences about the darker emotions and irresolvable conflicts of the world, as opposed to sugar coated dialogue like ""true love can thaw a frozen heart""? The design of the film is said to be inspired by Norwegian architecture and also Wyoming, a mountain state in the USA. Are the frosty locations a comment on climate change? Aside from the Mickey Mouse short ""Get a Horse!"", which plays before the main feature and makes inventive use of the 3D framing, I found the 3D distracting. A lot of the film's ice palaces and mountain ranges in Frozen are tinted with a dark blue colour palette. Without more vibrant, varied and brighter colour tones, the 3D effects cast a haze over the screen and reduce the amount of light and clarity, particularly in the night scenes. Another jarring aspect of the animation here is that the faces of the characters, particularly the large, round bug eyes and noses, all to look like they've come out of the same computer generated mould. Apparently, it's meant to be a safeguard for political correctness so people aren't offended by having one nationality represented. I wish that Disney in their visual design, their stories and characters had Pixar's courage. Pixar's films are with almost every entry visually unique in the worlds that they create and this imagination filters into the types of stories that they tell. Isn't it time that Disney moved past the power of love and jittery, hyperactive characters? Brave was criticised, mostly unfairly, but it was thematically dark and moving. As a personal preference, I prefer that over a film that is safe and sentimental not only by design but by corporate expectations.","['frozen', 'deeply', 'conservative', 'disney', 'animate', 'film',

Instead of romance being a good thing like in earlier Disney princess films, now it's a bad thing as the one that one of the princesses falls in love with double-crosses her and her sister. Personally, I'm torn on if I like that or not. This film is unusually dark for an animated Disney film. Not a whole lot of comic relief, only about 11 minutes of relief in fact (a.k.a. every Olaf scene). Personally, I didn't mind it being dark, I just found it strange for a Disney film. Personally, I found Elsa, the character we are supposed to be rooting for (and Anna) to be very unsympathetic. Elsa was just a monster, and the way she handled things did not turn my heart towards her. But, compared to how Anna acted, she was sympathetic. Anna was insane. She never allowed anything to stop her, and just kept on going. It was awesome at first, but after a while of her stubbornness, it got tiring. Finally, the music. Sorry, but I hated it. It felt like a lot of the songs were just added in there to fill up some more minutes (I'm looking at you ""Fixer Upper"" and ""Frozen Heart"") and others were just unnecessary (The one that Olaf sings. While cute and funny, I didn't think it was needed). And then, ""Let It Go"" which is awesome at first, and then you hear it everywhere and it gets stuck in your head. Overall, I thought it was a decent film. Good story, but Anna's stubbornness, lame soundtrack, Elsa being a complete rip-off of Jack Frost from ""Rise of the Guardians"" and it being a bit of a dark film with little comic relief really made the quality go down. I give it a 4.5 out of 10.","['first', 'saw', 'film', 'absolutely', 'loathe', 'much', 'still', 'find', 'great', 'film', 'decent', 'disney', 'princess', 'film', 'like', 'probably', 'know', 'different', 'type', 'disney', 'princess', 'film', 'cinderella', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'instead', 'romance', 'good', 'thing', 'like', 'earlier', 'disney', 'princess', 'film', 'bad', 'thing', 'one', 'one', 'princess', 'fall', 'love', 'double', 'cross', 'sister', 'personally', 'torn', 'like', 'film', 'unusually', 'dark', 'animate', 'disney', 'film', 'whole', 'lot', 'comic', 'relief', 'minute', 'relief', 'fact', 'k', 'every', 'olaf', 'scene', 'personally', 'mind', 'dark', 'found', 'strange', 'disney', 'film', 'personally', 'found', 'elsa', 'character', 'suppose', 'root', 'anna', 'unsympathetic', 'elsa', 'monster', 'way', 'handle', 'thing', 'turn', 'heart', 'towards', 'compare', 'anna', 'act', 'sympathetic', 'anna', 'insane', 'never', 'allow', 'anything', 'stop', 'kept', 'go', 'awesome', 'first', 'stubbornness', 'get', 'tire', 'finally', 'music', 'sorry', 'hat', 'felt', 'like', 'lot', 'song', 'add', 'fill', 'minute', 'look', 'fixer', 'upper', 'frozen', 'heart', 'others', 'unnecessary', 'one', 'olaf', 'sings', 'cute', 'funny', 'think', 'need', 'let', 'go', 'awesome', 'first', 'hear', 'everywhere', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', 'overall', 'thought', 'decent', 'film', 'good', 'story', 'anna', 'stubbornness', 'lame', 'soundtrack', 'elsa', 'complete', 'rip', 'jack', 'frost', 'rise', 'guardian', 'bit', 'dark', 'film', 'little', 'comic', 'relief', 'really', 'make', 'quality', 'go', 'give']","[36, 157, 3, 292, 2635, 31, 68, 71, 25, 3, 546, 2, 29, 3, 9, 210, 56, 140, 524, 2, 29, 3, 854, 1090, 149, 208, 363, 17, 43, 9, 846, 2, 29, 3, 65, 43, 10, 10, 29, 186, 6, 2177, 1637, 15, 520, 3719, 9, 3, 3842, 628, 38, 2, 3, 127, 84, 309, 297, 211, 297, 201, 2068, 115, 32, 90, 520, 320, 628, 231, 980, 2, 3, 520, 231, 4, 8, 473, 885, 7, 4, 495, 50, 1036, 43, 113, 80, 538, 350, 7, 112, 1616, 7, 2316, 88, 833, 212, 284, 498, 13, 338, 36, 3950, 19, 1086, 241, 58, 777, 606, 155, 9, 84, 11, 269, 481, 211, 66, 772, 737, 5, 80, 247, 845, 10, 32, 794, 265, 85, 37, 99, 30, 13, 338, 36, 568, 879, 19, 954, 317, 166, 92, 546, 3, 17, 12, 7, 3950, 1344, 225, 4, 656, 1580, 2103, 1686, 880, 1768, 95, 628, 3, 48, 309, 297, 22, 14, 283, 13, 57]"

1009,10,"As in almost all of their shows, Disney uses an already existent story/tale and creates a new completely different one, in which moral and love should predominate against the evil. Frozen is an enchanting story of two sisters that adore each other, but they get separated due to the fears of the older sister Elsa (in the voice of Idina Menzel), who in her crowning, with her magic powers out of control, ends up hurting her young sister Anna (in the voice of Kristen Bell) and put a curse at the kingdom of Arendell. When Anna decides to look for her sister, both start to discover who they really are, so they leave their fears behind. It is an incredible story of overcoming fear through love. However, it is not a simple kind of love. The animation becomes even more captivating principally by the fact that this fairy tale is not based at a man and woman feeling but rather at the fraternal love between the two characters. Disney showed with this incredible animation the importance of family, and that not always a true love's kiss so strong as a bravery act of true love. The Danish fairy tale which Frozen is slightly based, ""The Snow Queen"" by Christian Andersen, has a darker story, and without an apparent moral; after all, the bad queen stays bad, and the characters, although nice, are not nearly as charismatic as the Frozen sisters. The whole work is enchanting , and the songs that permeate the scenes are funny and fit to the situations, making the soundtrack a striking part of the work. The most significant element is the song ""Let It Go"" that is simply lovely. And the visual effects are really well done and spectacular. The movie is so enthralling that it has already achieved the highest box office record of Disney, profiting until the moment more than USD 317 millions, surpassing ""The Lion King"" which obtained a total of USD 312 millions in their box office.

1011,10,"I'll say as simple as I can, Frozen is amazing. I'm a big Disney fan, I love Dumbo, Aladdin, Hercules, etc, And I missed the Disney magic I grew up. Wreck-It Ralph, Bolt and more recent films didn't satisfied me, I believe Disney's future would depend on Marvel and Pixar. Watching Frozen's first trailer (the one with Olaf and Sven) didn't get my attention and after i knew It would be a princess film i planned to avoid watching it, I never was so wrong. Frozen takes everything we love from Disney classics. The story is awesome, original and unique, because it's full of surprises, action, fun and, the most important, it doesn't have the common princess cliché of a happy end with the perfect prince. The story also has remarkable messages further than only love, it's about confidence, sistership, sacrifice and accepting yourself. The songs can't be defined with words, they're all incredible and memorable, they're like the Lion King's. If someday i become father i'll talked them about these songs for they're so good from beginning to end that i can't take them out of my head. ""Let it go"" deserves the Oscar and Golden Globe. The characters has no precedents, they're outstanding: anna, a smart, strong, funny, beautiful, flawed, human princess, different from any other; Olaf is both funny and adorable; Kristoff is not the handsome, rich and loving prince Disney always includes in that kind of films; the villain, i don't want to spoil a lot so i'm not telling who is him, is like Scar from the Lion King, he's not powerful or strong, he's smart and persuasive; and Elsa, the most complicated and interesting character of Disney, even more complicated than the Beast (beauty and the Beast) 'cause she lives isolated in a big house with servants and her curse affects people around her too, but unlike the Beast Elsa's cursed since her birth and she has no idea how to stop the curse, but she's kind, good and innocent, that's why she is my favorite. This my favorite film of the year, although i watched remarkable films like the hobbit 2, gravity and monsters university, because i consider Frozen as a miracle for Disney; the day i watched it i was depressed because of personal reasons, but this film cheer me up. I can't stop thinking about Frozen, it made me feel like a child again! I'm almost an 18 year male and i love this film. Disney is back.

Take a minute to try to think of her positive traits. I'll wait... other than that she loves her sister enough to come save her (though not enough to have talked to her much in the last decade or so). Then there's their proportions. Just like barbie before them, if any human had proportions like these two they would need immediate medical care. No one is shaped like that. From their bug eyes that take up all their triangularly pointed faces, to their tiny waists. It's unnatural. If you want a positive role model, look to Mulan or Hermione or Emilia Earhart or Marie Curie. Cleopatra even! But not some deformed, emotionally unstable damsels in distress.

1014,6,"Not a wussy lame movie but an adventurous and enjoyable movie, Frozen is perfect for families, being sweet, funny, and overall fun, making its way to the first slot in the box office. Loosely based on the fairytale The Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen, Frozen is not the typical Disney princess movie, for although true love does save the princess, true love is definitely not brought on by who most people would believe. The plot may seem familiar but there are some creative twists in the storyline. Deception and corruption are two elements that have broken through the Disney- clean movies, as displayed in Frozen.Elsa--played by Idina Menzel (Rachel's mom from Glee)--was a celebrated and cherished queen. However, she has been keeping a secret for a long time, and when the people find out on her coronation day, they turn against her, and she runs away in fear and desperation. Her sister, Anna--played by Kristen Bell--is always being shut out by Elsa, not knowing that Elsa was trying to protect by shunning her. However, Anna's sisterly love never dims, so she set out to find and bring her sister back. Anna had to make the decision to entrust the kingdom to Hans, a man she just met that day and believes is her true love. During her ambitious journey, she joins forces with a mountain man, Kristoff and his reindeer, Sven, and later a comedic and innocently cheerful snowman, Olaf.Elsa plays the typical queen-who-needs-to-complete-her-duty, while Anna plays an optimist with a real, relatable personality that makes her totally likable. Since the movie takes place in the dead of winter and the weather outside is so cold, you can almost feel the freezing weather chill you, yet the love and comedy will warm your heart. This movie has lots of catchy and melodious songs for you to download, including ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"", ""For the First Time in Forever"", and ""Let it Go"", and they don't get tiring. This movie even teaches a lesson: don't trust strangers! Disney seems to have resurrected its old spirit, such as with the classic Disney princess movies, with some new modern twists, adding on personality and charisma. I'm thinking of a Broadway musical!","['wussy', 'lame', 'movie', 'adventurous', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'frozen', 'perfect', 'family', 'sweet', 'funny', 'overall', 'fun', 'make', 'way', 'first', 'slot', 'box', 'office', 'loosely', 'base', 'fairytale', 'snow', 'queen', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'frozen', 'typical', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'although', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'princess', 'true', 'love', 'definitely', 'brought', 'people', 'would', 'believe', 'plot', 'may', 'seem', 'familiar', 'creative', 'twist', 'storyline', 'deception', 'corruption', 'two', 'element', 'broken', 'disney', 'clean', 'movie', 'displayed', 'frozen', 'elsa', 'played', 'idina', 'menzel', 'rachel', 'mom', 'glee', 'celebrate', 'cherished', 'queen', 'however', 'keep', 'secret', 'long', 'time', 'people', 'find', 'coronation', 'day', 'turn', 'run', 'away', 'fear', 'desperation', 'sister', 'anna', 'played', 'kristen', 'bell', 'always', 'shut', 'elsa', 'know', 'elsa', 'try', 'protect', 'shun', 'however', 'anna', 'sisterly', 'love', 'never', 'dims', 'set', 'find', 'bring', 'sister', 'back', 'anna', 'make', 'decision', 'entrust', 'kingdom', 'han', 'man', 'met', 'day', 'believe', 'true', 'love', 'ambitious', 'journey', 'join', 'force', 'mountain', 'man', 'kristoff', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'later', 'comedic', 'innocently', 'cheerful', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'elsa', 'play', 'typical', 'queen', 'need', 'complete', 'duty', 'anna', 'play', 'optimist', 'real', 'relatable', 'personality', 'make', 'totally', 'likable', 'since', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'dead', 'winter', 'weather', 'outside', 'cold', 'almost', 'feel', 'freeze', 'weather', 'chill', 'yet', 'love', 'comedy', 'warm', 'heart', 'movie', 'lot', 'catchy', 'melodious', 'song', 'download', 'include', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'let', 'go', 'get', 'tire', 'movie', 'even', 'teach', 'lesson', 'trust', 'stranger', 'disney', 'seem', 'resurrect', 'old', 'spirit', 'classic', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'new', 'modern', 'twist', 'add', 'personality', 'charisma', 'think', 'broadway', 'musical']","[1344, 1, 1710, 306, 1, 5, 175, 72, 457, 85, 166, 125, 14, 50, 36, 3993, 598, 717, 696, 256, 756, 39, 49, 44, 245, 339, 5, 376, 2, 29, 1, 255, 62, 6, 111, 29, 62, 6, 174, 599, 46, 26, 220, 52, 171, 75, 1077, 1014, 129, 295, 3511, 42, 401, 1245, 2, 2755, 1, 4983, 5, 4, 507, 141, 116, 1109, 1548, 1728, 3272, 49, 110, 154, 508, 169, 20, 46, 71, 343, 138, 113, 233, 101, 187, 15, 7, 507, 162, 146, 163, 686, 4, 56, 4, 87, 513, 3710, 110, 7, 711, 6, 88, 144, 71, 221, 15, 74, 7, 14, 758, 77, 44, 145, 392, 138, 220, 62, 6, 2028, 337, 813, 272, 214, 145, 67, 151, 181, 358, 1043, 1638, 45, 32, 4, 204, 376, 49, 99, 656, 2857, 7, 204, 2019, 195, 884, 407, 14, 557, 402, 98, 1, 55, 188, 831, 105, 986, 769, 366, 173, 53, 282, 986, 1117, 182, 6, 279, 362, 80, 1, 84, 266, 2725, 11, 2030, 349, 59, 202, 45, 36, 20, 287, 30, 13, 19, 1086, 1, 28, 621, 499, 836, 1249, 2, 75, 3982, 64, 767, 69, 2, 29, 1, 108, 324, 129, 269, 407, 2382, 37, 411, 51]"
1015,10,"I love this movie, I never get tired of it. the warmest story I've ever seen, Elsa and Anna were my favorite. One of the best things it's that this is not the classical story about a princess and the prince, it's about true love, family and friendship.warning it can contain spoilers: When people speak of their favorite Disney movies, the big four of the Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion. The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant. Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation. FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.","['love', 'movie', 'never', 'get', 'tire', 'warm', 'story', 'ever', 'see', 'elsa', 'anna', 'favorite', 'one', 'best', 'thing', 'classical', 'story', 'princess', 'prince', 'true', 'love', 'family', 'friendship', 'warn', 'contain', 'spoiler', 'people', 'speak', 'favorite', 'disney', 'movie', 'big', 'four', 'renaissance', 'film', 'golden', 'age', 'animation', 'likely', 'mention', 'past', 'decade', 'see', 'disney', 'movie', 'hit', 'miss', 'consider', 'classic', 'forgotten', 'close', 'classic', 'yet', 'frozen', 'change', 'dynamic', 'creates', 'full', 'fledge', 'classic', 'frozen', 'classic', 'disney', 'classic', 'decade', 'could', 'position', 'best', 'disney', 'return', 'root', 'vengeance', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'past', 'year', 'opinion', 'story', 'heart', 'melt', 'fill', 'pure', 'feel', 'heart', 'become', 'staple', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'move', 'story', 'family', 'center', 'unpretentious', 'try', 'portray', 'comedy', 'hit', 'right', 'mark', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'thrill', 'journey', 'make', 'tale', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'exact', 'right', 'amount', 'dare', 'movie', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moment', 'stun', 'provoke', 'others', 'achieve', 'balance', 'true', 'triumph', 'story', 'tell', 'prof', 'exactly', 'disney', 'best', 'prove', 'back', 'produce', 'top', 'quality', 'film', 'affect', 'human', 'story', 'one', 'significant', 'startle', 'stun', 'beautifully', 'envision', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'relevant', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'stun', 'backdrop', 'intricacy', 'like', 'never', 'see', 'environment', 'costume', 'character', 'movement', 'among', 'thing', 'make', 'film', 'gigantic', 'step', 'forward', 'brilliant', 'voice', 'talent', 'breath', 'life', 'project', 'need', 'applaud', 'cast', 'consist', 'kristen', 'bell', 'veronica', 'mar', 'idina', 'menzel', 'wicked', 'among', 'many', 'others', 'bring', 'win', 'charm', 'superior', 'voice', 'act', 'magnificent', 'vocal', 'well', 'heart', 'tale', 'sensational', 'wit', 'humor', 'array', 'different', 'personality', 'emotion', 'triumph', 'fall', 'make', 'interest', 'character', 'people', 'relate', 'best', 'see', 'animation', 'cast', 'fully', 'become', 'character', 'score', 'music', 'perfect', 'score', 'grand', 'sound', 'texture', 'harmony', 'melody', 'class', 'beyond', 'anything', 'attempt', 'animation', 'studio', 'past', 'decade', 'would', 'place', 'song', 'movie', 'enchant', 'true', 'round', 'musical', 'triumph', 'song', 'stuck', 'mind', 'hum', 'even', 'know', 'belting', 'top', 'lung', 'good', 'song', 'progress', 'story', 'essential', 'part', 'meticulously', 'craft', 'breath', 'take', 'animation', 'affect', 'tale', 'bond', 'family', 'romance', 'hilarious', 'wit', 'humor', 'courtesy', 'character', 'especially', 'sweet', 'olaf', 'heart', 'stop', 'adventure', 'true', 'fairy', 'tale', 'would', 'say', 'could', 'well', 'little', 'mermaid', 'beauty', 'beast', 'generation', 'frozen', 'disney', 'magic', 'miss', 'long', 'come', 'full', 'force']","[6, 1, 88, 19, 1086, 362, 12, 81, 16, 4, 7, 189, 10, 34, 43, 1803, 12, 29, 82, 62, 6, 72, 1003, 1228, 1562, 419, 46, 641, 189, 2, 1, 106, 784, 465, 3, 796, 139, 21, 1016, 348, 276, 492, 16, 2, 1, 234, 271, 421, 69, 1017, 351, 69, 182, 5, 209, 988, 797, 246, 2297, 69, 5, 69, 2, 69, 492, 54, 1391, 34, 2, 385, 885, 2554, 34, 38, 3, 276, 47, 258, 12, 80, 359, 481, 724, 53, 80, 179, 1704, 34, 2, 1, 242, 12, 72, 649, 2298, 87, 1018, 279, 234, 130, 820, 345, 1184, 326, 1019, 337, 14, 114, 48, 95, 132, 1392, 130, 624, 1110, 1, 190, 798, 133, 315, 1607, 247, 1531, 677, 62, 989, 12, 143, 909, 522, 2, 34, 799, 74, 587, 239, 283, 3, 1076, 515, 12, 10, 1705, 2299, 315, 529, 2104, 910, 439, 1335, 444, 267, 315, 1821, 1947, 9, 88, 16, 1147, 1336, 8, 886, 471, 43, 14, 3, 2105, 668, 571, 523, 86, 800, 990, 79, 1020, 99, 1235, 227, 2106, 162, 146, 1532, 1533, 141, 116, 678, 471, 61, 247, 221, 374, 235, 1185, 86, 112, 935, 821, 18, 80, 114, 1948, 1455, 222, 2107, 140, 407, 240, 989, 186, 14, 122, 8, 46, 785, 34, 16, 21, 227, 822, 179, 8, 223, 58, 175, 223, 936, 259, 1148, 1608, 1186, 1283, 614, 212, 448, 21, 311, 276, 492, 26, 188, 11, 1, 615, 62, 911, 51, 989, 11, 954, 320, 1048, 28, 56, 1949, 239, 2108, 17, 11, 1149, 12, 1337, 94, 2555, 1021, 990, 55, 21, 1076, 114, 482, 72, 363, 364, 1455, 222, 2300, 8, 121, 457, 32, 80, 284, 326, 62, 219, 114, 26, 35, 54, 18, 48, 422, 149, 203, 616, 5, 2, 150, 271, 169, 40, 246, 272]"

I am sure many people already know that by now from listening to so many other people, young and old, sing the songs. The theater was filled up with people of all ages. The storyline was also great and did in some ways remind me of Tangled, That was awesome for us since I was with my girl and this is a movie about princesses. So, Disney just has a way of developing these movies so excellently by putting together the voices, drawing, storyline, high definition and music that you totally forget that you are even watching a cartoon.

1017,7,"I'm writing a review because I discussed this movie with a friend of mine last night who claimed this movie was very feminist. So here's why I disagree: Its not empowering women to encourage young girls to have role models which have literally no concept of hard work and only one of innate gifts or birth rights? Sorry to say but its unrealistic some palace raised rich girl is able to save a guy whose lived in the wild all his life 3-4 times within the first 5 minutes of encountering him, if you want to get rid of the damsel in distress trope, make a damsel that has worked hard to get to where she is. If you want a good role model as a female protagonist character in a cartoon movie, one of self sacrifice, heroism and hard work, try Mulan.Other things about the movie: I like the songs in this movie, though they seem few in number(because the majority of them are in the first half hour). If the above complaint is fixed(aka, make good characters) I feel like we could go back to a Disney classics era with this direction. There are a few witty moments and fun memes(like the snowman wanting to enjoy summer).Plot: A good plot in most movies is mainly about the emotional impact and the unpredictability of events unfolding.The songs help pull you into the plot but after the 35 minute mark the songs are fewer in number and the story lacks any moments with real impact. The ending feels very artificial with some very odd coincidences(like turning into ice the same second you are hit by a blade) and placements.The story is mostly predictable with the exception of the prince being evil which was a cool twist(since it isn't the first time a totally bland prince ends up as the romance interest).Overall: Even though I have my share of complaints, I quite enjoyed the movie overall so I recommend it.","['write', 'review', 'discuss', 'movie', 'friend', 'mine', 'last', 'night', 'claimed', 'movie', 'feminist', 'disagree', 'empower', 'woman', 'encourage', 'young', 'girl', 'role', 'model', 'literally', 'concept', 'hard', 'work', 'one', 'innate', 'gift', 'birth', 'right', 'sorry', 'say', 'unrealistic', 'palace', 'raise', 'rich', 'girl', 'able', 'save', 'guy', 'whose', 'live', 'wild', 'life', 'time', 'within', 'first', 'minute', 'encounter', 'want', 'get', 'rid', 'damsel', 'distress', 'trope', 'make', 'damsel', 'work', 'hard', 'get', 'want', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'female', 'protagonist', 'character', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'one', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'heroism', 'hard', 'work', 'try', 'mulan', 'thing', 'movie', 'like', 'song', 'movie', 'though', 'seem', 'number', 'majority', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'complaint', 'fix', 'aka', 'make', 'good', 'character', 'feel', 'like', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'disney', 'classic', 'era', 'direction', 'witty', 'moment', 'fun', 'meme', 'like', 'snowman', 'want', 'enjoy', 'summer', 'plot', 'good', 'plot', 'movie', 'mainly', 'emotional', 'impact', 'unpredictability', 'event', 'unfold', 'song', 'help', 'pull', 'plot', 'minute', 'mark', 'song', 'number', 'story', 'lack', 'moment', 'real', 'impact', 'end', 'feel', 'artificial', 'odd', 'coincidence', 'like', 'turn', 'ice', 'second', 'hit', 'blade', 'placement', 'story', 'mostly', 'predictable', 'exception', 'prince', 'evil', 'cool', 'twist', 'since', 'first', 'time', 'totally', 'bland', 'prince', 'end', 'romance', 'interest', 'overall', 'even', 'though', 'share', 'complaint', 'quite', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'overall', 'recommend']","[165, 161, 3312, 1, 327, 2514, 197, 773, 2399, 1, 720, 2109, 1852, 251, 1657, 73, 76, 371, 753, 643, 693, 307, 107, 10, 4742, 832, 2546, 130, 777, 35, 2281, 383, 760, 1613, 76, 294, 111, 148, 620, 224, 2410, 79, 20, 654, 36, 211, 951, 59, 19, 3953, 1492, 1563, 1032, 14, 1492, 107, 307, 19, 59, 17, 371, 753, 237, 354, 8, 314, 1, 10, 429, 635, 5166, 307, 107, 87, 931, 43, 1, 9, 11, 1, 100, 75, 184, 1163, 36, 346, 487, 897, 1012, 2854, 14, 17, 8, 53, 9, 54, 13, 74, 2, 69, 942, 754, 1216, 133, 125, 3808, 9, 45, 59, 91, 205, 52, 17, 52, 1, 934, 342, 1153, 618, 3647, 11, 135, 695, 52, 211, 820, 11, 184, 12, 273, 133, 195, 1153, 41, 53, 3055, 1258, 3943, 9, 113, 33, 319, 234, 4064, 2694, 12, 567, 331, 645, 82, 277, 556, 129, 98, 36, 20, 557, 811, 82, 41, 363, 122, 166, 28, 100, 781, 897, 124, 91, 1, 166, 262]"
1018,6,"Frozen, Disney's Oscar-Winning 2013 animated film, is a fun, family adventure, with lots of laughs, and sing-along fun.Elsa and Anna, two sisters who were inseparable when they were children, Anna, a normal enough child, whilst Elsa was born with the power to control snow and ice. But, after an accident when they were children, and Anna had to forget about Elsa's powers, she was forced to shut Anna and everyone out in order to protect them. Several years later, at Elsa's coronation, Anna gets engaged to someone she believed to be her true love, but, unfortunately, Elsa had mixed feelings about it, and accidentally lets loose her powers, and freezes the Kingdom of Arendelle as she flees for the Kingdom. Anna must team up with Kristoff, a stubborn man who sells ice for a living, his reindeer Sven, and a talking snowman Olaf in order to bring summer back to Arendelle.I must say, this is a very pretty film, with the special effects they have done, especially in the 'Let It Go' sequence when Elsa builds her ice castle, and creates her ice dress. Viewers can tell the amount of attention to detail that has been done to create this movie, from the animation itself, to the casting of the characters. Each casted actor/actress fitted their designated character perfectly, both when needed to sing, or just talk. Olaf is the character in the film that makes the most jokes, and is also loving and caring, and dreams of when summer will one day come... But, this film was created by the people that also created 'Brave', 'Wreck-It-Ralph', and 'Tangled', and there are easter eggs between those films. When Anna is singing 'For The First Time In Forever' and she goes out the gates, if you look carefully you can see Rapunzel and Eugene! The 'Wreck-It-Ralph' reference, is that when Anna says ""I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face"", in the same song, the chocolate is from 'Wreck-It-Ralph'! The Brave reference, is that Merida's mum, Eleanor, has a white strand of hair, just like Anna!Christopher Becke has created the soundtrack from the film, and has created good songs that go well with each scene in the film, and suite the mood and atmosphere very well, especially at crucial moments.This film has got stunning voice talent, witty humour, and an amazing storyline, that will want the audience wanting more... If they like singing that it.In the film, I believe that the space between some of the songs were too short, as it was only about 5 minutes after 'For The First Time In Forever' and 'Let It Go' was then playing. Also, this film is more for younger audiences, and can get quite boring at times, so, I do think it is overrated slightly, though, it's still a good film to watch.Overall, I award this film 6/10 stars, as it was fun to watch, but the songs childish target audience, and childish jokes got boring quickly, and, knowing Disney, they're going to milk that thing dry for the money.","['frozen', 'disney', 'oscar', 'win', 'animate', 'film', 'fun', 'family', 'adventure', 'lot', 'laugh', 'sing', 'along', 'fun', 'elsa', 'anna', 'two', 'sister', 'inseparable', 'child', 'anna', 'normal', 'enough', 'child', 'whilst', 'elsa', 'born', 'power', 'control', 'snow', 'ice', 'accident', 'child', 'anna', 'forget', 'elsa', 'power', 'force', 'shut', 'anna', 'everyone', 'order', 'protect', 'several', 'year', 'later', 'elsa', 'coronation', 'anna', 'get', 'engage', 'someone', 'believe', 'true', 'love', 'unfortunately', 'elsa', 'mixed', 'feeling', 'accidentally', 'let', 'loose', 'power', 'freeze', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'flees', 'kingdom', 'anna', 'must', 'team', 'kristoff', 'stubborn', 'man', 'sell', 'ice', 'living', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'talk', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'order', 'bring', 'summer', 'back', 'arendelle', 'must', 'say', 'pretty', 'film', 'special', 'effect', 'especially', 'let', 'go', 'sequence', 'elsa', 'build', 'ice', 'castle', 'creates', 'ice', 'dress', 'viewer', 'tell', 'amount', 'attention', 'detail', 'create', 'movie', 'animation', 'cast', 'character', 'cast', 'actor', 'actress', 'fit', 'designate', 'character', 'perfectly', 'need', 'sing', 'talk', 'olaf', 'character', 'film', 'make', 'joke', 'also', 'love', 'care', 'dream', 'summer', 'one', 'day', 'come', 'film', 'create', 'people', 'also', 'create', 'brave', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'tangle', 'easter', 'egg', 'film', 'anna', 'sing', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'go', 'gate', 'look', 'carefully', 'see', 'rapunzel', 'eugene', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'reference', 'anna', 'say', 'wan', 'stuff', 'chocolate', 'face', 'song', 'chocolate', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'brave', 'reference', 'merida', 'mum', 'eleanor', 'white', 'strand', 'hair', 'like', 'anna', 'christopher', 'becke', 'create', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'create', 'good', 'song', 'go', 'well', 'scene', 'film', 'suite', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'well', 'especially', 'crucial', 'moment', 'film', 'get', 'stun', 'voice', 'talent', 'witty', 'humour', 'amaze', 'storyline', 'want', 'audience', 'want', 'like', 'sing', 'film', 'believe', 'space', 'song', 'short', 'minute', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'let', 'go', 'play', 'also', 'film', 'young', 'audience', 'get', 'quite', 'boring', 'time', 'think', 'overrate', 'slightly', 'though', 'still', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'overall', 'award', 'film', 'star', 'fun', 'watch', 'song', 'childish', 'target', 'audience', 'childish', 'joke', 'get', 'boring', 'quickly', 'know', 'disney', 'go', 'milk', 'thing', 'dry', 'money']","[5, 2, 302, 374, 38, 3, 125, 72, 326, 84, 190, 63, 172, 125, 4, 7, 42, 15, 70, 7, 873, 164, 70, 1130, 4, 589, 24, 128, 39, 33, 480, 70, 7, 746, 4, 24, 272, 686, 7, 109, 496, 513, 608, 47, 358, 4, 343, 7, 19, 619, 304, 220, 62, 6, 573, 4, 1082, 680, 300, 30, 937, 24, 282, 77, 199, 710, 77, 7, 236, 486, 67, 2751, 145, 718, 33, 704, 151, 181, 178, 45, 32, 496, 221, 205, 74, 199, 236, 35, 136, 3, 316, 278, 121, 30, 13, 502, 4, 202, 33, 168, 797, 33, 907, 479, 143, 624, 541, 468, 134, 1, 21, 227, 8, 227, 518, 1495, 560, 8, 456, 99, 63, 178, 32, 8, 3, 14, 451, 27, 6, 293, 626, 205, 10, 138, 40, 3, 134, 46, 27, 134, 335, 352, 379, 83, 2582, 2932, 3, 7, 63, 36, 20, 287, 13, 964, 66, 2454, 16, 527, 3976, 352, 379, 1246, 7, 35, 779, 698, 1779, 381, 11, 1779, 352, 379, 335, 1246, 3216, 2362, 3956, 365, 3013, 844, 9, 7, 3975, 134, 225, 3, 134, 17, 11, 13, 18, 90, 3, 1084, 1380, 18, 121, 3249, 133, 3, 19, 315, 86, 800, 1216, 732, 96, 295, 59, 159, 59, 9, 63, 3, 220, 1628, 11, 263, 211, 36, 20, 287, 30, 13, 204, 27, 3, 73, 159, 19, 124, 370, 20, 37, 426, 774, 100, 68, 17, 3, 23, 166, 469, 3, 249, 125, 23, 11, 1156, 1037, 159, 1156, 451, 19, 370, 733, 56, 2, 13, 43, 3966, 661]"

Is it perfect? No. Does it deserve 10 stars no. Does it deserve 1 star no. It is a solid 8 star movie. It has a good storyline with fun characters. Oh and I do not see the anti-male thing; just because something is pro-female does not make it anti-male. and pro-gay? I don't see that either. People who bring their own crap into movies are going to see what they want to see. This was a movie about a girl living in fear and about sisterly love. I liked how it wasn't about a dude saving the day; but that is just me and maybe that is why some people say it is anti-male because if a dude is not there to save the day what use is the male species anyway? Oh and the other a dude is a villain as well so there is that. Plus a butt load of songs. This is Disney....and good Disney. Not a 10 but not a 1 either.

All in all , this movie is the best movie , and personally , i think it is even better than the Disney's big legend #Thelionking , and now my #Frozen is my current favorite movie after #Abeautifulmind , i think this movie deserves 8.90/10 You have outdone yourself this time Disney , well doneZakaria RAHMOUNI","['movie', 'cold', 'winter', 'aspect', 'summer', 'course', 'atmosphere', 'character', 'design', 'professionally', 'make', 'character', 'appropriate', 'everyone', 'suit', 'position', 'story', 'movie', 'thesnowqueen', 'k', 'frozen', 'bit', 'feminist', 'show', 'love', 'woman', 'build', 'man', 'weaker', 'family', 'love', 'exactly', 'make', 'movie', 'big', 'hit', 'billion', 'dollar', 'globe', 'two', 'oscar', 'sing', 'animation', 'point', 'animation', 'frozen', 'obtains', 'next', 'gen', 'animation', 'quality', 'breathtaking', 'mouvements', 'extraordinary', 'fluid', 'smooth', 'contains', 'much', 'detail', 'make', 'fabulous', 'mouvements', 'sven', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'olaf', 'mouvements', 'elsa', 'make', 'probably', 'guy', 'go', 'crazy', 'sing', 'good', 'frozen', 'many', 'song', 'favorite', 'let', 'go', 'perform', 'idina', 'menzel', 'movie', 'best', 'movie', 'personally', 'think', 'even', 'well', 'disney', 'big', 'legend', 'thelionking', 'frozen', 'current', 'favorite', 'movie', 'abeautifulmind', 'think', 'movie', 'deserves', 'outdone', 'time', 'disney', 'well', 'donezakaria', 'rahmouni']","[1, 366, 105, 443, 205, 228, 1380, 8, 424, 3695, 14, 8, 1742, 109, 1355, 1391, 12, 1, 2068, 5, 95, 720, 78, 6, 251, 202, 145, 2413, 72, 6, 522, 14, 1, 106, 234, 1159, 1446, 1521, 42, 302, 63, 21, 117, 21, 5, 418, 21, 283, 905, 3994, 1582, 3128, 1878, 1054, 31, 468, 14, 2113, 3994, 181, 7, 67, 32, 3994, 4, 14, 210, 148, 13, 1008, 63, 17, 5, 61, 11, 189, 30, 13, 1332, 141, 116, 1, 34, 1, 520, 37, 28, 18, 2, 106, 2623, 5, 1481, 189, 1, 37, 1, 592, 5217, 20, 2, 18]"
1023,10,"Frozen is an animated movie about a girl named Elsa who has ice powers. She was always able to control her powers, until one day she accidentally attacked her sister Anna. She could feel her powers getting stronger, so she got someone to erase Anna's memory of Elsa having any ice powers. The castle they lived in was locked up for a really long time, and when they opened it, everyone found about Elsa's ice powers and her secret was revealed. She ran away and her sister Anna, Olaf, and Kristoff went on a journey to find her and bring her back. The movie Frozen was awesome. It was a Disney movie so I expected it to be really similar where there is a prince who saves the princess. But this movie was different, it added a change. The main characters in this movie are Anna (Kristen Bell), Elsa( Idina Menzel), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), and Olaf (Josh Gad). This movie has amazing songs which are really catchy and will stay stuck in your head for. Frozen is also suitable for all ages and you can enjoy it with your whole family.Overall, I loved Frozen! It's such a good movie, and it's really funny. The songs are amazing, and the plot isn't cheesy like most other Disney movies.","['frozen', 'animate', 'movie', 'girl', 'name', 'elsa', 'ice', 'power', 'always', 'able', 'control', 'power', 'one', 'day', 'accidentally', 'attack', 'sister', 'anna', 'could', 'feel', 'power', 'get', 'strong', 'get', 'someone', 'erase', 'anna', 'memory', 'elsa', 'ice', 'power', 'castle', 'live', 'lock', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'open', 'everyone', 'found', 'elsa', 'ice', 'power', 'secret', 'reveal', 'ran', 'away', 'sister', 'anna', 'olaf', 'kristoff', 'go', 'journey', 'find', 'bring', 'back', 'movie', 'frozen', 'awesome', 'disney', 'movie', 'expect', 'really', 'similar', 'prince', 'save', 'princess', 'movie', 'different', 'add', 'change', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'olaf', 'josh', 'gad', 'movie', 'amaze', 'song', 'really', 'catchy', 'stay', 'stuck', 'head', 'frozen', 'also', 'suitable', 'age', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'family', 'overall', 'love', 'frozen', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'funny', 'song', 'amaze', 'plot', 'cheesy', 'like', 'disney', 'movie']","[5, 38, 1, 76, 183, 4, 33, 24, 163, 294, 128, 24, 10, 138, 300, 1931, 15, 7, 54, 53, 24, 19, 167, 19, 304, 972, 7, 412, 4, 33, 24, 168, 224, 382, 22, 169, 20, 318, 109, 231, 4, 33, 24, 508, 528, 1476, 101, 15, 7, 32, 67, 13, 337, 71, 221, 74, 1, 5, 338, 2, 1, 131, 22, 446, 82, 111, 29, 1, 140, 269, 209, 119, 8, 1, 7, 162, 146, 4, 141, 116, 67, 455, 377, 32, 275, 257, 1, 96, 11, 22, 266, 510, 954, 317, 5, 27, 2031, 139, 91, 127, 72, 166, 6, 5, 17, 1, 22, 85, 11, 96, 52, 922, 9, 2, 1]"
1024,10,"I have to say I consider this Disney Studio movie cartoon to be their very best ever which was even more enhanced by the impeccable soundtrack. This I believe is destined to be the studios classic of classics and thats saying something when we think of the classics the Disney studios have produced. Frozen has broken all cartoon box office records and it will be a long time before this record is brokenSPOILER BEGINS The story is very loosely based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale The Snow Queen and centres around two sisters who just happened to be Princesses.Both have powers, the eldest, Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel has the power to create snow, ice and winter and Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, has a power but that power is never revealed because while playing in the castle ballroom in the snow which Elsa created Elsa accidentally injures Anna's head and she has to be taken to the Trolls to be cured. In order to do this the power Anna has must be taken from her.Elsa cannot control her power so in order to protect her, Anna and their country the king and queen lock up the castle and lock Elsa away.The years roll away and Anna cannot see her sister and misses her greatly.The king and queen have to go on a trip which involve a sea journey but the ship sinks and both are killed. As Elsa is the eldest she becomes queen. On the day of her coronation the castle is opened and Anna meets Hans (Santino Fantano) a prince from another country and immediately falls in love with him. He proposes to her immediately and she accepts.Elsa the newly crowned queen refuses to allow Anna to marry and they have an argument which ends up with Elsa losing control and because she still cannot control her power she creates a terrible winter all across the land.Realising what she has accidentally done she leaves the town to live in the mountains on her own.Anna leaves the castle to find her sister and bring her back and on her travels meets Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) an ice-maker who is obviously down on his luck because since Elsa has created a perpetual winter he cannot sell his ice. She also meets Olaf (Uncredited) who is Kristoff's reindeer and companion and Olaf (Josh Gad), a living snowman created by Queen Elsa.When Anna finds Elsa, Elsa once again unintentionally wounds Anna with her power, but this time in her heart.Kristoff has to take Anna quickly back to the love of her life Prince Hans because the only thing that can save her is an act of true love so Kristoff assumes that Hans will be able to help Anna, even though Kristoff has inevitably fallen in love with Anna.When the dying Anna arrives home she discovers that Hans does not love her and only wants to kill Elsa, marry Anna and then kill her which will enable him to become king.After this we assume that the act of true love required to save Anna must be done by Kristoff in the form of 'a true loves kiss' but in a refreshingly unusual twist this is not the case.I will not give the final outcome of this movie away.SPOILER ENDS The storyline was exquisite and the acting (voiceovers) were immaculate. Olaf the snowman and Sven the reindeer were absolutely marvellous. The soundtrack was the best I have heard from any Disney cartoon, or any other and husband and wife team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the composers can be more than proud of their compositions.Of the many awards for Frozen this husband and wife duo have won is the Oscar for 'Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song'. The song is 'Let It Be'.On the soundtrack CD the music and songs that they composed but were left out of the movie were equally as good as those left in.An Oscar has also been deservedly won by Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee and Peter Del Vecho for 'Best Animated Feature Film of the Year'.All in all I have no hesitation in saying this movie is more than well worth watching, whether you are 3 or 93.","['say', 'consider', 'disney', 'studio', 'movie', 'cartoon', 'best', 'ever', 'even', 'enhance', 'impeccable', 'soundtrack', 'believe', 'destine', 'studio', 'classic', 'classic', 'thats', 'say',

1028,10,"A very rare 10 of 10 rating from me.Disney has been so ""meh"" lately, I wasn't even interested in seeing Frozen, based on their recent works. I had an immediate change of heart in the opening scene after the Frozen Heart sequence.It was so nice to see a Disney/Pixar that didn't have Randy Newman or his son doing the music. The music direction, the songs and the magnificent score made this movie. These songs brought tears to my eyes. Best score since Lion King.The screenplay was magnificent. Not the same old, run of the mill Pixar you have come to expect. This was classic Disney at its best. The main story was unpredictable as well. You think you know where the story is going, but it takes a turn away from most Disney Princess tales. It sets you up to believe otherwise, sucks you in and then lets loose a very original tale. Even the ubiquitous comic relief sidekick has a limited, albeit, wonderful, appearance that doesn't try to steal the show. The Carrot scene was the funniest thing I have seen in a Disney since I was a kid.The 'Broadway-esque' musical numbers were a treat. Idina Menzel's voice was pure gold. Her rendition of ""Let it go"" was so powerful, so moving. Certainly a best original winner song for this years Oscars.Great characters, great story, great music, great songs and beautiful visuals.Bravo Disney, Bravo.","['rare', 'rating', 'disney', 'meh', 'lately', 'even', 'interested', 'see', 'frozen', 'base', 'recent', 'work', 'immediate', 'change', 'heart', 'opening', 'scene', 'frozen', 'heart', 'sequence', 'nice', 'see', 'disney', 'pixar', 'randy', 'newman', 'son', 'music', 'music', 'direction', 'song', 'magnificent', 'score', 'make', 'movie', 'song', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', 'best', 'score', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'screenplay', 'magnificent', 'old', 'run', 'mill', 'pixar', 'come', 'expect', 'classic', 'disney', 'best', 'main', 'story', 'unpredictable', 'well', 'think', 'know', 'story', 'go', 'take', 'turn', 'away', 'disney', 'princess', 'tale', 'set', 'believe', 'otherwise', 'suck', 'let', 'loose', 'original', 'tale', 'even', 'ubiquitous', 'comic', 'relief', 'sidekick', 'limited', 'albeit', 'wonderful', 'appearance', 'try', 'steal', 'show', 'carrot', 'scene', 'funniest', 'thing', 'see', 'disney', 'since', 'kid', 'broadway', 'esque', 'musical', 'number', 'treat', 'idina', 'menzel', 'voice', 'pure', 'gold', 'rendition', 'let', 'go', 'powerful', 'move', 'certainly', 'best', 'original', 'winner', 'song', 'year', 'oscar', 'great', 'character', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'song', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'bravo', 'disney', 'bravo']","[1308, 437, 2, 2772, 2067, 28, 946, 16, 5, 256, 399, 107, 2178, 209, 80, 631, 90, 5, 80, 502, 192, 16, 2, 194, 3995, 3996, 1269, 58, 58, 754, 11, 935, 223, 14, 1, 11, 599, 748, 336, 34, 223, 98, 152, 97, 1027, 935, 64, 233, 3530, 194, 40, 131, 69, 2, 34, 119, 12, 1904, 18, 37, 56, 12, 13, 55, 113, 101, 2, 29, 114, 144, 220, 827, 1202, 30, 937, 230, 114, 28, 3197, 309, 297, 436, 1576, 2277, 215, 1225, 87, 906, 78, 1146, 90, 1526, 43, 16, 2, 98, 60, 411, 1906, 51, 184, 682, 141, 116, 86, 724, 1920, 3512, 30, 13, 439, 242, 442, 34, 230, 1419, 11, 47, 302, 25, 8, 25, 12, 25, 58, 25, 11, 93, 267, 2851, 2, 2851]"
1029,10,"Let me start out by saying that Frozen is absolutely amazing! Not one thing about this movie irked me and the soundtrack is brilliantly composed and sung. Plus, the cast chosen to voice the characters did a great job too, and I felt a strong bond with almost all of the characters. They were brought to life by the amazing dialogues and singing. If someone asked me to pick a favourite song from the entire movie, I wouldn't be able to as they were all so great. Now, talking more about the movie - I felt like this is such a refreshing change to the stereotypical Disney movies that show you the perfect, elegant, poised princesses who end up marrying the prince only a short while after they've met. The idea of ""true love"" is completely different in Frozen and I like how sibling love is more prominent in the animated film than romantic love. But this doesn't mean that there aren't elements from the latter. Kristoff, a character whom I have fallen in love with, is the perfect partner for Anna, the protagonist. I just feel like their relationship is so lovely, as well as their relationships with other people, like Sven, the reindeer; Olaf, the snowman; Elsa, the sister, etc. This movie is a story of relationships among other things. Moving on to the plot, I think the storyline is phenomenal! We haven't seen a proper Disney adventure for a long time, and this movie successfully gives you just what you're searching for. Also, the scenery in the movie is beautiful - the snow, the castle that Elsa builds, just the Norwegian setting in general. Talking more about the plot, the twists and turns which appear throughout the movie really put an edge to it and keep the viewers interested for more. I don't think I'll ever be able to call Frozen boring. I've seen the movie three times so far and I still haven't gotten tired of watching it. Heck, if you started playing it right now, I'd probably stop what I was doing and watch the movie and even sing along with the songs. It is THAT good! Best movie Disney has ever made, in my opinion. I've never been this fascinated and in love with a movie before as I have now. :)","['let', 'start', 'say', 'frozen', 'absolutely', 'amaze', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'irk', 'soundtrack', 'brilliantly', 'compose', 'sung', 'plus', 'cast', 'chosen', 'voice', 'character', 'great', 'job', 'felt', 'strong', 'bond', 'almost', 'character', 'brought', 'life', 'amaze', 'dialogue', 'sing', 'someone', 'ask', 'pick', 'favourite', 'song', 'entire', 'movie', 'able', 'great', 'talk', 'movie', 'felt', 'like', 'refresh', 'change', 'stereotypical', 'disney', 'movie', 'show', 'perfect', 'elegant', 'poise', 'princess', 'end', 'marry', 'prince', 'short', 'met', 'idea', 'true', 'love', 'completely', 'different', 'frozen', 'like', 'sibling', 'love', 'prominent', 'animate', 'film', 'romantic', 'love', 'mean', 'element', 'latter', 'kristoff', 'character', 'fall', 'love', 'perfect', 'partner', 'anna', 'protagonist', 'feel', 'like', 'relationship', 'lovely', 'well', 'relationship', 'people', 'like', 'sven', 'reindeer', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'elsa', 'sister', 'etc', 'movie', 'story', 'relationship', 'among', 'thing', 'move', 'plot', 'think', 'storyline', 'phenomenal', 'see', 'proper', 'disney', 'adventure', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'successfully', 'give', 'search', 'also', 'scenery', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'snow', 'castle', 'elsa', 'build', 'norwegian', 'set', 'general', 'talk', 'plot', 'twist', 'turn', 'appear', 'throughout', 'movie', 'really', 'put', 'edge', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'think', 'ever', 'able', 'call', 'frozen', 'boring', 'see', 'movie', 'three', 'time', 'far', 'still', 'gotten', 'tire', 'watch', 'heck', 'start', 'play', 'right', 'probably', 'stop', 'watch', 'movie', 'even', 'sing', 'along', 'song', 'good', 'best', 'movie', 'disney', 'ever', 'make', 'opinion', 'never', 'fascinate', 'love', 'movie']","[30, 120, 35, 5, 292, 96, 10, 43, 1, 5063, 225, 1849, 1203, 684, 569, 227, 1841, 86, 8, 25, 373, 155, 167, 482, 173, 8, 599, 79, 96, 719, 63, 304, 581, 1293, 622, 11, 264, 1, 294, 25, 178, 1, 155, 9, 1010, 209, 1567, 2, 1, 78, 175, 2471, 2184, 29, 41, 390, 82, 263, 392, 281, 62, 6, 291, 140, 5, 9, 409, 6, 2835, 38, 3, 393, 6, 218, 401, 955, 67, 8, 186, 6, 175, 2446, 7, 354, 53, 9, 153, 765, 18, 153, 46, 9, 181, 151, 32, 45, 4, 15, 430, 1, 12, 153, 471, 43, 242, 52, 37, 295, 1583, 16, 2195, 2, 326, 169, 20, 1, 1509, 57, 793, 27, 1217, 1, 93, 39, 168, 4, 202, 1260, 144, 623, 178, 52, 129, 113, 582, 296, 1, 22, 196, 1068, 154, 479, 946, 37, 81, 294, 308, 5, 370, 16, 1, 433, 20, 142, 68, 1271, 1086, 23, 1325, 120, 204, 130, 210, 284, 23, 1, 28, 63, 172, 11, 17, 34, 1, 2, 81, 14, 258, 88, 1140, 6, 1]"

1031,8,"When this movie came out I thought it was nice how it subverted the princess fairy tale tropes: that the love that broke the spell didn't come from some random Prince but from the love between sisters, and that the bad guy wasn't some evil enchantress in a dark tower but an inconspicuous, lovable guy that would've functioned as a love interest in another movie. But now that I think about it, the classic Disney animations from the 90's - such as The Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King - already did the fairy tale modernization and subversion. Actually even Sleeping Beauty had some meta humor in the 50's.What Frozen represents is a return to the Disney 'Renaissance' style. It is a larger-than-life adventure full of magic, romance, whimsy and life lessons. It teaches you to believe in yourself, to care for your family, to open up and trust, to deal with issues... like any proper Disney film will. And it is a musical. The songs are by now so famous that most parents are overexposed to them. 'Let It Go' won the Oscar and will be a sing-along staple for a while to come: 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman' took its place among other beloved Disney storytelling music. My personal favorite is the simple, feelgood pop ballad 'Love is an Open Door'.The snow and ice is beautifully animated - the Disney animation division is really pushing what we can do with CG animation. I've read some criticism that the princesses look exactly the same as Rapunzel from 'Tangled', but Disney princesses have always been cookie-cutter cuties and it doesn't bother me.","['movie', 'come', 'thought', 'nice', 'subvert', 'princess', 'fairy', 'tale', 'trope', 'love', 'broke', 'spell', 'come', 'random', 'prince', 'love', 'sister', 'bad', 'guy', 'evil', 'enchantress', 'dark', 'tower', 'inconspicuous', 'lovable', 'guy', 'would', 'function', 'love', 'interest', 'another', 'movie', 'think', 'classic', 'disney', 'animation', 'beauty', 'beast', 'aladdin', 'lion', 'king', 'already', 'fairy', 'tale', 'modernization', 'subversion', 'actually', 'even', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'meta', 'humor', 'frozen', 'represent', 'return', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'style', 'large', 'life', 'adventure', 'full', 'magic', 'romance', 'whimsy', 'life', 'lesson', 'teach', 'believe', 'care', 'family', 'open', 'trust', 'deal', 'issue', 'like', 'proper', 'disney', 'film', 'musical', 'song', 'famous', 'parent', 'overexpose', 'let', 'go', 'oscar', 'sing', 'along', 'staple', 'come', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'take', 'place', 'among', 'beloved', 'disney', 'storytelling', 'music', 'personal', 'favorite', 'simple', 'feelgood', 'pop', 'ballad', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'snow', 'ice', 'beautifully', 'animate', 'disney', 'animation', 'division', 'really', 'push', 'cg', 'animation', 'read', 'criticism', 'princess', 'look', 'exactly', 'rapunzel', 'tangle', 'disney', 'princess', 'always', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'cuties', 'bother']","[1, 40, 92, 192, 2507, 29, 219, 114, 1032, 6, 1802, 858, 40, 1180, 82, 6, 15, 65, 148, 277, 628, 2496, 726, 148, 26, 2887, 6, 122, 102, 1, 37, 69, 2, 21, 149, 203, 485, 152, 97, 397, 219, 114, 5094, 3017, 103, 28, 1090, 149, 222, 5, 1194, 385, 2, 465, 355, 977, 79, 326, 246, 150, 363, 79, 499, 621, 220, 293, 72, 318, 836, 701, 519, 9, 2195, 2, 3, 51, 11, 903, 118, 30, 13, 302, 63, 172, 1704, 40, 59, 202, 45, 55, 188, 471, 1280, 2, 689, 58, 537, 189, 516, 658, 1265, 6, 318, 478, 39, 33, 529, 38, 2, 21, 5221, 22, 809, 1303, 21, 547, 1091, 29, 66, 522, 527, 83, 2, 29, 163, 4956, 3241, 864]"
1032,10,"As this Disney animated film opens it is winter in the small kingdom of Arendelle; Princess Anna wakes Elsa, her older sister, so that they can make snowmen and enjoy the snow. They don't have to go outside though as Elsa has a magical power; she can conjure snow and ice from thin air or freeze any object. As they play Elsa accidentally injures her sister, Anna is healed but has all memories of what happened and of Elsa's 'gift' erased. Elsa is cautioned that as he grows her power will become more powerful and more dangerous. Scared of hurting anybody she shuts herself away. Sometime later her parents are lost in a shipwreck and three years after that she comes of age and is due to be crowned Queen. People come from all around to attend the coronation; including the handsome Prince Hans who Anna falls in love with. After the ceremony Anna asks Elsa to give her blessing for her to marry Hans Elsa refuses and as the sisters argue Elsa's power is exposed to everybody. Branded a monster Elsa flees the country; heading to the North Mountain where she creates a castle of ice. The country is thrown into winter and Anna sets out to find her sister leaving Hans to rule. On the way north Anna teams up with Kristoff, an ice supplier, and his reindeer Sven. Their journey won't be easy and the dangers won't be over when they find Elsa.Before watching 'Frozen' I wasn't sure what to expect; I knew it was bound to look great and had some catchy songs; I don't imagine anybody hasn't heard 'Let it Go' umpteen times even if they haven't watched the film yet. I hadn't been watching long before I was hooked; the opening was fun but quickly turned darker than I expected as first Elsa appears to reject Anna, for reasons the viewer knows but Anna doesn't, then their parents die. Just as it looks as if things will brighten up when Elsa is made queen and Anna falls in love things get even darker as Elsa leaves to live an isolated life. It isn't depressing though; Anna and Kristoff's journey north is exciting and some extra lightness is added when they meet Olaf, a living snowman. Without going into too much detail we then get more peril, a potential tragedy and a shocking betrayal before the uplifting finale one expects from a Disney film. As expected the animation was pretty spectacular; the characters were really good; great good guys and some suitably dastardly villains. Overall I'd certainly recommend watching this; it is a delightful film for people of all ages.","['disney', 'animate', 'film', 'open', 'winter', 'small', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'princess', 'anna', 'wake', 'elsa', 'old', 'sister', 'make', 'snowman', 'enjoy', 'snow', 'go', 'outside', 'though', 'elsa', 'magical', 'power', 'conjure', 'snow', 'ice', 'thin', 'air', 'freeze', 'object', 'play', 'elsa', 'accidentally', 'injures', 'sister', 'anna', 'heal', 'memory', 'happen', 'elsa', 'gift', 'erase', 'elsa', 'caution', 'grows', 'power', 'become', 'powerful', 'dangerous', 'scar', 'hurt', 'anybody', 'shuts', 'away', 'sometime', 'later', 'parent', 'lose', 'shipwreck', 'three', 'year', 'come', 'age', 'due', 'crown', 'queen', 'people', 'come', 'around', 'attend', 'coronation', 'include', 'handsome', 'prince', 'han', 'anna', 'fall', 'love', 'ceremony', 'anna', 'asks', 'elsa', 'give', 'blessing', 'marry', 'han', 'elsa', 'refuse', 'sister', 'argue', 'elsa', 'power', 'expose', 'everybody', 'brand', 'monster', 'elsa', 'flees', 'country', 'head', 'north', 'mountain', 'creates', 'castle', 'ice', 'country', 'thrown', 'winter', 'anna', 'set', 'find', 'sister', 'leave', 'han', 'rule', 'way', 'north', 'anna', 'team', 'kristoff', 'ice', 'supplier', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'journey', 'easy', 'danger', 'find', 'elsa', 'watch', 'frozen', 'sure', 'expect', 'knew', 'bound', 'look', 'great', 'catchy', 'song', 'imagine', 'anybody', 'heard', 'let', 'go', 'umpteen', 'time', 'even', 'watch', 'film', 'yet', 'watch', 'long', 'hooked', 'opening', 'fun', 'quickly', 'turn', 'darker', 'expect', 'first', 'elsa', 'appear', 'reject', 'anna', 'reason', 'viewer', 'know', 'anna', 'parent', 'die', 'look', 'thing', 'brighten', 'elsa', 'make', 'queen', 'anna', 'fall', 'love', 'thing', 'get', 'even', 'darker', 'elsa', 'leaf', 'live', 'isolated', 'life', 'depress', 'though', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'journey', 'north', 'excite', 'extra', 'lightness', 'add', 'meet', 'olaf', 'living', 'snowman', 'without', 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'get', 'peril', 'potential', 'tragedy', 'shock', 'betrayal', 'uplift', 'finale', 'one', 'expect', 'disney', 'film', 'expect', 'animation', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'character', 'really', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'guy', 'suitably', 'dastardly', 'villain', 'overall', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'delightful', 'film', 'people', 'age']","[2, 38, 3, 318, 105, 601, 77, 199, 29, 7, 1238, 4, 64, 15, 14, 45, 91, 39, 13, 769, 100, 4, 170, 24, 2156, 39, 33, 1306, 1323, 282, 1491, 204, 4, 300, 1928, 15, 7, 1234, 412, 290, 4, 832, 972, 4, 3287, 1291, 24, 179, 439, 702, 878, 305, 2041, 2878, 101, 2903, 358, 118, 489, 3997, 433, 47, 40, 139, 404, 722, 49, 46, 40, 200, 3893, 343, 349, 739, 82, 44, 7, 186, 6, 1851, 7, 1760, 4, 57, 1528, 390, 44, 4, 1383, 15, 1247, 4, 24, 1318, 841, 1545, 495, 4, 710, 872, 317, 1252, 214, 797, 168, 33, 872, 1121, 105, 7, 144, 71, 15, 322, 44, 788, 50, 1252, 7, 486, 67, 33, 151, 181, 337, 454, 901, 71, 4, 23, 5, 207, 131, 488, 2050, 66, 25, 266, 11, 1137, 2041, 357, 30, 13, 5222, 20, 28, 23, 3, 182, 23, 169, 2503, 631, 125, 733, 113, 1240, 131, 36, 4, 582, 1836, 7, 180, 479, 56, 7, 118, 368, 66, 43, 4, 14, 49, 7, 186, 6, 43, 19, 28, 1240, 4, 586, 224, 782, 79, 2364, 100, 7, 67, 337, 1252, 447, 1237, 269, 244, 32, 704, 45, 137, 13, 31, 468, 19, 3200, 685, 2905, 666, 1810, 1955, 3977, 10, 131, 2, 3, 131, 21, 136, 671, 8, 22, 17, 25, 17, 148, 3780, 104, 166, 442, 262, 23, 1459, 3, 46, 139]"
1033,10,"Frozen (2013): Dir: Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee / Voices: Kristin Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, Santino Fontana: Enchanting animated treasure that references the thawing of the heart and the exploration of feelings. Elsa is about to be crown queen but she fears a secret will surface that involves her uncontrollable power to freeze. This power isolated her from her younger sister, Anna when her powers caused an accident. With their parents deceased and the castle closed down time has passed for the new crowning. Central plot regards everything being turned to ice and snow when Elsa's powers cut lose. She flees the scene and seeks further isolation while authority considers her a wicked spiritualist. Anna seeks her out treking into the winter and finds assistance from Kristoff, who cuts and sells ice, along with his good natured reindeer, Sven. They also encounter Olaf, a high spirited snowman whom was a childhood creation of Elsa's when they were young. With plot turns and dazzling animated images this is a must for family viewing. Kristin Bell voices Anna who desires a relationship with her sister after years of being apart and she risks her life to connect. Idina Menzel voices Elsa who is seen as the villain but her ice powers reflect a connection long broken but not without promise of repair. Jonathan Groff voices the reluctant Kristoff, and Josh Gad steals moments as the voice of Gad who desires the warmth of summer. Santino Fontana voices Prince Hans who orders the search Elsa. Wonderful family animation about breaking through the ice to inner warmth.

1034,8,"This was already the third or fourth time I watched Disney's Frozen and this is especially impressive as this film was released only slightly over 2 years ago. In my opinion, these 100 minutes prove that Disney is still on par with Pixar, even if you have to keep in mind that the likes of Lasseter worked on this film as well. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee adapted this famous Hans Christian Andersen tale and also directed the film. Very deserving Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature and I am also happy about Kristen Anderson and Robert Lopez winning for the magnificent ""Let It Go"", even if I liked the Golden Globe winning song from U2 too. Back to the film, it is a great story on sisterhood, about finding the right person for you, but most of all this film is worth watching for the great humor and outstanding looks. The snow world is so beautiful, there are many visually stunning scenes. In terms of the comedy, there is hardly a minute, during which you will not be entertained. This film put a smile on my lips so so many times, be it Kristoff singing for his moose, Olaf (everything about him, especially ""I have no bones"", so awkwardly funny).I have to say I am not a great fan of Kristen Bell and she is probably the most prominent cast member. But here she is fine, just like all the other voice actors. The story, of course, helps them a lot. Some real movie magic in here, several unexpected plot developments will have you glued to the screen. The good thing is it is never stupid or unrealistic. It all works well in my opinion. The drama is as good as the comedy. And it is a truly heartfelt film. Apart from the previously-mentioned ""Let It Go"", there are a handful other wonderful songs in here. I will not list the titles because you can check them in the list of songs, or even better watch the movie (again), but they were all extremely catchy. No exceptions.All in all, as you obviously know by now, I really dig this film. Certainly a contender for best 2013 movie for me and it is not getting any worse on rewatch either. If you like it as much as I do, make sure to check out the short film that followed not too long ago, even if it was nowhere near as great as the full feature film. I wonder if they will ever make a sequel to this one. The great reception from audiences, critics and awards bodies makes me think that it could be very possible. However, they really need to make sure to come up with something new and creative that makes sense in the grand scheme of things, taking the first film into consideration. If they succeed to do so, I am not scared at all of a sequel, but looking forward to it a lot. Anyway, how can you doubt Disney and Pixar these days. Basically all their new films are winners right now. Just like this one. Highly, highly recommended, if you are one of the 2 people who have not seen this film yet. ""Animation is for kids"" is not only not an invalid excuse, it is also not true at all. Your loss then I guess, so go check it out. You will not regret it.","['already', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'watch', 'disney', 'frozen', 'especially', 'impressive', 'film', 'release', 'slightly', 'year', 'ago', 'opinion', 'minute', 'prove', 'disney', 'still', 'par', 'pixar', 'even', 'keep', 'mind', 'like', 'lasseter', 'work', 'film', 'well', 'chris', 'buck', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'adapt', 'famous', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'tale', 'also', 'direct', 'film', 'deserve', 'academy', 'award', 'winner', 'best', 'animate', 'feature', 'also', 'happy', 'kristen', 'anderson', 'robert', 'lopez', 'win', 'magnificent', 'let', 'go', 'even', 'like', 'golden', 'globe', 'win', 'song', 'u', 'back', 'film', 'great', 'story', 'sisterhood', 'find', 'right', 'person', 'film', 'worth', 'watch', 'great', 'humor', 'outstanding', 'look', 'snow', 'world', 'beautiful', 'many', 'visually', 'stun', 'scene', 'term', 'comedy', 'hardly', 'minute', 'entertain', 'film', 'put', 'smile', 'lip', 'many', 'time', 'kristoff', 'sing', 'moose', 'olaf', 'everything', 'especially', 'bone', 'awkwardly', 'funny', 'say', 'great', 'fan', 'kristen', 'bell', 'probably', 'prominent', 'cast', 'member', 'fine', 'like', 'voice', 'actor', 'story', 'course', 'help', 'lot', 'real', 'movie', 'magic', 'several', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'development', 'glue', 'screen', 'good', 'thing', 'never', 'stupid', 'unrealistic', 'work', 'well', 'opinion', 'drama', 'good', 'comedy', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'apart', 'previously', 'mention', 'let', 'go', 'handful', 'wonderful', 'song', 'list', 'title', 'check', 'list', 'song', 'even', 'well', 'watch', 'movie', 'extremely', 'catchy', 'exception', 'obviously', 'know', 'really', 'dig', 'film', 'certainly', 'contender', 'best', 'movie', 'get', 'bad', 'rewatch', 'either', 'like', 'much', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'short', 'film', 'follow', 'long', 'ago', 'even', 'nowhere', 'near', 'great', 'full', 'feature', 'film', 'wonder', 'ever', 'make', 'sequel', 'one', 'great', 'reception', 'audience', 'critic', 'award', 'body', 'make', 'think', 'could', 'possible', 'however', 'really', 'need', 'make', 'sure', 'come', 'something', 'new', 'creative', 'make', 'sense', 'grand', 'scheme', 'thing', 'take', 'first', 'film', 'consideration', 'succeed', 'scar', 'sequel', 'look', 'forward', 'lot', 'anyway', 'doubt', 'disney', 'pixar', 'day', 'basically', 'new', 'film', 'winner', 'right', 'like', 'one', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'people', 'see', 'film', 'yet', 'animation', 'kid', 'invalid', 'excuse', 'also', 'true', 'loss', 'guess', 'go', 'check', 'regret']","[397, 715, 5005, 20, 23, 2, 5, 121, 933, 3, 288, 774, 47, 683, 258, 211, 799, 2, 68, 1028, 194, 28, 154, 320, 9, 2046, 107, 3, 18, 526, 490, 464, 416, 912, 903, 44, 245, 339, 114, 27, 721, 3, 483, 856, 469, 1419, 34, 38, 229, 27, 301, 162, 467, 1421, 928, 374, 935, 30, 13, 28, 9, 796, 1521, 374, 11, 177, 74, 3, 25, 12, 861, 71, 130, 441, 3, 254, 23, 25, 222, 764, 66, 39, 126, 93, 61, 585, 315, 90, 657, 279, 976, 211, 243, 3, 196, 914, 2515, 61, 20, 67, 63, 1503, 32, 132, 121, 2614, 3120, 85, 35, 25, 176, 162, 146, 210, 2835, 227, 1212, 470, 9, 86, 518, 12, 228, 135, 84, 195, 1, 150, 608, 894, 52, 356, 3741, 369, 17, 43, 88, 494, 2281, 107, 18, 258, 745, 17, 279, 329, 1402, 3, 512, 1870, 348, 30, 13, 3406, 215, 11, 550, 590, 1310, 550, 11, 28, 18, 23, 1, 423, 266, 645, 613, 56, 22, 1615, 3, 442, 4189, 34, 1, 19, 65, 2945, 353, 9, 31, 14, 207, 1310, 263, 3, 378, 169, 683, 28, 801, 449, 25, 246, 229, 3, 532, 81, 14, 561, 10, 25, 3944, 159, 730, 469, 1220, 14, 37, 54, 673, 110, 22, 99, 14, 207, 40, 89, 108, 1014, 14, 217, 936, 1467, 43, 55, 36, 3, 3267, 1101, 878, 561, 66, 571, 84, 497, 681, 2, 194, 138, 570, 108, 3, 1419, 130, 9, 10, 472, 472, 262, 10, 46, 16, 3, 182, 21, 60, 1229, 27, 62, 1927, 388, 13, 1310, 1900]"
1035,9,"I really liked the movie! It had a lot of surprising scene's and of course, everything animated looks surreal that you wouldn't think it was actually animated. I thought Olaf was such a cute little snowman, I just wanna cuddle him and it's obvious that he likes warm hugs haha! Elsa and Anna had such a roller coaster ride in trying to reunite each other. It can be hard to watch like if you had a wonderful sister abroad, it can be difficult to see her and for her to see you, that would hold back if you don't have enough money to travel. However, I'm glad in the end, they both lived happily ever after and Elsa becomes Queen of Adendale again. I honestly love the fashion sense of the sisters. Although I have to say, Elsa is the winner there. I loved her dress as it was so beautiful with sparkles and the see - through cape covering her sky blue dress. She is such a stunning Disney Princess. I was really shocked but i kinda knew well that Hans became a selfish b****** near the end. I honestly hate him more then the rest of the other villains since it was just totally cruel and wrong to leave Anna left for dead in the cold. Thankfully he got a smack on the face from her and shipped back to his 12 brothers in another country haha. That'll teach him to mess with the wrong woman!It's a nice movie but I think it would be better to watch this with family than on your own!","['really', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'surprising', 'scene', 'course', 'everything', 'animate', 'look', 'surreal', 'think', 'actually', 'animate', 'thought', 'olaf', 'cute', 'little', 'snowman', 'wan', 'cuddle', 'obvious', 'like', 'warm', 'hug', 'haha', 'elsa', 'anna', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'try', 'reunite', 'hard', 'watch', 'like', 'wonderful', 'sister', 'abroad', 'difficult', 'see', 'see', 'would', 'hold', 'back', 'enough', 'money', 'travel', 'however', 'glad', 'end', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'elsa', 'becomes', 'queen', 'adendale', 'honestly', 'love', 'fashion', 'sense', 'sister', 'although', 'say', 'elsa', 'winner', 'love', 'dress', 'beautiful', 'sparkle', 'see', 'cape', 'cover', 'sky', 'blue', 'dress', 'stun', 'disney', 'princess', 'really', 'shock', 'kinda', 'knew', 'well', 'han', 'become', 'selfish', 'b', 'near', 'end', 'honestly', 'hate', 'rest', 'villain', 'since', 'totally', 'cruel', 'wrong', 'leave', 'anna', 'left', 'dead', 'cold', 'thankfully', 'get', 'smack', 'face', 'ship', 'back', 'brother', 'another', 'country', 'haha', 'teach', 'mess', 'wrong', 'woman', 'nice', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'well', 'watch', 'family']","[22, 9, 1, 84, 1029, 90, 228, 132, 38, 66, 4696, 37, 103, 38, 92, 32, 265, 48, 45, 779, 3627, 595, 9, 362, 1236, 1977, 4, 7, 2847, 2848, 1305, 87, 1793, 307, 23, 9, 215, 15, 1113, 16, 16, 26, 655, 74, 164, 661, 1766, 110, 818, 41, 224, 795, 81, 4, 380, 49, 542, 6, 974, 217, 15, 255, 35, 4, 1419, 6, 907, 93, 2226, 16, 3735, 712, 1395, 991, 907, 315, 2, 29, 22, 666, 629, 488, 18, 44, 179, 1558, 1569, 449, 41, 542, 333, 303, 104, 98, 557, 2452, 280, 322, 7, 330, 831, 366, 1910, 19, 2314, 381, 1409, 74, 865, 102, 872, 1977, 621, 1025, 280, 251, 192, 1, 37, 26, 18, 23, 72]"
1036,8,"The Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen contains some messages such as the battle between the good and evil, and that love can thaw the frozen heart. Frozen, on the other hand contains some other messages, such as not battle between good and evil, but facing your fears and fighting for the ones you love. So thawing the frozen heart in here is actually showing the power of love upon your fears, and not power of love upon the evil. The Snow Queen is originally a villain in the fairytale and making her actually a protagonist in this version was pretty smart, I would say, but I think that her villain side could be much more shown after she gets isolated on the mountain. And there it lays another flaw of Frozen, the lack of villains. I think that Duke of Weselton was not needed distraction who was not scary, and hell he wasn't even funny. And I felt that Hans being a villain was a bit forced. His intentions to claim the throne were not strong enough in my opinion to form him as a villain. It would have been much better if the focus of the film stayed on Elsa trying to fight her powers and perhaps slowly turning herself into a villain. The characters are very relatable, we can recognize Elsa and Anna within our own feelings and actions. Feeling trapped in something for which you could only blame yourself or the fate and not being able to talk about it, we have all been in similar situations where we just needed to shout 'Let it go', when our loved ones were sad because of us and they could not understand. The scene where only door separates Elsa and Anna, at the end of 'Do you wanna build a snowman?' just tears you apart because you know how both of them feel. Anna is perky and goofy and really opened to the world and we can all relate to her awkwardness and clumsiness. The comic relief is very good, Olaf is really funny, they really took advantage of any joke that could have been made with a snowman. The reindeer Sven is pretty funny too, even though he doesn't say anything, his face expressions and the way he moves is hilarious. Kristoff is also a fun character, he can get some laughs. He is lovable, but yet not do developed as Elsa or Anna, but he does not need to be. The trolls were also not so needed, the song sequence with them was a bit too long and tiring and they were charming but not so much. They were cheerful and upbeat but maybe too much. In the fairytale on the other hand, the troll or the devil was a villain who made made that mirror which makes everything good seems bad and everything bad seems wonderful. He was much more of a character than a bunch of loud singing rock-like balls and as I previous mentioned it adds up to the lack of true villain. But the trolls being good is an acceptable and important part to the plot, but still I think they should have gotten much less screen time. The landscape was beautiful. It was amazing to see what they have actually done with the winter and it was fun enjoyable to watch. The songs were great and memorable, with the exception of the troll-song. That is Frozen, people. If we are going to compare it to the original source, well, it is pointless. Too many changes were done and with some similarities, those are two completely different stories. Frozen has its flaws, they are transparent, but also it is overall very fun, enjoyable and even touching to watch. Relationship between two sisters is real and touching, and if you cried on Frozen, I won't judge because even with all its flaws Frozen is great flick and when you'll watch it you're going to laugh, sing along and even cry.","['snow', 'queen', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'contains', 'message', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'love', 'thaw', 'frozen', 'heart', 'frozen', 'hand', 'contains', 'message', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'face', 'fear', 'fight', 'one', 'love', 'thaw', 'frozen', 'heart', 'actually', 'show', 'power', 'love', 'upon', 'fear', 'power', 'love', 'upon', 'evil', 'snow', 'queen', 'originally', 'villain', 'fairytale', 'make', 'actually', 'protagonist', 'version', 'pretty', 'smart', 'would', 'say', 'think', 'villain', 'side', 'could', 'much', 'show', 'get', 'isolated', 'mountain', 'lay', 'another', 'flaw', 'frozen', 'lack', 'villain', 'think', 'duke', 'weselton', 'need', 'distraction', 'scary', 'hell', 'even', 'funny', 'felt', 'han', 'villain', 'bit', 'force', 'intention', 'claim', 'throne', 'strong', 'enough', 'opinion', 'form', 'villain', 'would', 'much', 'well', 'focus', 'film', 'stayed', 'elsa', 'try', 'fight', 'power', 'perhaps', 'slowly', 'turn', 'villain', 'character', 'relatable', 'recognize', 'elsa', 'anna', 'within', 'feeling', 'action', 'feel', 'trap', 'something', 'could', 'blame', 'fate', 'able', 'talk', 'similar', 'situation', 'need', 'shout', 'let', 'go', 'love', 'one', 'sad', 'u', 'could', 'understand', 'scene', 'door', 'separate', 'elsa', 'anna', 'end', 'wan', 'build', 'snowman', 'tear', 'apart', 'know', 'feel', 'anna', 'perky', 'goofy', 'really', 'open', 'world', 'relate', 'awkwardness', 'clumsiness', 'comic', 'relief', 'good', 'olaf', 'really', 'funny', 'really', 'take', 'advantage', 'joke', 'could', 'make', 'snowman', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'pretty', 'funny', 'even', 'though', 'say', 'anything', 'face', 'expression', 'way', 'move', 'hilarious', 'kristoff', 'also', 'fun', 'character', 'get', 'laugh', 'lovable', 'yet', 'developed', 'elsa', 'anna', 'need', 'troll', 'also', 'need', 'song', 'sequence', 'bit', 'long', 'tire', 'charm', 'much', 'cheerful', 'upbeat', 'maybe', 'much', 'fairytale', 'hand', 'troll', 'devil', 'villain', 'make', 'make', 'mirror', 'make', 'everything', 'good', 'seem', 'bad', 'everything', 'bad', 'seem', 'wonderful', 'much', 'character', 'bunch', 'loud', 'sing', 'rock', 'like', 'ball', 'previous', 'mention', 'add', 'lack', 'true', 'villain', 'troll', 'good', 'acceptable', 'important', 'part', 'plot', 'still', 'think', 'gotten', 'much', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'landscape', 'beautiful', 'amaze', 'see', 'actually', 'winter', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'song', 'great', 'memorable', 'exception', 'troll', 'song', 'frozen', 'people', 'go', 'compare', 'original', 'source', 'well', 'pointless', 'many', 'change', 'similarity', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'frozen', 'flaw', 'transparent', 'also', 'overall', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'touch', 'watch', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'real', 'touch', 'cry', 'frozen', 'judge', 'even', 'flaw', 'frozen', 'great', 'flick', 'watch', 'go', 'laugh', 'sing', 'along', 'even', 'cry']","[39, 49, 44, 245, 339, 1054, 185, 1435, 17, 277, 6, 775, 5, 80, 5, 323, 1054, 185, 1435, 17, 277, 381, 187, 816, 10, 6, 775, 5, 80, 103, 78, 24, 6, 554, 187, 24, 6, 554, 277, 39, 49, 1511, 104, 756, 14, 103, 354, 435, 136, 1001, 26, 35, 37, 104, 387, 54, 31, 78, 19, 782, 214, 2704, 102, 386, 5, 273, 104, 37, 762, 1233, 99, 1860, 1634, 778, 28, 85, 155, 44, 104, 95, 272, 1659, 1042, 952, 167, 164, 258, 427, 104, 26, 31, 18, 261, 3, 2039, 4, 87, 816, 24, 578, 2743, 113, 104, 8, 884, 1428, 4, 7, 654, 680, 345, 53, 900, 89, 54, 1631, 1648, 294, 178, 446, 867, 99, 2716, 30, 13, 6, 10, 579, 177, 54, 216, 90, 478, 786, 4, 7, 41, 779, 202, 45, 748, 512, 56, 53, 7, 3281, 961, 22, 318, 126, 785, 2510, 4138, 309, 297, 17, 32, 22, 85, 22, 55, 2179, 451, 54, 14, 45, 151, 181, 136, 85, 28, 100, 35, 212, 381, 1069, 50, 242, 364, 67, 27, 125, 8, 19, 190, 726, 182, 610, 4, 7, 99, 123, 27, 99, 11, 502, 95, 169, 1086, 235, 31, 1638, 1617, 232, 31, 756, 323, 123, 3385, 104, 14, 14, 1944, 14, 132, 17, 75, 65, 132, 65, 75, 215, 31, 8, 1211, 798, 63, 834, 9, 2243, 763, 348, 269, 273, 62, 104, 123, 17, 2341, 289, 94, 52, 68, 37, 1271, 31, 321, 369, 20, 889, 93, 96, 16, 103, 105, 125, 306, 23, 11, 25, 268, 645, 123, 11, 5, 46, 13, 350, 230, 1092, 18, 898, 61, 209, 1736, 42, 291, 140, 12, 5, 386, 2978, 27, 166, 125, 306, 28, 260, 23, 153, 42, 15, 195, 260, 505, 5, 1592, 28, 386, 5, 25, 805, 23, 13, 190, 63, 172, 28, 505]"
1037,10,"Frozen is ,at first, royal and unique but as the film progresses Frozen becomes an epic story that never seems to bore me. First off, Elsa has FREAKING ICE MAGIC! ICE. MAGIC. Everything about her powers is beautiful. For example, the hand motions she uses when using her powers in ""Let it Go"" to ""Let it Go"", the song itself. Another example (Source from tumblr) is that the way she uses her magic has something to do with her mood. If she is scared (When Hans finds the ice castle), her magic is jagged, pointy, and rough. When she uses her magic at the end when thawing Arendelle or freezing the 2 fountains, she is happy and her magic is beautiful, majestic, and mystical. Second, Anna. Anna is, in my point of view, the, if not one of the, best princesses ever. She is NOT a graceful sleeper (which doesn't really matter to me) but she is quirky, clumsy, and awkward. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think there has ever been a socially awkward princess before. Anna's bond with Elsa is also magic. That's another thing too. The thing that makes Frozen awesome is that the moral at the end is that Kristoff doesn't hug Anna or something. Elsa has spent her entire life trying to protect Anna from herself and the dangers that her powers possess and therefore is the one who DRAPES herself in agony and sorrow over Anna. Frozen showed that true love comes in many forms, not just Man and Woman but Sibling and Sibling. I'd also like to note that if you listen to the lyrics of Fixer Upper, it has a REALLY nice and awesome message.","['frozen', 'first', 'royal', 'unique', 'film', 'progress', 'frozen', 'becomes', 'epic', 'story', 'never', 'seem', 'bore', 'first', 'elsa', 'freak', 'ice', 'magic', 'ice', 'magic', 'everything', 'power', 'beautiful', 'example', 'hand', 'motion', 'us', 'use', 'power', 'let', 'go', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'another', 'example', 'source', 'tumblr', 'way', 'us', 'magic', 'something', 'mood', 'scar', 'han', 'find', 'ice', 'castle', 'magic', 'jagged', 'pointy', 'rough', 'us', 'magic', 'end', 'thaw', 'arendelle', 'freeze', 'fountain', 'happy', 'magic', 'beautiful', 'majestic', 'mystical', 'second', 'anna', 'anna', 'point', 'view', 'one', 'best', 'princess', 'ever', 'graceful', 'sleeper', 'really', 'matter', 'quirky', 'clumsy', 'awkward', 'correct', 'wrong', 'think', 'ever', 'socially', 'awkward', 'princess', 'anna', 'bond', 'elsa', 'also', 'magic', 'another', 'thing', 'thing', 'make', 'frozen', 'awesome', 'moral', 'end', 'kristoff', 'hug', 'anna', 'something', 'elsa', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'try', 'protect', 'anna', 'danger', 'power', 'posse', 'therefore', 'one', 'drape', 'agony', 'sorrow', 'anna', 'frozen', 'show', 'true', 'love', 'come', 'many', 'form', 'man', 'woman', 'sibling', 'sibling', 'also', 'like', 'note', 'listen', 'lyric', 'fixer', 'upper', 'really', 'nice', 'awesome', 'message']","[5, 36, 870, 414, 3, 1149, 5, 380, 566, 12, 88, 75, 604, 36, 4, 1160, 33, 150, 33, 150, 132, 24, 93, 396, 323, 1507, 919, 158, 24, 30, 13, 30, 13, 11, 102, 396, 1092, 50, 919, 150, 89, 1084, 878, 44, 71, 33, 168, 150, 4252, 2057, 919, 150, 41, 775, 199, 282, 301, 150, 93, 2457, 1542, 319, 7, 7, 117, 413, 10, 34, 29, 81, 2354, 22, 375, 908, 1262, 810, 1462, 280, 37, 81, 2528, 810, 29, 7, 482, 4, 27, 150, 102, 43, 43, 14, 5, 338, 551, 41, 67, 1236, 7, 89, 4, 992, 264, 79, 87, 513, 7, 901, 24, 1215, 1241, 10, 4560, 2356, 7, 5, 78, 62, 6, 40, 61, 427, 145, 251, 409, 409, 27, 9, 625, 531, 475, 772, 737, 22, 192, 338, 185]"
1038,4,"'Frozen' is Disney's animation studio's latest feature and has been receiving praise and recognition for it's musical numbers, screenplay, and being compare to the Disney Renaissance. There was one time I could recall an add for Frozen being played on the television comparing to 'The Lion King'. Friends and family were urging me to see it saying ""It amazing. It's the best! You haven't seen it? Then there must be something damn wrong with you!"". I thought "" Could this be Disney's chance to revive itself back into former glory?"" (by the way the only reason why I didn't rush in to see Frozen in cinemas was that annoying 'Let It Go' song. When you have two younger sister's singing the song repeatedly, it can make you go crazy.) So I watched it hoping that it could reached the supposedly Disney Renaissance quality. and.....and.... nothing... Okay, it's not a bad film at all. It's fine. Compare it other animated films and you can still see that Disney Animation studies is still on top of the ladder regarding animation.( I can see that the DreamWorks, and Blue Sky studios are creeping on Disney's/Pixar's backs with the quality of their films- Pixar however is still holding on.) However on a Disney level, comparing it past animated films, it's quite disappointing. Frozen is about two sisters who are princesses. Elsa, who has powers to manipulate snow and ice and her younger sister Anna. Anna questions why Elsa shuts her out. After a little fight Elsa sets the kingdom into a internal winter. The storyline was completely rushed. There wasn't really an 'epic journey'across the snow. I did not feel for any of the characters at all. Youwill be surprised how many plot holes and unanswered questions are in the film.(Note: I haven't read 'The Snow Queen'-the story that it is based on, but shouldn't they develop the characters if the actual story focuses on the depth into the characters?) The characters are really forgettable. It's as if there trying to be new and different from past Disney animation movies, but it really comes off as awkward. I thought Tangled was able to pull that off well, but this...I think they were trying too hard. I surprised how this got lots of acclaim and yet Tangled only got a little amount of recognition. Now this is the part I am the most disappointed about; there isn't really a climax with the villain. Disney films usually have the bad guy playing a huge part in the film. Sadly with this film, they tried to focus more on the connection between the two sisters, but when the whole entire film is rushed, that connection obliviously fails. Oh and they forgot to build up the villains! Everyone likes a villain in Disney films. With Frozen they tried to pull the 'unexpected bad guy twist' so they can attempt to focus on the other characters. Once again you do not see development of the villains. These villains complete wimps compared to the others villains in Disney films. On the bright side if you love computer animation, the visuals are of course great. This keeps improving. The musical numbers are okay. Their easily unforgettable because they all the musical numbers sounded the same. (Personally, I would love for Disney to return back to it's 2D animation roots or ad least try and pull off animation like Disney's short film ""Paperman"" (2012) which is one of my favourite short films from Disney from all time.) Overall this film is just easily forgettable, but better than some of the animated films made today. I don't get what a lot of the hype is about. I hope Disney with eventually redeem themselves for what there good at, and that's storytelling.","['frozen', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'late', 'feature', 'receive', 'praise', 'recognition', 'musical', 'number', 'screenplay', 'compare', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'one', 'time', 'could', 'recall', 'add', 'frozen', 'played', 'television', 'compare', 'lion', 'king', 'friend', 'family', 'urge', 'see', 'say', 'amaze', 'best', 'see', 'must', 'something', 'damn', 'wrong', 'thought', 'could', 'disney', 'chance', 'revive', 'back', 'former', 'glory', 'way', 'reason', 'rush', 'see', 'frozen', 'cinema', 'annoy', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'two', 'young', 'sister', 'sing', 'song', 'repeatedly', 'make', 'go', 'crazy', 'watch', 'hop', 'could', 'reach', 'supposedly', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'quality', 'nothing', 'okay', 'bad', 'film', 'fine', 'compare', 'animate', 'film', 'still', 'see', 'disney', 'animation', 'study', 'still', 'top', 'ladder', 'regard', 'animation', 'see', 'dreamworks', 'blue', 'sky', 'studio', 'creep', 'disney', 'pixar', 'back', 'quality', 'film', 'pixar', 'however', 'still', 'hold', 'however', 'disney', 'level', 'compare', 'past', 'animate', 'film', 'quite', 'disappoint', 'frozen', 'two', 'sister', 'princess', 'elsa', 'power', 'manipulate', 'snow', 'ice', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'anna', 'question', 'elsa', 'shuts', 'little', 'fight', 'elsa', 'set', 'kingdom', 'internal', 'winter', 'storyline', 'completely', 'rush', 'really', 'epic', 'journey', 'across', 'snow', 'feel', 'character', 'youwill', 'surprised', 'many', 'plot', 'hole', 'unanswered', 'question', 'film', 'note', 'read', 'snow', 'queen', 'story', 'base', 'develop', 'character', 'actual', 'story', 'focus', 'depth', 'character', 'character', 'really', 'forgettable', 'try', 'new', 'different', 'past', 'disney', 'animation', 'movie', 'really', 'come', 'awkward', 'thought', 'tangle', 'able', 'pull', 'well', 'think', 'try', 'hard', 'surprised', 'get', 'lot', 'acclaim', 'yet', 'tangle', 'get', 'little', 'amount', 'recognition', 'part', 'disappointed', 'really', 'climax', 'villain', 'disney', 'film', 'usually', 'bad', 'guy', 'play', 'huge', 'part', 'film', 'sadly', 'film', 'try', 'focus', 'connection', 'two', 'sister', 'whole', 'entire', 'film', 'rush', 'connection', 'obliviously', 'fails', 'oh', 'forgot', 'build', 'villain', 'everyone', 'like', 'villain', 'disney', 'film', 'frozen', 'try', 'pull', 'unexpected', 'bad', 'guy', 'twist', 'attempt', 'focus', 'character', 'see', 'development', 'villain', 'villain', 'complete', 'wimp', 'compare', 'others', 'villain', 'disney', 'film', 'bright', 'side', 'love', 'computer', 'animation', 'visuals', 'course', 'great', 'keep', 'improve', 'musical', 'number', 'okay', 'easily', 'unforgettable', 'musical', 'number', 'sound', 'personally', 'would', 'love', 'disney', 'return', 'back', 'animation', 'root', 'ad', 'least', 'try', 'pull', 'animation', 'like', 'disney', 'short', 'film', 'paperman', 'one', 'favourite', 'short', 'film', 'disney', 'time', 'overall', 'film', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'well', 'animate', 'film', 'make', 'today', 'get', 'lot', 'hype', 'hope', 'disney', 'eventually', 'redeem', 'good', 'storytelling']","[5, 2, 21, 311, 530, 229, 852, 535, 2269, 51, 184, 1027, 350, 2, 465, 10, 20, 54, 924, 269, 5, 507, 3212, 350, 152, 97, 327, 72, 2343, 16, 35, 96, 34, 16, 236, 89, 1480, 280, 92, 54, 2, 632, 3306, 74, 1662, 1619, 50, 180, 525, 16, 5, 543, 238, 30, 13, 11, 42, 73, 15, 63, 11, 2872, 14, 13, 1008, 23, 840, 54, 1046, 1290, 2, 465, 283, 156, 420, 65, 3, 470, 350, 38, 3, 68, 16, 2, 21, 2084, 68, 239, 5223, 902, 21, 16, 1035, 991, 1395, 311, 2, 194, 74, 283, 3, 194, 110, 68, 655, 110, 2, 440, 350, 276, 38, 3, 124, 808, 5, 42, 15, 29, 4, 24, 1343, 39, 33, 73, 15, 7, 7, 824, 4, 2878, 48, 816, 4, 144, 77, 1517, 105, 295, 291, 525, 22, 566, 337, 1168, 39, 53, 8, 703, 61, 52, 697, 2365, 824, 3, 625, 547, 39, 49, 12, 256, 917, 8, 815, 12, 261, 609, 8, 8, 22, 660, 87, 108, 140, 276, 2, 21, 1, 22, 40, 810, 92, 83, 294, 695, 18, 37, 87, 307, 703, 19, 84, 1942, 182, 83, 19, 48, 624, 2269, 94, 476, 22, 792, 104, 2, 3, 460, 65, 148, 204, 360, 94, 3, 1670, 3, 87, 261, 1189, 42, 15, 127, 264, 3, 525, 1189, 1052, 425, 1557, 202, 104, 109, 9, 104, 2, 3, 5, 87, 695, 894, 65, 148, 129, 448, 261, 8, 16, 356, 104, 104, 656, 4145, 350, 247, 104, 2, 3, 1425, 387, 6, 642, 21, 267, 228, 25, 154, 1864, 51, 184, 420, 403, 1510, 51, 184, 259, 520, 26, 6, 2, 385, 74, 21, 885, 2463, 250, 87, 695, 21, 9, 2, 263, 3, 3664, 10, 622, 263, 3, 2, 20, 166, 3, 403, 660, 18, 38, 3, 14, 674, 19, 84, 406, 384, 2, 652, 1199, 17, 689]"
1039,9,"Frozen, Disney's newest animated film directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee has been a box office success with its Oscar winning musical extravaganza. A magical snow queen, ambitious yet rambunctious princess, humorous snowman, along with other characters, come together to save a kingdom and mend the broken relationship between two royal sisters. The princess fairy-tale based on Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"", began in the fictional Scandinavian kingdom called Ardendelle with the eldest sister Elsa, voiced by Idena Mendel, who is born with the magical power of forming snow and ice at the touch of her hand. This gift becomes dangerous growing up due to a childhood accident she casts upon her little sister, Ana, which forces their parents to separate the two siblings damaging their relationship. As they continue to grow up, Ana voiced by Kristin Bell, insists on continuing their normal activities which introduced the classic Disney song, ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"". In result Elsa remains to isolate herself as a prisoner to her own room because her powers grow stronger which estranges the two siblings even further. As adolescents, the two princesses lose their parents to a shipwreck, leaving the two princesses behind to an isolated castle. This film's journey begins regarding the reveal of Elsa's hidden powers during her transformation to a Queen on her Coronation Day. Elsa accidentally sets off an eternal winter out of embarrassment and hides away in the icy mountains she creates. Ana, who is shocked and feels guilty, begins her journey to retrieve her sister to make things right between them and for the sake of the kingdom. Unlike other Disney princess movies, where the fairy-tale is based upon true love between a couple, Frozen exhibits the true love between two sisters. The movie carries important life lessons throughout its film from beginning to end, Disney's 'Frozen' will melt your heart. As mentioned, Frozen focuses on the relationship of siblings, which I extremely enjoyed. When Elsa exiles herself from the kingdom, she creates an ice palace in the mountains with her powers while letting go of her secret and restriction from her entire life. During this scene she expresses her feelings in the song titled, ""Let it Go"", which exhibits self-empowerment within herself by allowing herself the freedom and ability to be herself without compromise. This message tells the audience that it is OK to be yourself, if you accept yourself that is all that should matter. During this scene she also creates a snowman, named Olaf, who becomes the main humorous character of the film. Although Olaf is a live snowman, his character seemed believable, just as the rest of the humans in the film, due to his mild rude humor, curiosity, and ambition. When he is first introduced in the film, it seems as if he is an oblivious yet happy character, who later on reveals that he is smarter than the other characters think. He successfully helps the princesses and understands Ana's true feelings for a sledder named Kristoff. Kristoff, another main character voiced by Jonathon Groff, ultimately helped Ana locate Elsa in the ice palace of the mountains by a bribe. As he begins the film being annoyed of Ana, he later grows feelings for her during their journey to find Elsa. The dialogue between Elsa, Ana, Kristoff, and Olaf flowed perfectly as if realistic arguments and conversations would in real life. Internationally, Frozen has captured the heart and ears of people of all ages and cultures, including myself. I would recommend any person in need of a heart-warming, action-packed family comedy. It lives up to it's Oscar-Winning title, a movie that will certainly melt your heart.","['frozen', 'disney', 'new', 'animate', 'film', 'direct', 'chris', 'buck', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'box', 'office',

Think again. Surpassing several other movies made by the famous Disney Studios, Frozen is an original, heartwarming, and plain amazing animated movie with an excellent voice cast. Meet wonderful characters like heart-of-gold Anna, stunningly beautiful Elsa, courageous and determined Kristoff, and handsome and noble Hans. Oh, I can't forget Kristoff's faithful pet and buddy Sven and cheerful, optimistic, and comedic snowman Olaf, brought to life by Elsa. Enjoy amazing songs like ""Fixer-Upper'',''Will You Build A Snowman?'', and ""For the First Time in Forever''. Then there's the Oscar-winning, mind-blowing awesome song ''Let It Go''! Be on the lookout for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo appearance of Rapunzel and Flynn from Tangled, another awesome Disney musical. Although the plot may need some work, this is a movie you definitely don't want to miss. Oh, and Elsa was originally supposed to be the villain, but after listening to Let It Go, Disney changed the plot.","['remember', 'awesome', 'disney', 'musical', 'aladdin', 'cinderella', 'others', 'well', 'may', 'think', 'disney', 'make', 'movie', 'like', 'anymore', 'think', 'surpass', 'several', 'movie', 'make', 'famous', 'disney', 'studio', 'frozen', 'original', 'heartwarming', 'plain', 'amaze', 'animate', 'movie', 'excellent', 'voice', 'cast', 'meet', 'wonderful', 'character', 'like', 'heart', 'gold', 'anna', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'elsa', 'courageous', 'determine', 'kristoff', 'handsome', 'noble', 'han', 'oh', 'forget', 'kristoff', 'faithful', 'pet', 'buddy', 'sven', 'cheerful', 'optimistic', 'comedic', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'brought', 'life', 'elsa', 'enjoy', 'amaze', 'song', 'like', 'fixer', 'upper', 'build', 'snowman', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'oscar', 'win', 'mind', 'blowing', 'awesome', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'lookout', 'blink', 'miss', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'rapunzel', 'flynn', 'tangle', 'another', 'awesome', 'disney', 'musical', 'although', 'plot', 'may', 'need', 'work', 'movie', 'definitely', 'want', 'miss', 'oh', 'elsa', 'originally', 'suppose', 'villain', 'listen', 'let', 'go', 'disney', 'change', 'plot']","[391, 338, 2, 51, 485, 854, 247, 18, 171, 37, 2, 14, 1, 9, 892, 37, 1445, 608, 1, 14, 903, 2, 311, 5, 230, 803, 915, 96, 38, 1, 298, 86, 227, 244, 215, 8, 9, 80, 1920, 7, 3599, 93, 4, 3998, 993, 67, 739, 2541, 44, 425, 746, 67, 2561, 983, 3618, 181, 1638, 1268, 1043, 45, 32, 599, 79, 4, 91, 96, 11, 9, 772, 737, 202, 45, 36, 20, 287, 302, 374, 320, 2092, 338, 11, 30, 13, 4089, 271, 2221, 1225, 527, 1322, 83, 102, 338, 2, 51, 255, 52, 171, 99, 107, 1, 174, 59, 271, 425, 4, 1511, 473, 104, 531, 30, 13, 2, 209, 52]"
1041,6,"The problem with an earlier review that I posted ( which I have since removed) was its length. It was just too long. And I felt I was perhaps being too judgmental. Deep down, I actually wanted to more than ""tolerate"" Frozen. I wanted to like it/love it, around the level that I liked/loved Tangled. But alas. I couldn't. Go see this movie for the animation. Disney succeeds here, with the wintry wonderland of Arendelle. It is every bit as wonderful to look at visually, as Rapunzel's quaint, homey tower, town, and landscape. It is as breathtaking as the lush/creepiness of Brave's dark forest. The ice staircases and the ice palace that Elsa builds are worth seeing. Go see this movie for Olaf. He is a genuinely great character. His humor keeps this movie from sinking completely into melodrama. It's not his fault, that he makes this movie work. But you'll see that Olaf is the ""fixture"" and the ""glue.""My pet peeves in this movie are just mine. But, in my view, they put this movie well outside of the Disney Classics. First, there are the Broadway-esque songs. I know that the Lopez couple meant well, but the songs just really jar me out of immersing myself in the story. I'm well into enjoying the scene, and then the characters suddenly break into song, without any buildup. And the songs have way too much of a ""rock concert vibe to them"" (Love Is An Open Door), or they spend way too long in exposition, and bog down the action ( Do You Want To Build A Snowman, and For The First Time In Forever). Some songs are just pointless (Fixer-Upper), and leave one wondering why they didn't have the leads Kristoff and Anna sing a duet, instead? The only two songs that I did (sort of appreciate) were ""Let It Go"" by Elsa, and ""In Summer"" by Olaf. ""Let It Go"" is the best song in this movie. Idina Menzel belts out Elsa's frustrations and ultimate self-actualization in a tantalizing flurry of words. (However, the song didn't tug at my heart as Disney Classics ""Part of Your World"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" did.) ""In Summer"" is a funny ditty, and it captures the moment purely because it is ironic. A snowman who loves summer, but doesn't know he will melt. Cute. Other issues are still enough to make me not quite love this movie. The plot is kind of in-and-out. I'm supposed to appreciate that Disney is poking fun at the ""love at first sight gag,"" which is a major plot-line development in former Disney princess movies. However, I was a bit disgusted with the execution of it. I mean, I could read Hans from the minute he appeared on screen. That's not supposed to happen. I knew he was a greedy guy, and was further disgusted that he got a song with one of the heroines. Ick. It was no surprise ( to me) that he was the villain. Why? I guess, I can read people. But...even without that... no explanation was provided for his motives, except that he had too many siblings. Wow. That makes one into a conniving, merciless person? Well, I don't really buy that...but... um, whatever. The trolls, and the mom and dad were really stupidly written. I mean, telling your kid ( who has special powers/a gift) that they're the problem and a danger to everyone? On top of that, keep your kid isolated from everybody else, and train her to feel like less than a person? That's called child abuse where I come from. But I guess I'll put down the gavel. And while you're at it – sure – have some nearby trolls remove all of the memories that were crucial to the incident. That will set up everything for a wonderfully estranged relationship between siblings. I'm not certain whether I should applaud Disney for making it ""the love between sisters"" as the climax of the movie. I felt a little lost at that moment, in particular. I appreciated the gesture, but the way it transpired felt...too rushed and flimsy. I do wish that they had developed Anna's relationship with Kristoff more. Heck, they could have built-up Anna's relationship with Elsa more, before the ""magical, tie-up-a-bow ending."" So I don't like Frozen for the above reasons: underdeveloped plot, underdeveloped characters, quite a few songs that are a miss or are truly misplaced, and an overall message that is unsatisfying. There were too many what-ifs left in my head, after the screen went dark. And there you have it. Please have a nice Holiday Season!","['problem', 'earlier', 'review', 'post', 'since', 'remove', 'length', 'long', 'felt', 'perhaps', 'judgmental', 'deep', 'actually', 'want', 'tolerate', 'frozen',

1042,4,"Perhaps it is because I have had to grow up in a time where Frozen's overbearing merchandise has been thrust in my face for years, but this movie hasn't aged well for me. I used to like it so much the first year it came out, blinded by the good animation, flashy magic, and ear-worm music, but since then I have developed a pretty cynical nature towards the movie's existence.At the time of this movie's conception, I hadn't seen too many movies with magic where a good guy, or even a bad guy, could shoot some sort of magic from their hands and feet (I had not seen Avatar The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra yet). This is probably why me, and many other kids loved Elsa so much. I recall a video where a reviewer had said Elsa was ""The dress, the hair, and the song."" I would add her powers to this list. She is the ""straight man"" to Anna, who is bubbly and outgoing, which many kids love because they see her as a magic queen with cool hair and a catchy theme song, like a superhero (It is why I loved her at the time). I had neglected to realize that Elsa was effectively trying to stay away from Anna and never thinks to make amends with her only remaining family, that ""Let it Go"" (which I cannot listen to without hating) seemed to promote her liberation through living in solitude without telling anyone that cares about her, and that her primary emotion was fear. When Elsa is taken back to Arendelle, she tries to escape before even trying to fix her relationship with Anna, knowing full-well Anna is dying. Even if Elsa didn't know how to fix the ""eternal winter"" (which wasn't even that eternal), she should have made an attempt to console her sister in her final moments. I will admit that Elsa's serious behavior is part of her personality, and she doesn't think rationally (it must run in the family), but she has so little depth.Anna is not much better. She is very eccentric, bubbly, and weird, in a semi-charming way. She can be a bit naive, but that is a result of her circumstances of being sheltered and alone most of her life. Being alone is the worst thing for her, and she assumes it is the same for Elsa. While everyone needs some alone time, it is unhealthy to have no human interaction for so long. Anna and Elsa are just such extreme depictions of that. Anna is endearing, but she can be a bit obnoxious.I have no major problems with Kristoff, but I wish I knew more about him, or why he likes ice so much. He is a sweet and sarcastic man who loves his reindeer. His imagining he is talking to Sven like a stuffed animal is adorable and cheesy, since he is essentially in touch with his inner child.Olaf is a cute snowman who whispers his lines, his song is novel, and his joke about being impaled is hilarious (which sounds weird when I say it like that). I will say after ""In Summer"" is played over and over, you may like it less and less, but it is down to personal preference.The twist regarding Hans, while ridiculous in execution, is a good twist in concept. The twist regarding Anna saving herself is admittedly the best thing about the movie. Anna has been relying on other people the whole movie, so it makes sense for her, in the action of saving her sister, that she saves herself. However, immediately after, when she comes back to life, Elsa fixes everything with the power of love. I get what they were going for, but isn't her love for her sister and making sure Anna didn't get hurt the cause of the ""eternal winter""? The opposite of fear isn't love, it is bravery. The opposite of love is hate. This doesn't quite correlate.The songs are catchy, so it is understandable that people would love them so much. It also explains why people would hate them after certain ones being replayed over and over. ""Let it Go"" on its own is a nice song, but has been ruined by replaying. Most of the other songs are a bit annoying in some way except for ""Reindeers are Better Than People"", ""Vuelie"" (the choir song), and ""Frozen Heart""(the ice cutter song).I understand and appreciate certain aspects of this movie, and the impact it has had on future movies (especially the element of independence and sisterly relationships), but I cannot in good conscience say this itself is a great movie. The hype for this movie is unwarranted, and it makes me sad to say it. This could have been amazing. If you need something more like the Hans Christen Anderson story, I will direct you to Wizart's ""Snow Queen"" trilogy. Though its continuation is tenuous at best, and its budget is limited, its snowy atmosphere and darker tones and lack of musical numbers may be something you are looking for. It is technically a rip-off, but it says something when I would rather watch a rip-off than a Disney movie.","['perhaps', 'grow', 'time', 'frozen', 'overbear', 'merchandise', 'thrust', 'face', 'year',

Why do these haters sound so childish and pathetic? Why are you all being such cry babies, cause Elsa didn't get a love subject and it wasn't a prince who saved Anna and it was all about love between two siblings, and not the usual and classic prince and princess affair? Are you all upset because this time you got struck with surprise and that offended you somehow? What are you all, 12? Frozen was such a rare amazing experience for me because it really surprized me in all good ways. I'll defend this movie till the end even if i'm alone standing against negative crowd. You all should grow up. You want a classic love story ? Go watch Cinderella or something. But does it have to be the same with every movie Disney makes? Aren't you all bored already? I mean I love Beauty and the Beast, my fav, but Frozen was so special, it will always have a special place in my heart. Hands down it deserves whatever awards it's won. I'd even say this movie is underrated and not overrated as you claim.

1044,7,"Disney cannot seem to do much wrong these days. With Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm now under their wing, and billions of dollars rolling in as a result of those franchises, it's easy to forget that they were built on beautiful, groundbreaking hand-drawn animation that had children and adults alike utterly bewitched. With Pixar taking the lead as the modern-day innovators of animation, it's been a while since Disney delivered a 'cartoon' that really resonated with audiences on the level of, say, Dumbo (1941), The Jungle Book (1967) or The Lion King (1994). That all changed with Frozen, with the film raking in over $1 billion at the box office and receiving an Oscar for Best Animated Feature, as well as triumphing in the merchandise department. It's also now near-impossible to avoid hearing 'Let It Go' at Christmas time.In the land of Arandelle, sisters Elsa and Anna enjoy a close friendship, with Elsa possessing the powers to manipulate ice and turn the most miserable of rooms into a dream-like playground. They are also princesses living in a huge castle, with their much-loved parents ruling the land as they play. After Elsa accidentally injures her sister as they play in the snow, her parents take her to a group of trolls who heal her, but insist that her memories of Elsa's powers are wiped to protect her from future harm. Elsa agrees, and locks herself in her bedroom, shunning the confused and lonely Anna. Years later, the king and queen are lost at sea, so the town prepares for the Elsa's (voiced by Idina Menzel) coronation. With the soon-to-be-queen unable to control her powers, she flees Arandelle, leaving it frozen in her wake. With the Duke of Weselton (Alan Tudyk) hoping to seize power in her absence, Anna (Kristen Bell) goes in pursuit of her sister, with hunky ice trader Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his dopey reindeer for company.I was somewhat perplexed for the first third of Frozen. Early versions of the script had a more formulaic good sister vs bad sister dynamic, with an evil Elsa hijacking her sisters wedding and deliberately trying to kill her. The changes implemented were undoubtedly for the better, making for a much more interesting central relationship in the process, but this may also be the reason that several aspects are left unexplained. The origin of Elsa's powers raises the biggest question mark, with the film expecting the audience to simply accept her abilities as one of the quirks of a magical, fairytale land. Do we need a full explanation of how the princess can conjure an ice palace a la Dr. Manhattan and give life to goofy snowman Olaf (Josh Gad)? Well, no, but a little perspective would not be quite as jarring. The memory-erasing of Anna also seems somewhat harsh, with the extent of her injury never quite explored.Still, Frozen succeeds by taking a formula that has served Disney well for decades and tweaking it for a modern audience. Instead of a snarling bad guy, we get the conflicted Elsa, a young girl with unfathomable powers who plays the role of anti-hero on occasion. The central love story is not between a beautiful princess and a handsome hero, but between two sisters whose bond is stronger than any destructive power. While I'm sick to death of hearing Let It Go, the moment Menzel belts out the infectious tune during the film is a wonderful moment. The remainder of the songs aren't quite as catchy, but the lush animation proves to be a wonderful distraction, and the comic relief Olaf is a genuinely funny, incredibly weird creation. While it's no masterpiece or even a game-changer, Frozen has all the makings of a Disney classic (arguably it already is). While parents may say they don't make 'em quite like they used to, I remember hearing the same thing back in 1994 when I saw Simba earn his crown.","['disney', 'seem', 'much', 'wrong', 'day',

1045,6,"I really liked this movie but certain factors keep it from being the amazing and unforgettable Disney classic it most certainly could have been.I'll start with the good first because whats good about this movie really starts from the beginning.The animation is outstanding and definitely the best part of the movie. I'm not a CGI guy and when it comes to Disney I still crave and have the desire to once again see them revert to hand drawn animation they were oh so famous for. But my goodness, the animation in Frozen truly deserves praise and not once did it cross my mind that it would have been better if it was classically hand drawn. Characters are not only fluid in motion but facial expressions are spot on. From the way they talk and sing to the way they react with each other is just amazing to see. The whole setting is beautiful and and colors vibrant.Here comes the second best thing about this movie. Yes, everyone knows the show's famous for its songs, especially Menzel's ""Let it go"". Most of the songs are enjoyable and improve the experience but some I don't necessarily like. Ice workers song didn't hit me nor did "" Fixer upper"" but the rest were great.Spoilers ahead The story is what you'd expect if you've been keeping track of Disney. Pretty basic and that's not a bad thing. Funny at times an serious at others while still enjoyable and entertaining all throughout. The two main characters or who I think are the main characters, Anna and Elsa are both great and interesting but as for Kristoff, I can't say the same, there wasn't really anything I liked about him and he seemed super underdeveloped if you compare him to other characters one such as Flint Rider from Tangled,and I know a lot of people say their favorite character was the the snowman but I don't know if it was his voice or what but he was more creepy to me than funny and I normally like the little comic relief guys. But a big ""twist"" in the movie happened that I felt was completely misplaced and an extremely sloppy way of dealing with an issue the movie faced. I'm talking about Hans' sudden character change from a prince charming to the movies main antagonist. This was Disney's way of making Anna choose Kristoff instead of Hans (who I felt would have been a superb prince to add to Disney's list. We all knew Kristoff would ultimately be the one but the way it was done was unacceptable. The story should have been crafted in a way that Elsa and Kristoff would fall in love (seeing that Kristoff loves ice that wouldn't have been difficult) and then Anna and Hans. After completing the movie I felt that it just wasted my time when it was showing me the scenes with Anna with Hans and Hans searching for Elsa. I think a lot more could have been done in place of making Hans bad and them trying to stop him This just ruined the experience for me and prevents me from loving it as much as I wanted to.Some scenes were just so great I have to give this movie a positive review A 6 out of 10","['really', 'like', 'movie', 'certain', 'factor', 'keep', 'amaze', 'unforgettable', 'disney', 'classic', 'certainly', 'could', 'start', 'good', 'first', 'whats', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'start', 'begin', 'animation', 'outstanding', 'definitely', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'cgi', 'guy', 'come', 'disney', 'still', 'crave', 'desire', 'see', 'revert', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'oh', 'famous', 'goodness', 'animation', 'frozen', 'truly', 'deserves', 'praise', 'cross', 'mind', 'would', 'well', 'classically', 'hand', 'drawn', 'character', 'fluid', 'motion', 'facial', 'expression', 'spot', 'way', 'talk', 'sing', 'way', 'react', 'amaze', 'see', 'whole', 'set', 'beautiful', 'color', 'vibrant', 'come', 'second', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'yes', 'everyone', 'know', 'show', 'famous', 'song', 'especially', 'menzel', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'enjoyable', 'improve', 'experience', 'necessarily', 'like', 'ice', 'worker', 'song', 'hit', 'fixer', 'upper', 'rest', 'great', 'spoiler', 'ahead', 'story', 'expect', 'keep', 'track', 'disney', 'pretty', 'basic', 'bad', 'thing', 'funny', 'time', 'serious', 'others', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'entertain', 'throughout', 'two', 'main', 'character', 'think', 'main', 'character', 'anna', 'elsa', 'great', 'interest', 'kristoff', 'say', 'really', 'anything', 'like', 'seem', 'super', 'underdeveloped', 'compare', 'character', 'one', 'flint', 'rider', 'tangle', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'favorite', 'character', 'snowman', 'know', 'voice', 'creepy', 'funny', 'normally', 'like', 'little', 'comic', 'relief', 'guy', 'big', 'twist', 'movie', 'happen', 'felt', 'completely', 'misplace', 'extremely', 'sloppy', 'way', 'deal', 'issue', 'movie', 'face', 'talk', 'han', 'sudden', 'character', 'change', 'prince', 'charm', 'movie', 'main', 'antagonist', 'disney', 'way', 'make', 'anna', 'choose', 'kristoff', 'instead', 'han', 'felt', 'would', 'superb', 'prince', 'add', 'disney', 'list', 'knew', 'kristoff', 'would', 'ultimately', 'one', 'way', 'unacceptable', 'story', 'craft', 'way', 'elsa', 'kristoff', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'see', 'kristoff', 'love', 'ice', 'difficult', 'anna', 'han', 'complete', 'movie', 'felt', 'waste', 'time', 'show', 'scene', 'anna', 'han', 'han', 'search', 'elsa', 'think', 'lot', 'could', 'place', 'make', 'han', 'bad', 'try', 'stop', 'ruin', 'experience', 'prevents', 'love', 'much', 'want', 'scene', 'great', 'give', 'movie', 'positive', 'review']","[22, 9, 1, 563, 945, 154, 96, 1510, 2, 69, 442, 54, 120, 17, 36, 3397, 17, 1, 22, 120, 160, 21, 764, 174, 34, 94, 1, 555, 148, 40, 2, 68, 3760, 1070, 16, 3324, 323, 747, 21, 425, 903, 1754, 21, 5, 329, 592, 535, 1637, 320, 26, 18, 4449, 323, 747, 8, 3128, 1507, 1482, 1069, 1278, 50, 178, 63, 50, 2114, 96, 16, 127, 144, 93, 651, 1596, 40, 319, 34, 43, 1, 325, 109, 56, 78, 903, 11, 121, 116, 30, 13, 11, 306, 1864, 334, 1284, 9, 33, 3021, 11, 234, 772, 737, 303, 25, 419, 1270, 12, 131, 154, 932, 2, 136, 1088, 65, 43, 85, 20, 835, 247, 68, 306, 243, 296, 42, 119, 8, 37, 119, 8, 7, 4, 25, 122, 67, 35, 22, 212, 9, 75, 998, 2089, 350, 8, 10, 3054, 83, 56, 84, 46, 35, 189, 8, 45, 56, 86, 3969, 85, 1297, 9, 48, 309, 297, 148, 106, 129, 1, 290, 155, 291, 3978, 423, 2111, 50, 701, 519, 1, 381, 178, 44, 1072, 8, 209, 82, 235, 1, 119, 634, 2, 50, 14, 7, 1672, 67, 208, 44, 155, 26, 904, 82, 269, 2, 550, 488, 67, 26, 941, 10, 50, 12, 1021, 50, 4, 67, 26, 186, 6, 16, 67, 6, 33, 1113, 7, 44, 656, 1, 155, 644, 20, 78, 90, 7, 44, 44, 793, 4, 37, 84, 54, 188, 14, 44, 65, 87, 284, 851, 334, 3057, 6, 31, 59, 90, 25, 57, 1, 503, 161]"

Best music from Disney since The Lion King.Frozen has all the best things about Disney movies but with one great twist. the love story is about Elsa and Anna and the bond of sisters. No matter how much Elsa pushes Anna away Anna never gives up. This is based on The Snow Queen but only very loosely. There are a few jokes that older teens and adults will get but will go over the heads of younger ones.At the core of Frozen is love in all it's forms but especially the love of family. It also celebrates being true to yourself and being yourself.

Frozen feels like it should have been a television special on the old Sunday night Disney show or a direct to video release.Frozen was still an enjoyable movie, but it did not feel in any way like a big budget film from a company that has a reputation for great films. The script was average, the characters were not fleshed out (like Nemo and Aerial were -- for example) and it just did not feel like the movie was well constructed. The snowman takes away from the film almost as much as Jar Jar Binks did in Star Wars -- he was an unnecessary character with no purpose at all.This film does not aim for the entire family like the Disney/Pizar films of past, but shoots straight for the little children.

1049,8,"Once again, the artists and writers of Walt Disney Animation Studios have outdone themselves with their 53rd animation feature, the amazing Frozen (2013). An enchanting combination of fairy-tale, fantasy, humour, songs and of course the traditional happy ending, Frozen carves another heart-warming and inspirational Disney animation. Although the picture expected a success, its expectations were massively surpassed, of course in the best way possible. Anticipating a $250-300 million box office revenue upon its opening, the movie passed over $300 domestically and another $343 million worldwide. In its sixth week of release, the film remarkably revisited the No1 spot in the Box Office. Fully enjoying and engaging in the Disney epic, I understand the reasons for this phenomenal success.One of the reasons being the inspiring and heartening narrative. Having accidentally hurt her younger sister, Anna, as a child with her icy magical powers, Princess Elsa is forced to isolate herself from her sister (and the rest of the world) and hide her powers in fear of further harm. However through an accidental use of her powers during a heated discussion with her sister, Elsa causes an outbreak of an eternal winter and is sent into exile. With help from the hilarious talking sidekick snowman Olaf and others, Anna is in pursuit of her older sister.Decorated with a dazzling digital palette, which creates a stunning framework for action, this is a highly enjoyable, romantic, engaging and exhilarating feature for all the family. Additionally, I could not ignore the relatable storyline of an older sister who grows up and shuns her younger sister. This is a familiar dynamic to any child who has had an older sister or friend. Further, the film is about growing up; something Disney is very good at portraying. Growing up, becoming your own person and learning not to be ashamed of who you are. A requirement for Disney, and other animated kids movies is the hilarious irreverent sidekick. Frozen's is in the form of a chatty snowman is adorable and his antics are genuinely funny – the character to cause most giggles from me personally. In his Summer song while fantasising about all the fun he would have in the warm weather is incredibly witty as he is completely oblivious that he would melt in reality. Mentioning the Frozen songs, they are pretty good. Although I'm sure they could get annoyingly catchy, they are witty and utterly predictable. Being a huge fan and lover to Disney my whole life, I was expecting to love their captivating blockbuster Frozen. It most definitely lived up to my Disney belief as I was completely engaged in the movie. I loved and enjoyed every moment. As well as the amazing visuals and animation, the characters, dialogue and songs combined created a remarkably heart- warming, encouraging and hilarious picture.","['artist', 'writer', 'walt', 'disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'outdone', 'rd', 'animation', 'feature', 'amaze', 'frozen', 'enchant', 'combination', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fantasy', 'humour', 'song', 'course', 'traditional', 'happy', 'end', 'frozen', 'carves', 'another', 'heart', 'warm', 'inspirational', 'disney', 'animation', 'although', 'picture', 'expect', 'success', 'expectation', 'massively', 'surpass', 'course', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'anticipate', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'revenue', 'upon', 'opening', 'movie', 'pass', 'domestically', 'another', 'million', 'worldwide', 'sixth', 'week', 'release', 'film', 'remarkably', 'revisit', 'spot', 'box', 'office', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'engage', 'disney', 'epic', 'understand', 'reason', 'phenomenal', 'success', 'one', 'reason', 'inspire', 'hearten', 'narrative', 'accidentally', 'hurt', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'child', 'icy', 'magical', 'power', 'princess', 'elsa', 'force', 'isolate', 'sister', 'rest', 'world', 'hide', 'power', 'fear', 'far', 'harm', 'however', 'accidental', 'use', 'power', 'heat', 'discussion', 'sister', 'elsa', 'cause', 'outbreak', 'eternal', 'winter', 'sent', 'exile', 'help', 'hilarious', 'talk', 'sidekick', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'others', 'anna', 'pursuit', 'old', 'sister', 'decorate', 'dazzle', 'digital', 'palette', 'creates', 'stun', 'framework', 'action', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'romantic', 'engage', 'exhilarate', 'feature', 'family', 'additionally', 'could', 'ignore', 'relatable', 'storyline', 'old', 'sister', 'grows', 'shuns', 'young', 'sister', 'familiar', 'dynamic', 'child', 'old', 'sister', 'friend', 'far', 'film', 'grow', 'something', 'disney', 'good', 'portray', 'grow', 'become', 'person', 'learn', 'ashamed', 'requirement', 'disney', 'animate', 'kid', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'irreverent', 'sidekick', 'frozen', 'form', 'chatty', 'snowman', 'adorable', 'antic', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'character', 'cause', 'giggle', 'personally', 'summer', 'song', 'fantasise', 'fun', 'would', 'warm', 'weather', 'incredibly', 'witty', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'would', 'melt', 'reality', 'mention', 'frozen', 'song', 'pretty', 'good', 'although', 'sure', 'could', 'get', 'annoyingly', 'catchy', 'witty', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'huge', 'fan', 'lover', 'disney', 'whole', 'life', 'expect', 'love', 'captivate', 'blockbuster', 'frozen', 'definitely', 'live', 'disney', 'belief', 'completely', 'engage', 'movie', 'love', 'enjoy', 'every', 'moment', 'well', 'amaze', 'visuals', 'animation', 'character', 'dialogue', 'song', 'combine', 'create', 'remarkably', 'heart', 'warm', 'encourage', 'hilarious', 'picture']","[1886, 605, 410, 2, 21, 311, 5217, 2148, 21, 229, 96, 5, 615, 1414, 219, 114, 545, 732, 11, 228, 462, 301, 41, 5, 3652, 102, 80, 362, 2773, 2, 21, 255, 438, 131, 577, 452, 2984, 1445, 228, 34, 50, 673, 2075, 965, 598, 717, 3228, 554, 631, 1, 1122, 102, 965, 1953, 4199, 1078, 288, 3, 2673, 2714, 1278, 598, 717, 822, 91, 619, 2, 566, 216, 180, 1583, 577, 10, 180, 500, 4378, 802, 300, 305, 73, 15, 7, 70, 453, 170, 24, 29, 4, 272, 1438, 15, 303, 126, 676, 24, 187, 142, 709, 110, 2826, 158, 24, 1601, 2831, 15, 4, 328, 310, 105, 1606, 1602, 135, 364, 178, 436, 45, 32, 247, 7, 2553, 64, 15, 4556, 1786, 1572, 5210, 797, 315, 345, 472, 306, 393, 619, 3717, 229, 72, 3207, 54, 1079, 884, 295, 64, 15, 1291, 5149, 73, 15, 1077, 988, 70, 64, 15, 327, 142, 3, 285, 89, 2, 17, 1018, 285, 179, 441, 347, 2279, 2451, 2, 38, 60, 1, 364, 436, 5, 427, 45, 687, 2551, 1882, 85, 8, 328, 1388, 520, 205, 11, 125, 26, 362, 986, 603, 1216, 291, 2758, 26, 359, 940, 348, 5, 11, 136, 17, 255, 207, 54, 19, 3022, 266, 1216, 1209, 331, 360, 176, 1350, 2, 127, 79, 131, 6, 1024, 1875, 5, 174, 224, 2, 1796, 291, 619, 1, 6, 91, 115, 133, 18, 96, 267, 21, 8, 719, 11, 1096, 134, 2673, 80, 362, 1657, 364, 438]"
1050,7,"While I'll admit that Frozen is much better than Tangled and Brave, I do find it a little overrated than everyone else does. Let me explain why? My biggest problem with this movie is the villain. Hans wasn't horrible but I felt he would've been a better villain sidekick than the main villain. Another problem is that the story relied too much on the ""true love saves the day"" cliché at the end of the movie.But there are still some good parts of the movie. The other characters are funny and very interesting, the animation was pretty good, and the music was great (except for that one song sung by the trolls, which I found to be pretty pointless). I especially liked the character of Elsa and Anna and their relationship together.All in all, I found the movie good, but not great as everyone says it is. What it lacks is a feeling of grand-scale epic-ness that other Disney films had like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame had. But I still recommend Frozen as a great musical, because that part worked very well in this story.","['admit', 'frozen', 'much', 'well', 'tangle', 'brave', 'find', 'little', 'overrate', 'everyone', 'else', 'let', 'explain', 'big', 'problem', 'movie', 'villain', 'han', 'horrible', 'felt', 'would', 'well', 'villain', 'sidekick', 'main', 'villain', 'another', 'problem', 'story', 'rely', 'much', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'day', 'clich', 'end', 'movie', 'still', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'character', 'funny', 'interest', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'music', 'great', 'except', 'one', 'song', 'sung', 'troll', 'found', 'pretty', 'pointless', 'especially', 'like', 'character', 'elsa', 'anna', 'relationship', 'together', 'found', 'movie', 'good', 'great', 'everyone', 'say', 'lack', 'feel', 'grand', 'scale', 'epic', 'ness', 'disney', 'film', 'like', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'hunchback', 'notre', 'dame', 'still', 'recommend', 'frozen', 'great', 'musical', 'part', 'work', 'well', 'story']","[637, 5, 31, 18, 83, 335, 71, 48, 426, 109, 270, 30, 400, 106, 198, 1, 104, 44, 896, 155, 26, 18, 104, 436, 119, 104, 102, 198, 12, 1299, 31, 62, 6, 111, 138, 274, 41, 1, 68, 17, 94, 1, 8, 85, 122, 21, 136, 17, 58, 25, 474, 10, 11, 684, 123, 231, 136, 898, 121, 9, 8, 4, 7, 153, 332, 231, 1, 17, 25, 109, 35, 273, 53, 936, 1827, 566, 2782, 2, 3, 9, 149, 203, 152, 97, 1524, 1525, 1453, 68, 262, 5, 25, 51, 94, 107, 18, 12]"
1051,6,"As many of viewers of this animation I enjoyed watching it. Probably from here most of the Disney's animators and their project leaders should take few pointers. As a blockbuster (especially from Disney)the animation should be expected much better than 2 sister characters, well made and drawn,and their dresses. Most of the other world around them looked very plain, snow is going to put some plainness, but when characters move through it, the trail is very unimpressive. Anyways, there are much more detailed characters that are drawn in the gaming world and one games many characters are much more detailed with the budget smaller than this movie. Animators: look at final fantasy 13 and you will appreciate character details, also areas around them. It begs the question if Disney is settling for middle standards or lack of talent in their animator divisions. There is of course differences between game and full flagged movie, but once the character is created the rest is making them move on set backgrounds. One more thing, I got the impression that character eyes are a little cross eyed. Good effort, but this kind of scale movie has to do better on animation and story has to be more interesting, especially for fairy tales of this scale.","['many', 'viewer', 'animation', 'enjoy', 'watch', 'probably', 'disney', 'animator', 'project', 'leader', 'take', 'pointer', 'blockbuster', 'especially', 'disney', 'animation', 'expect', 'much', 'well', 'sister', 'character', 'well', 'make', 'drawn', 'dress', 'world', 'around', 'look', 'plain', 'snow', 'go', 'put', 'plainness', 'character', 'move', 'trail', 'unimpressive', 'anyways', 'much', 'detailed', 'character', 'drawn', 'game', 'world', 'one', 'game', 'many', 'character', 'much', 'detailed', 'budget', 'small', 'movie', 'animator', 'look', 'final', 'fantasy', 'appreciate', 'character', 'detail', 'also', 'area', 'around', 'begs', 'question', 'disney', 'settle', 'middle', 'standard', 'lack', 'talent', 'animator', 'division', 'course', 'difference', 'game', 'full', 'flag', 'movie', 'character', 'create', 'rest', 'make', 'move', 'set', 'background', 'one', 'thing', 'get', 'impression', 'character', 'eye', 'little', 'cross', 'eyed', 'good', 'effort', 'kind', 'scale', 'movie', 'well', 'animation', 'story', 'interest', 'especially', 'fairy', 'tale', 'scale']","[61, 479, 21, 91, 23, 210, 2, 812, 1020, 1621, 55, 4994, 1875, 121, 2, 21, 131, 31, 18, 15, 8, 18, 14, 747, 907, 126, 200, 66, 915, 39, 13, 196, 8, 242, 1292, 31, 1488, 8, 747, 925, 126, 10, 925, 61, 8, 31, 1488, 1351, 601, 1, 812, 66, 817, 545, 699, 8, 468, 27, 1266, 200, 5070, 824, 2, 2037, 962, 633, 273, 800, 812, 5221, 228, 1164, 925, 246, 4456, 1, 8, 134, 303, 14, 242, 144, 617, 10, 43, 19, 1118, 8, 336, 48, 1637, 1814, 17, 575, 193, 1827, 1, 18, 21, 12, 122, 121, 219, 114, 1827]"

Elsa is an interesting character with a certain aura and personality that actually made me believe that this movie was going to be one of the better animated movies ever. The whole build-up is interesting and the music is top notch. And just as you reach the climax everything just turns cliché. Hans, the prince that asked Anna to marry him 12 hours ago turns out to be evil and just said the things he did so he would get a shot at the throne. The whole curse that was put on Anna is just a bunch of Mumbo-Jumbo since one little hug, and a few tears, from Elsa just thaws her up again. And Kristoff that rold Anna that you can't just fall in love after a single day does just that and falls in love with Anna. The trolls could have been so much more important to the plot, but instead they just acted as some marriage-crazy singers.

1053,8,"(Elsa = Disney.)Hi, this is another Disney big fan and a Frozen spectator. Mega-charmed by this movie, soaked up in the soundtracks of it. Sorry for coming up with such a sudden conclusion of my own at the top of the review, but that was the way I felt or thought along and after seeing the movie. Elsa stands for Disney and the whole movie is an homage to/resolution of Disney. Let me explain.1) Elsa is only deuteragonist. Elsa sung the most popular number of the soundtrack and she is super fascinating; however still, Anna is the heroine. Anna is more risk-taking and courageous than snow queen Elsa. Not only does she take the responsibilities of caring after the people of Arendelle in the place of her sister; but moreover, she is the one who keeps trying to fix the relationship and who makes friends and goes on a journey with them: The rules of past Disney princesses. She knew how to receive the helps she was given gratefully, while Elsa locked herself up in the fear till the end of the story. Not that Disney's schizoid or a sorcerer-but just to note that Elsa such a fascinating character must be something other than a protagonist then.2) Frozen is like a total exhibition of pieces of Disney. Um, plus, other works of masterpieces, too. This is seemingly insensible, but could make sense if we try. The scenes in Frozen are recalling of their matching scenes in other Disney films: Anna caressing chicks in her hands and Anna and Hans sitting on the roof are Jasmine petting larks and Aladdin and Jasmine sitting on the roof of a Chinese palace. Wolves chasing the sleigh of Kristoff reminds of The Beauty and the Beast. Olaf doing the tap dance in hat with an umbrella in his hand is Bert dancing with penguins on the date out with Mary Poppins. And seriously, that uncanny scream of village people when Olaf slides away down in town and his floundering on the snow cannot be anything else but a replica of The Nightmare before the Christmas! (Yes, Disney was interested in skeletal images and Tim Burton made the animation before he LEFT the Disney-that means he once belonged there.) To broaden to O.S.T., the primitive religious song at the entry and ending of the movie? The Lion King's. To sum up, Frozen is an all-comprising piece of Disney.3) Elsa has a reserved personality, and was born to be a queen and born icy-powered. Well I wrote that Elsa could be something more than a mere deuteragonist: she does not show as often as Anna, but she is actually everywhere in the form of snowy background and weathers. Elsa does not express her feeling emotionally but rather express them in solid forms; like ice. Cause she can make ice. Differentiated from other princesses, for the first time in forever, Elsa shows endeavor to behave as to be becoming of a queen and does not complain about putting aside fun parts of life (say, loving). I don't know if Disney suddenly changed their message from Be brave and be princessy to Girls be ambitious and pursue your career, or if it's the result of sudden change of her character from evil to good, supposedly. Any way it may be, she looks satisfied with her dictatorship. And females are fanatic about it. I'll go on and try to sum up those in my conclusion.While Anna show her human virtue as a heroine of the movie Frozen, Elsa seems to function as a fantasizing, yet unreachable existence. Unconscious reflection of self of Disney by the creators; that was my instinctive impression. Disney is a one top production of animated movies; moreover, they're very fond of their own creatures. Also very proud. (Look up on Youtube and you can find in many videos that Disney uses their own accumulated works and only their works as sources of later movies' moves and expressions. Also there are many characters or hidden logos of themselves in their films; like Goofy in The Little Mermaid.) Here's the point. I like Disney, as a creator of original and childlike pictures, all together with his old and odd works (e.x. Skeleton Dance, Silly Symphony) and actually started missing those less didactic styles. As this new movie of Disney is great in graphics but a bit short on story, I thought the whole movie and the way it depicted Elsa was its resolution to well finish up its 90s renaissance style and test their limit and break through once again!--- Please understand I may have different point of view as I have different cultural and personal background, and that I am not strong in English and organized writing either. Honestly I was afraid my writing gets even messier if I contain more materials in it. I'm just hugely interested in Disney films and Walt Disney. –Personally I was a bit upset people are beaming more light on Elsa when we finally have the most sympathetic and human princess ever. But women are being attracted by this most un-Disney-like lady ever. (They never depicted women as real independent protagonist before. Think it was possible because there left some traces of her character's transformation. one very interesting happening for me.) –In general, I think Disney being accused of using its fandom to hit with this movie is fair. The plot is weakly built. I think Disney intended this movie to be one of their cornerstones or a masterpiece. But, I'll stay frozen for a while. -I've got so much more to write about on other aspects, among them the modernity or the musical numbers, but I only wrote about Elsa and how it reminded me of Disney. I think Disney is really going to be rendered a new kind of canon, and still always stay modern. -I don't even have a room for Elsa's sexuality.","['elsa', 'disney', 'hi', 'another', 'disney', 'big',

However the real selling point of Frozen is that it has intricacies not seen in other Disney films. In particular the character of Elsa is a complicated but easily adored character who will be the one that teenagers in ten years time will look back and only then appreciate the brilliance. As well as this there are the obligatory jokes for the parents and just adult Disney-lovers which keep this family film family friendly!

1055,6,"The first half hour of Frozen had several moments that had me rolling my eyes and groaning out loud. (ex. Anna:""What's that smell?"" Elsa: ""Smells like..."" Both: ""CHOCOLATE!"" Ugh.) It's like Disney forgot how to make a family film that doesn't annoy the parents who've taken their kids to see it.But about that contrivance. Here's the thing, and here's where the spoilers begin: Elsa has the supreme powers of an almighty deity. Without ever receiving any training or guidance at all, or even any practice, she can perfectly and effortlessly: freeze any object, create ice out of nothing, telepathically control the ice she creates, telepathically control wood and coal, control the wind, transform her dress into a completely different dress made from completely different material and of a completely different style, create sentient life out of inanimate objects, and bring people back from the dead. Oh, but she can't thaw out the stuff she's frozen. Well she can, technically, but, for some reason the movie leaves entirely unexplained, this minor detail isn't as effortlessly intuitive to her as every single other aspect of her power is. The trolls who heal Anna at the beginning know exactly how Elsa's power works. They explain to her that fear will cause her to lose control of her power and, several years later, they tell Anna that only love can thaw a frozen heart, meaning love allows Elsa to undo what her powers do. WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL ELSA THAT WHEN SHE WAS A KID?!? Because then there'd have been no movie, that's why.So Elsa spends the next decade locked away in her room because her parents are too stupid to understand that you can't learn to control something unless you're actually allowed to use it. What follows is a story that, while entertaining, has been so shoehorned into place that you can't help but feel a little cheated. Especially at the end, when Elsa's expression of ""true love"" brings Anna back from the dead. Her love thaws Anna's frozen heart. Except that the emotion she was expressing was grief. You know, the same emotion that didn't heal Anna at all when Elsa iced her at the beginning of the movie. But somehow, this little revelation is all Elsa needed to instantly master the aspect of her power that until then had completely eluded her for her entire life.The snowman was funny though, and the songs were good. That's three stars each.","['first', 'half', 'hour', 'frozen', 'several', 'moment', 'roll', 'eye', 'groan', 'loud', 'ex', 'anna', 'smell', 'elsa', 'smell', 'like', 'chocolate', 'ugh', 'like', 'disney', 'forgot', 'make', 'family', 'film', 'annoy', 'parent', 'take', 'kid', 'see', 'contrivance', 'thing', 'spoiler', 'begin', 'elsa', 'supreme', 'power', 'almighty', 'deity', 'without', 'ever', 'receive', 'training', 'guidance', 'even', 'practice', 'perfectly', 'effortlessly', 'freeze', 'object', 'create', 'ice', 'nothing', 'telepathically', 'control', 'ice', 'creates', 'telepathically', 'control', 'wood', 'coal', 'control', 'wind', 'transform', 'dress', 'completely', 'different', 'dress', 'make', 'completely', 'different', 'material', 'completely', 'different', 'style', 'create', 'sentient', 'life', 'inanimate', 'object', 'bring', 'people', 'back', 'dead', 'oh', 'thaw', 'stuff', 'frozen', 'well', 'technically', 'reason', 'movie', 'leaf', 'entirely', 'unexplained', 'minor', 'detail', 'effortlessly', 'intuitive', 'every', 'single', 'aspect', 'power', 'troll', 'heal', 'anna', 'begin', 'know', 'exactly', 'elsa', 'power', 'work', 'explain', 'fear', 'cause', 'lose', 'control', 'power', 'several', 'year', 'later', 'tell', 'anna', 'love', 'thaw', 'frozen', 'heart', 'meaning', 'love', 'allows', 'elsa', 'undo', 'power', 'tell', 'elsa', 'kid', 'movie', 'elsa', 'spends', 'next', 'decade', 'lock', 'away', 'room', 'parent', 'stupid', 'understand', 'learn', 'control', 'something', 'unless', 'actually', 'allow', 'use', 'follow', 'story', 'entertain', 'shoehorn', 'place', 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'cheat', 'especially', 'end', 'elsa', 'expression', 'true', 'love', 'brings', 'anna', 'back', 'dead', 'love', 'thaw', 'anna', 'frozen', 'heart', 'except', 'emotion', 'express', 'grief', 'know', 'emotion', 'heal', 'anna', 'elsa', 'iced', 'begin', 'movie', 'somehow', 'little', 'revelation', 'elsa', 'need', 'instantly', 'master', 'aspect', 'power', 'completely', 'elude', 'entire', 'life', 'snowman', 'funny', 'though', 'song', 'good', 'three', 'star']","[36, 346, 487, 5, 608, 133, 985, 336, 3334, 798, 1943, 7, 5229, 4, 5229, 9, 1779, 2334, 9, 2, 1557, 14, 72, 3, 238, 118, 55, 60, 16, 5105, 43, 419, 160, 4, 24, 4871, 137, 81, 852, 3981, 3317, 28, 3220, 456, 2488, 282, 1491, 134, 33, 156, 5230, 128, 33, 797, 5230, 128, 1296, 128, 848, 2004, 907, 291, 140, 907, 14, 291, 140, 1080, 291, 140, 355, 134, 3083, 79, 5231, 1491, 221, 46, 74, 831, 425, 775, 698, 5, 18, 1790, 180, 1, 586, 1083, 1401, 670, 468, 2488, 4453, 115, 741, 443, 24, 123, 1234, 7, 160, 56, 522, 4, 24, 107, 400, 187, 328, 489, 128, 24, 608, 47, 358, 143, 7, 6, 775, 5, 80, 672, 6, 1671, 4, 2513, 24, 143, 4, 60, 1, 4, 1673, 418, 492, 382, 101, 506, 118, 494, 216, 347, 128, 89, 959, 103, 833, 158, 378, 12, 243, 5163, 188, 135, 53, 48, 2522, 121, 41, 4, 1069, 62, 6, 509, 7, 74, 831, 6, 775, 7, 5, 80, 474, 240, 1099, 3305, 56, 240, 1234, 7, 4, 2724, 160, 1, 981, 48, 1833, 4, 99, 1498, 1837, 443, 24, 291, 4430, 264, 79, 45, 85, 100, 11, 17, 433, 249]"
1056,8,"After the halcyon days of Disney dwindled over (I'm talking, of course, about the renaissance of Disney Princess films that the public was graced with throughout the decade of the 90s) the corporation was not short on funds, but short on exceptionally compelling ideas. We were beginning to see the same Disney recipe tailored to another generic Disney character who shares the same values and beliefs as Disney characters who preceded him/her, and the result was pretty underwhelming. The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, and Brave all told their own 'cutesy' story of big dreams and high hopes, but Frozen offers us something more substantial.Frozen seems to parody Disney's former blueprint for a successful Disney Princess film by giving us what we're used to from the outset: a coming- of-age tale (although this time it is centered around two sisters), the death of the parents (who were already dead by telling their daughter to 'conceal, don't feel'), the romantic interest, and a reversal of a spell by an 'act of true love.' 'Let it Go' is, arguably, the most empowering song ever sung by any Disney Princess (or any female character, for that matter) and teaches the lesson that it's okay for things to change and it's okay to be alone-- you don't need a kingdom, a man, and all the riches of the world to be happy. 'The past is just the past' and 'that perfect girl is gone,' and the liberated self is introduced. There are a lot of things that just 'work' with Frozen, and a lot of nods and friendly acknowledgements from Disney's creative team implicitly lodged in the film, as well. The absence of diversity is still present, the lust for a fully-realized romance is still central to the plot (Brave did better at this), but the Princesses do appear to have grander superobjectives than do their predecessors. This is all arguable, however. Overall, this film is a ton of fun. Great voice talents, a very catchy OST, outspoken and strong female leads, and gorgeous animations actually make this one of the few Disney flicks that you want to be a moral educator.

Whether you grew up watching Snow White receiving true loves kiss from her handsome prince, Cinderella being fitted for her glass slipper, or Ariel yearning for the shore, these films undoubtedly had a profound effect on the way you view the world and your role in it. With this in mind, Frozen is a refreshing and wonderful story that focuses on connections between family members and the importance of trust and love within these relationships. The story highlights the ""true love"" found not only in romantic relationships but also in families (in this case between two sisters).It was so nice to see a movie that showed this kind of example to children rather than the traditional damsel in distress rescued by prince charming scenario. Every voice performance in the film is amazing. Particularly Idina Menzel who does the voice of Elsa. Her voice is powerful and precise throughout. My personal favorite, ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" is in itself an emotionally charged journey of melancholy and reflection. It was a one of the high points of a great film.I saw this movie with a group of family ages ranging from three to mid forties and every single one of us loved it. The first question after the movie from the younger kids was, ""So when can we watch it at home?"" I felt the same way. Disney has added another beloved classic to its repertoire, and simultaneously revolutionized the image of a princess and the notion of ""true love.""

1060,9,"Though not as inventive or as gorgeous as the fantastic ""Rise of The Guardians"", an animated film that didn't get as much recognition as it deserved, ""Frozen"" is way up there, especially after a couple of years that hasn't shown much in the way of storytelling. Films have been impressive in their presentation, but their tales have been, to say the least, a bit thin.Going back to sources that are close to ""The Little Mermaid"", is no coincidence that ""Frozen"" (loosely based on ""The Ice Queen"") gives us quite a charming film. The music is good, not on the level of ""Mermaid"", but good enough to support the film, to hum along with it, and is a good match to some gorgeous visuals, and three or four animated characters. I was particular impressed by Olaf and the two sisters, especially the Ice Queen, who had more depth, both in its animated portrayal and personality.The story tells us of the conflicts brought upon a pair of sisters, as one has the gift/curse of transforming her surroundings into a deadly combination of beauty and cold. People will admire the transformation but will also shiver because of the fairly realistic presentation of the power and harshness of this type of environment.An accident separates two sisters who love each other, and on the day of the older sister's coronation, an emotional outburst sets off one tragedy after another. Soon, the hero/heroine must find a way to bring everything back to normal; however it is pretty clear that it won't be an easy task, and most importantly, things are not always what they seem. The main idea here is that beauty is dangerous in one way or another.""Frozen"" is piece full of wonders, strikingly beautiful and with the ability to connect in many levels with both children and adults. We will all love Olaf and his innocence, will understand the need to restore the broken bond between the sisters, and will also yearn for the love that everyone wants in their lives.The film is very good.","['though', 'inventive', 'gorgeous', 'fantastic', 'rise', 'guardian', 'animate', 'film', 'get', 'much', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'frozen', 'way', 'especially', 'couple', 'year', 'show', 'much', 'way', 'storytelling', 'film', 'impressive', 'presentation', 'tale', 'say', 'least', 'bit', 'thin', 'go', 'back', 'source', 'close', 'little', 'mermaid', 'coincidence', 'frozen', 'loosely', 'base', 'ice', 'queen', 'give', 'u', 'quite', 'charm', 'film', 'music', 'good', 'level', 'mermaid', 'good', 'enough', 'support', 'film', 'hum', 'along', 'good', 'match', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'three', 'four', 'animate', 'character', 'particular', 'impressed', 'olaf', 'two', 'sister', 'especially', 'ice', 'queen', 'depth', 'animate', 'portrayal', 'personality', 'story', 'tell', 'u', 'conflict', 'brought', 'upon', 'pair', 'sister', 'one', 'gift', 'curse', 'transform', 'surroundings', 'deadly', 'combination', 'beauty', 'cold', 'people', 'admire', 'transformation', 'also', 'shiver', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'presentation', 'power', 'harshness', 'type', 'environment', 'accident', 'separate', 'two', 'sister', 'love', 'day', 'old', 'sister', 'coronation', 'emotional', 'outburst', 'set', 'one', 'tragedy', 'another', 'soon', 'hero', 'heroine', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'bring', 'everything', 'back', 'normal', 'however', 'pretty', 'clear', 'easy', 'task', 'importantly', 'thing', 'always', 'seem', 'main', 'idea', 'beauty', 'dangerous', 'one', 'way', 'another', 'frozen', 'piece', 'full', 'wonder', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'ability', 'connect', 'many', 'level', 'child', 'adult', 'love', 'olaf', 'innocence', 'understand', 'need', 'restore', 'broken', 'bond', 'sister', 'also', 'yearn', 'love', 'everyone', 'want', 'life', 'film', 'good']","[100, 1819, 444, 253, 880, 1768, 38, 3, 19, 31, 2269, 483, 5, 50, 121, 398, 47, 78, 31, 50, 689, 3, 933, 2852, 114, 35, 250, 95, 1306, 13, 74, 1092, 351, 48, 422, 3943, 5, 696, 256, 33, 49, 57, 177, 124, 235, 3, 58, 17, 440, 422, 17, 164, 740, 3, 1048, 172, 17, 553, 444, 267, 433, 784, 38, 8, 650, 947, 32, 42, 15, 121, 33, 49, 609, 38, 2669, 407, 12, 143, 177, 552, 599, 554, 1441, 15, 10, 832, 405, 2004, 3853, 2825, 1414, 149, 366, 46, 2270, 1772, 27, 3288, 890, 640, 2852, 24, 524, 1147, 480, 786, 42, 15, 6, 138, 64, 15, 343, 342, 2449, 144, 10, 2905, 102, 580, 544, 565, 236, 71, 50, 221, 132, 74, 873, 110, 136, 871, 454, 3271, 1398, 43, 163, 75, 119, 281, 149, 702, 10, 50, 102, 5, 588, 246, 532, 3578, 93, 367, 1397, 61, 440, 70, 147, 6, 32, 1694, 216, 99, 1934, 1245, 482, 15, 27, 3659, 6, 109, 59, 79, 3, 17]"
1061,9,"A lot of people had complaint that, even though Frozen is about the sisters, there's a lot of subplots that are more about things unrelated. But watching the movie I realize all of them are there to make the relationship stronger. Another complaint is that Elsa is not that much in the movie. But I came to the conclusion the movie is not strictly about the sistersThe movie is about Anna's physical and emotional journey to find the real meaning of true love. At the beginning of the movie we see a character similar to Giselle from Enchanted, desperate to find romance. But Anna is not that plain, Anna has a backstory. After feeling shut out her whole life by Elsa, she finally comes to the realization that the coronation of her sister is the chance to find the human contact she has been longing for her whole life. That's why she's willing to get married to Hans the day they just met. Because of Elsa. But Elsa has been shutting Anna out to protect her. THAT was the true love Anna couldn't see. Now, when Elsa leaves and Anna goes after her, she finds Kristoff. I'll talk about him later. They meet Olaf, the snowman. This poor guy has been one of the main complaints. Even I thought he was another ""annoying sidekick"". But the whole movie, specially the beginning, proved me wrong. He was not only funny (""-Give us a minute -Ok, one two) but he helped Anna remember Elsa and helps Anna realize that what she feels for Kristoff. The only thing that doesn't help in the plot is his song but the movie needs to show he's not a plain character and he has his own dreams too!Kristoff and Anna: he feels kind of jealous when he finds out she's engaged to someone she just met and throughout the journey they develop their relationship. And you may think I'm crazy, but I think that's about Anna and Elsa relationship too! Before Elsa leaves, she said Anna shouldn't marry a man she just met. And then she meets Kristoff. And they fall in love without knowing it. And they don't even get engaged in the movie! When Anna gets struck in the heart, they go with the ""love experts"" and they start singing so she falls in love with Kristoff. (Did they know an act of true love would save her? Did they know she had been struck? Did they know what they both were feeling for each other? I think they did). However, the song also helps Anna get to know that ""people make bad choice if they're mad or scared or stressed"". Like Elsa, afraid of hurting Anna, shut her out. That was love too. But when she needs true love, Kristoff believes in Anna and takes her to Hans. But we know they're all denying their true feelings. She's not sure what true love is. Then the Hans treason comes. Yeah, a little bit cliché the way he tells the plan. But you have to admit it's original in Disney that the dreamy prince let the princess die in the floor. Despicable. Almost like Scar killing his own brother. This proves Anna wrong. She may be thinking Elsa was right. But if that wasn't true love, then what is? Then Olaf comes to help and Anna and Kristoff try to get to each other to save the day. But Anna sees her sister about to die. She doesn't get to kiss Kristoff, she doesn't know saving Elsa would save her. She doesn't know that was true love too. All that she knows is she's missing her chance to be saved to save her sister. Then she finds out that true love is what she feels for her sister. Hans character is also great because is the mirror of what a person can be without the family's true love. Also, Anna hated ""the doors in her face"", but that was to protect her, that was love. Instead, Hans is like a""door in her back"", being himself a traitor. When I think I would have liked a lot more of Elsa, I realize this is Anna's movie. Not about the sisters, about Anna finding love in her sister. I would have loved more Elsa, at least a longer conversation between both sisters at the ending. However, this is a true Disney classic. Full of metaphors like any other classics. Full of lessons about love but, being original, about family love, with an excellent plot twist. I also liked the Grand Pabbie metaphor ""The heart is not so easily changed. But the head can be persuaded. The soundtrack is WONDERFUL. Not only the songs, but also the score, specially The Great Thaw (Vuelie Reprise), The Trolls, and all the flute that there's in it. The songs are great, Let It Go being the best. I would have liked For The First Time in Forever to be reprised at the end to have a last time with those great voices. But the instrumental reprise of Do You Wanna Build a Snowman is awesome. Fixer Upper has nice lyrics and and it's kind of a ""nobody's perfect"" song, so it's a little bit relatable. The visuals are also stunning. ""I never knew winter could be so beautiful"". There's no doubt Disney is back. It may be not as great as Beauty and the Beast, it may not have that great ball scene in the middle of the movie, it may not have the 'epicness' The Lion King has or the fantasy and romance The Little Mermaid has but missing that little something even the best Disney movies are missing, it has the moral about love, family, being ourselves, about being selfless that the best Disney classics have.","['lot', 'people', 'complaint', 'even', 'though', 'frozen', 'sister', 'lot', 'subplots', 'thing', 'unrelated', 'watch', 'movie', 'realize', 'make', 'relationship', 'strong', 'another',

1062,10,"Frozen is excellent. If you have kids or retain any childlike sense of wonder or humor, this belongs in your collection.The 'classic' part of my review title is what we've all seen before from Disney: a princess (in this case, two of them), a strong handsome guy as a love interest, an animal or anthromorph as comic relief, catchy songs, and the good guys win in the end. If you like virtually any other Disney animation movie, this will not disappoint on those scores. It hits all the right notes as we'd expect. As I said: classic Disney.Where Frozen excels, in my opinion, is where it strays from the classic Disney boilerplate. We see the two princesses as children, to start...very rare if not unique. We get an immediate sense of the sister's closeness, upon which the entire movie hinges. There would BE no movie without that bond.Elsa, a child, makes a 'mistake'...more like involved in an unforeseeable accident...which harms Anna. The parents race to save the situation, and get some 'help' which actually does more harm. This is a fairly mature theme rarely explored in ANY movie, much less a Disney animation. The trolls save Anna (of course), but give some spectacularly bad advice and the parents don't do a lot better with it. Elsa has special abilities which WILL get stronger; teaching her to fear and hate them is not a good path to put her on. Locking her away from the world...and the sister who loves her...is just plain stupid and an accident waiting to happen. Granted without that bad advice...again, no movie.Elsa, guilty over her powers hurting her beloved sister, being told the only way to stop from hurting anyone is to pretend they don't exist, kept locked away from the world like someone's dirty little secret, made to feel her suffering and loneliness is necessary...And the parents do the same to Anna. She's stuck in the locked castle, too, without a word of explanation. So on the first day she's let out, she gets a little crazy, 'falls' for the first 'suitable' guy she's ever met. Wants to marry him, asks Elsa (now the Queen) for her blessing. Elsa is smarter than Anna, says, ""No, you just met this guy!"" Anna pushes back, and eventually Elsa loses the control she's never really had a handle on.So Elsa leaves...again, trying to protect Anna and the kingdom. Anna seeks her out, Elsa tosses her out since as far as she knows, the only way to keep Anna safe is to keep her far away.The movie is about the love of two sisters for each other, and shows the stupid things people do to 'protect' those we love. While the 'romance' angle for Anna is a given, there's been a lot of complaints that Elsa doesn't have a love interest. For me, that's a huge selling point, as is the way Anna's is handled.There is NO way Elsa is ready for any sort of romantic love. She can't even handle sisterly love for the majority of the movie; all her life she's been told she has to keep it locked away, don't feel, stay apart. She's dangerous, will only hurt those she's close to. Yeah, there's lots of wiggle room for a spurious romantic interest there! Anna, as the sister that ISN'T saddled with terrifying powers or the guilt, can have a love interest. And as Kristoff mocks her, ""Wait, you got engaged to a guy you JUST MET TODAY?""; it's eventually shown that he and Anna actually grow closer through their mutual adventure, learning about family and friends and habits and so on.Frozen is ANNA's story. I'm hoping Frozen 2 would be Elsa's. She isn't ready for a love interest in the first installment, without it being some horrible cliché that would ruin one of the better characters Disney has come up with. Anna is fun, but there's a lot more to Elsa, and I sincerely hope she gets a chance to really shine in a future movie.Final accounting: classic Disney fun, with some deeper themes you can ignore or explore at your own leisure. Honestly, my favorite Disney movie since Aladdin.","['frozen', 'excellent', 'kid', 'retain', 'childlike', 'sense', 'wonder', 'humor', 'belongs', 'collection', 'classic', 'part', 'review', 'title',

1063,6,"I've recently watched Frozen (have no idea why I didn't watch it earlier). Movie isn't bad, I've found myself really touched at one moment. But I can't agree with some people saying it's the best. Disney had many better movies. Maybe it's because of Frozen's plot. Or I didn't understand it. First things first, I don't understand the whole ""conceal, don't feel"" thing. Elsa shouldn't have been isolated, she should have somehow learned to control her powers. Is it just me, or she was controlling her powers just fine before accident with Anna? Fear is her worst enemy, so why make things worse? Did her parents seriously believe that she will never have to talk with people? That she should be all by herself? The whole ""Let it go"" thing was predictable. Maybe the biggest problem of the movie is lack of a strong villain. Let's be honest,Elsa would make perfect evil queen, but it wasn't the case. Hans was evil, but his entire plan was summed up in, what, 20 minutes? It was a good start, but wasn't elaborated at all. Duke of Weselton was totally pointless.I still don't understand his role in this movie. Characters are not very well presented. For example Kristoff. When a character is introduced at the very beginning and shows up years later, you would expect that he would play a major role. That didn't happen. Kristoff was just a guide and at the end he didn't help that much. But he was following Anna, which was nice. Elsa was so-so, I think her parents made her be so scared. She honestly just wanted to live alone, without hurting anyone, especially Anna. Olaf was a comic-relief, along with Sven (they were funny). And villain thing again. One more thing bothered me. Too MANY songs. Like, everyone has a song. ""Do you wanna build a snowman?"", ""Let it go"" and ""For the first time in forever"" (especially the reprise at the ice castle) were very good. The rest of them were not. Sometimes it would seem, like they talk through songs, wait, they do, actually. Why was it good then? The movie taught us many things. Family is very important. Just look at Anna:she really wants to help Elsa, she is trying all the time to make things better. Between sister and herself, she chose to save her sister. Their bond is strong even though they were separated for so long. Frozen would be awesome if it had ""something more"", some epic fight maybe. Someone truly evil, maybe Hans, but his plan could have been much complicated. That would be the movie for every generation, not just for kids.

1064,10,"Ah. The fjords.Frozen is #8 on my top films of 2013 list.The animated short shown previous to the ice-harvest open, Get a Horse is a brilliant piece of animation. It's completely original, smart and thought provoking.The trailer; saw it way, way ahead of time when it was first released. Wasn't all that pumped for the movie because the short's devoid of narrative content. A moose and the snowman fight over the carrot nose on a frozen pond, and antics ensue. It wasn't boring, but not overwhelmingly great either. But I like it for the lack of spoiling.Why's director and writer Jennifer Lee's name got the '(XXX)' after it? Was that 'pre Vin Diesel,' or 'post Ice Cube?'Is she the thirtieth? Is that even possible? She can't be an ex porn-star, can she?Based on the story ""The Snow Queen"" by Hans Christian Andersen, Frozen's the newest addition to a list of Classic Disney Animated Features spanning back to the debut of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937.It's no secret I'm a huge fan of Disney animation, but you'll hear me groaning the loudest if I see a trailer for Planes 2 ever again.Planes is such a considerable downgrade in narrative and animation from Frozen.I was purposefully duped into spending six dollars on the rental. I understand their desire for the alternative source of income, but this misleading marketing campaign is deceitful.But we're talking about chilly Frozen, with icy Elsa and Anna, the coolest narrative since Tangled.And now we're sidetracking to the classics of recent years.2012 saw the release of two five-star Disney Animated Features: Brave (produced under the Pixar name) and Wreck-It Ralph. Two other movies deserving of a near perfect score were released in 2010: Toy Story 3 (which was darn close to five stars) and Tangled (which exceeds five stars.)2011 wasn't the best.But my point is Disney's on a hot streak. Hopefully they keep up the same quality for decades to come.Okay, I promise, the rest is about Frozen.It's fantastic. That's all you need for now.If you haven't seen it, do so. The less you know the better so beware the spoilers below.Do you know who's great?Kristen Bell.I just love that little starry eyed delight.Her breakout performance is hilariously understated in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, she plays a funny cameo in the old Starz comedy series Party Down starring Adam Scott, and the compelling role she played in the western HBO series Deadwood goes tragically unmentioned. I've been eying that Veronica Mars movie for days.I really enjoyed Anna, the character Kristen does the voice for. Let's hope K-Bell stays prolific.Idina Menzel does the voice of Elsa, and I must admit I'm more partial towards her character than her little sibling. This cold dame wears a gown made of ice. The fabric billows like it's malleable. I'm not positive one could weave ice fibers into a fabric, even with sorcery at immediate disposal.She must be a master on that ice-loom. I'm not trying to be snarky, the physics of Elsa's magic didn't concern me in the slightest during the movie. The ice gown exemplifies the beauty of animated films. A wonderful sort of idea is created that can't be captured in any other medium. If Frozen were live-action, we'd be much less inclined to buy the idea of a flexible sheet of solid ice.Now, on to nuance. One of the best tricks in the Disney feature handbook, is the inhuman sidekick. For Wall-E it's the cockroach, Rapunzel's is a chameleon named Pascal, Pinocchio's got Jiminy Cricket, and so on.My girl, Jen Lee the Thirtieth, who also wrote Wreck-It-Ralph, spins a similar sidekick song with Olaf the snowman. The alternative groove is he's a sentient snow golem summoned through Elsa's sorcery.Olaf's voiced by the promising young talent, Josh Gad. You know him as one of the original costars of The Book of Mormon. He's also the funniest part of NBC's 1600 Penn, an underrated comedy and solid show.I bet we'll see him popping up in all sorts of comedic antics from now on.I remember hearing on a podcast that J. Lee Turkey (that's a bowling reference, running out of Triple X jokes here) aims to invert classic Disney motifs. So, for example, the 'princess' element to the story is a small and almost insignificant point in Wreck-It-Reezy.With Frozen, Jennifer Strikeout takes these inversions several steps further, and it's an enormous benefit to the plot. The original conflict and its innovative resolution revolves around a pair of sisters, which isn't something we've seen before, and just a ton of fun along the way.Soon after the movie's open, there's a heart wrenching scene with Anna singing about building a snowman, as she grows older through the years without her sister.Fiddlesticks; that scene just rips me to pieces.That poor little girl just wants to play in the snow with her sisterSo my basic point is, there's some crying that occurs near the beginning of the film. I can't remember another Disney movie like that, except The Fox and the Hound perhaps. Hunchback of Notre Dame's another; I can't stand to see Quasimodo pelted with that rotten produce.And there's some crying towards the end of the film. It's a moving little cartoon, friends, and I think you'll love it as much as me.Quickest wrap-up ever –Completely original storytelling, moving conflicts, lovable characters, beautiful animation, educational, compelling, fun, melodic and heartwarming.Disney as per the usual.Good on ya Jenny Three Kiss.Keep up the good work!","['ah', 'fjord', 'frozen', 'top', 'film', 'list', 'animate', 'short',

1065,6,"I am a fan of Pixar animations and honestly, most of the best movies in the last 20 years are animations, many of them from Pixar. I think people who give 10 stars to this movie are not really aware of the legendary animation movies in the last 20 years. If you don't have a reference, you can call Frozen 10 stars. But for me Frozen did not reach to the top! If Frozen receives 10 stars, how are we going to rate Toy Story, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Wall-E, Cars, Brave, UP, all from Pixar? Between 20-30 stars!? Unfortunately ""Frozen"" lacks of an interesting, unique, exciting story. I took my 13 years old daughter to this movie because I saw the teaser of ""Olaf"" and thought that this was going to be a good one. SPOILER!!! Similar to other countless Disney's products, we hear ""true love's kiss""! Really!SPOILER!!!! In order to make it even worse, it comes in a musical format! Torture in high volume with infamous singers doing 1950s! Predictable, predictable, predictable! You know what is going to happen and how this movie will end! SPOILER!!!!!! Olaf is a great creation but does not appear in the movie until 45th minute. I was trying to decide whether we leave or stay since movie was extremely boring until then. Finally Olaf came and movie changed. First half of the Frozen gets 4 stars from me and second half gets 8 stars. That explains why it received a total of 6 stars from me:))The only thing makes this movie enjoyable is OLAF and it is not in the movie until second half!!! Come on!I believe Disney is an obstacle in front of Pixar. ""Prince, princess stories"", ""true love's kiss"", ""naughty little girls who can do better than boys"" are Disney's tradition/trade mark and subcontracting it to Pixar does not really work. Pixar would do better getting rid of the templates put in front of them by Disney.I do recommend renting DVD as you can skip the first 45mins.","['fan', 'pixar', 'animation', 'honestly', 'best', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'animation', 'many', 'pixar', 'think', 'people', 'give', 'star', 'movie', 'really', 'aware', 'legendary', 'animation', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'reference', 'call', 'frozen', 'star', 'frozen', 'reach', 'top', 'frozen', 'receives', 'star', 'go', 'rate', 'toy', 'story', 'monster', 'inc', 'incredibles', 'ratatouille', 'wall', 'e', 'car', 'brave', 'pixar', 'star', 'unfortunately', 'frozen', 'lack', 'interest', 'unique', 'excite', 'story', 'take', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'movie', 'saw', 'teaser', 'olaf', 'thought', 'go', 'good', 'one', 'spoiler', 'similar', 'countless', 'disney', 'product', 'hear', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'really', 'spoiler', 'order', 'make', 'even', 'bad', 'come', 'musical', 'format', 'torture', 'high', 'volume', 'infamous', 'singer', 'predictable', 'predictable', 'predictable', 'know', 'go', 'happen', 'movie', 'end', 'spoiler', 'olaf', 'great', 'creation', 'appear', 'movie', 'th', 'minute', 'try', 'decide', 'whether', 'leave', 'stay', 'since', 'movie', 'extremely', 'boring', 'finally', 'olaf', 'come', 'movie', 'change', 'first', 'half', 'frozen', 'get', 'star', 'second', 'half', 'get', 'star', 'explains', 'receive', 'total', 'star', 'thing', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'olaf', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'come', 'believe', 'disney', 'obstacle', 'front', 'pixar', 'prince', 'princess', 'story', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'naughty', 'little', 'girl', 'well', 'boy', 'disney', 'tradition', 'trade', 'mark', 'subcontract', 'pixar', 'really', 'work', 'pixar', 'would', 'well', 'get', 'rid', 'template', 'put', 'front', 'disney', 'recommend', 'rent', 'dvd', 'skip', 'first', 'min']","[176, 194, 21, 542, 34, 1, 197, 47, 21, 61, 194, 37, 46, 57, 249, 1, 22, 1627, 2426, 21, 1, 197, 47, 1246, 308, 5, 249, 5, 1046, 239, 5, 2997, 249, 13, 694, 463, 12, 495, 1926, 2214, 5170, 1201, 893, 1406, 335, 194, 249, 573, 5, 273, 122, 414, 447, 12, 55, 47, 64, 389, 1, 157, 1773, 32, 92, 13, 17, 10, 419, 446, 1820, 2, 1060, 568, 62, 6, 372, 22, 419, 496, 14, 28, 65, 40, 51, 1778, 1614, 206, 3918, 2412, 706, 331, 331, 331, 56, 13, 290, 1, 41, 419, 32, 25, 1075, 582, 1, 1210, 211, 87, 491, 638, 322, 510, 98, 1, 423, 370, 241, 32, 40, 1, 209, 36, 346, 5, 19, 249, 319, 346, 19, 249, 1497, 852, 1479, 249, 43, 14, 1, 306, 32, 1, 319, 346, 40, 220, 2, 2094, 938, 194, 82, 29, 12, 62, 6, 372, 48, 76, 18, 408, 2, 1071, 3939, 820, 194, 22, 107, 194, 26, 18, 19, 3953, 2729, 196, 938, 2, 262, 1605, 540, 1857, 36, 1624]"

As far as I recall the last one I saw was The Little Mermaid in which I recall a couple of half decent numbers, Under The Sea being one. When Frozen was released this week in the UK it garnered money reviews from about half the critics, some of which praised the score, so I thought what the hey. It didn't exactly live up to those reviews, at least not in my book, and the score certainly contained nothing to equal Under The Sea but nevertheless it was well done and on the whole entertaining. The Elsa character just about justified the title of Snow Queen but Hans Anderson would have been hard put to recognise any of it as his original story.

The story of Elsa and Anna is quite sad when you think about it, But they fixed their issues in the end which most siblings cannot do. Disney has really out done themselves with this icy, fun, adventurous movie and I think this will be entertaining children for years.

1068,10,"Thanks Disney! I owe you more than one. You gave me 90 minutes of joy, love, happiness. I loved Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, Sven and fantastic Olaf! Oh man this snowman is like a miracle! I can compare it with ""Cate Blanchett"" in the ""Blue Jasmine""! She was amazing and she had to won the Academy Award and I give this snowman my own Academy Award! He's the most hilarious guy so far, even funnier than ""Art"" in ""Monsters University"" (Do you remember how lovely ""Art"" was?). Tell you what ... I think this is the first animation which shows the love between 2 sisters. The love which can melt the toughest ice. I was wondering that it didn't end up with having ""Anna"" and ""Kristoff"" kissing each other to cure her. The very last scenes was pure shocking. As I can remember such scene in the ""Brave"" but that was about the love between mother and her daughter and this one is far apart. Elsa was beautiful and charming, I love her character. And Sven, the funny deer, had also an important role in the story. This is Art. It's not just an animated movie!

1069,10,"I have chosen to do a review on a song called Do you want to build a snowman. The song is out of the film called Disney Frozen. I have picked this song because it is happy and sad at the same time.The song is about two sister one with a curse and hides in her room away she is called Elsa. The other sister is called Anna she is the one who is sing the song called Do you want to build a snowman. Anna is sing the song trying to get Elsa out of her room and play with her but Elsa stays in her room away from Anna. I like this song because it is happy and sad at the same time. When Anna is singing the song to her sister you can feel what she is singing. In the song something happens to Elsa and Anna's mam and dad. When this happens the music changes and you can tell that something has happened. At the end of the song Anna is singing a different way than the when she was singing in the begging. Anna is singing different at the end of the song because she is sad about what has happened to her mom and dad. Anna is sing to Elsa because Anna is upset and wants her sister to come out of her room.The artists who sing the song called Do you want to build a snowman they are Kristen Bell, Agatha Lee Monn and Katie Lopez.","['chosen', 'review', 'song', 'call', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'song', 'film', 'call', 'disney', 'frozen', 'picked', 'song', 'happy', 'sad', 'time', 'song', 'two', 'sister', 'one', 'curse', 'hide', 'room', 'away', 'call', 'elsa', 'sister', 'call', 'anna', 'one', 'sing', 'song', 'call', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'anna', 'sing', 'song', 'try', 'get', 'elsa', 'room', 'play', 'elsa', 'stay', 'room', 'away', 'anna', 'like', 'song', 'happy', 'sad', 'time', 'anna', 'sing', 'song', 'sister', 'feel', 'sing', 'song', 'something', 'happens', 'elsa', 'anna', 'mam', 'dad', 'happens', 'music', 'change', 'tell', 'something', 'happen', 'end', 'song', 'anna', 'sing', 'different', 'way', 'sing', 'beg', 'anna', 'sing', 'different', 'end', 'song', 'sad', 'happen', 'mom', 'dad', 'anna', 'sing', 'elsa', 'anna', 'upset', 'want', 'sister', 'come', 'room', 'artist', 'sing', 'song', 'call', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'kristen', 'bell', 'agatha', 'lee', 'monn', 'katie', 'lopez']","[1841, 161, 11, 308, 59, 202, 45, 11, 3, 308, 2, 5, 2393, 11, 301, 579, 20, 11, 42, 15, 10, 405, 676, 506, 101, 308, 4, 15, 308, 7, 10, 63, 11, 308, 59, 202, 45, 7, 63, 11, 87, 19, 4, 506, 204, 4, 510, 506, 101, 7, 9, 11, 301, 579, 20, 7, 63, 11, 15, 53, 63, 11, 89, 591, 4, 7, 1703, 591, 58, 209, 143, 89, 290, 41, 11, 7, 63, 140, 50, 63, 2211, 7, 63, 140, 41, 11, 579, 290, 1109, 1703, 7, 63, 4, 7, 1320, 59, 15, 40, 506, 1886, 63, 11, 308, 59, 202, 45, 162, 146, 416, 928]"
1070,10,"I can hardly think of any ways to make this movie better, and the only things I can think of are so minor that they can easily be ignored. The movie might have made Elsa care more about solitude, and wish she could be with her sister and help her through her loneliness. The movie portrays Elsa as being unaffected by her solitary life, and does not display any pain in her seclusion except in the last part of ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"". However, if they had shown her pain then the plot would have been changed, since love and an open, caring heart are what enable her to control her powers and melt the winter storm. Also, though this is the fault of the animation more than anything else, the movie makes Elsa and Anna much more attractive than any of the regular townspeople, who are overweight and old in comparison. I absolutely love the affection between the sisters, and would not change a thing about it because it is so meaningful and pure. The plot twist that changes Disney's signature 'love at first sight' to sacrificial love could not have been portrayed better. The sound track is the best of any Disney movie yet, and all of the songs are fun and important. People say that Elsa should have had a love story, but this is ridiculous. It would have centered the movie around romance instead of love in sacrifice.

Frozen certainly did. I am not sure what I enjoyed more:* The actual movie* Seeing so many families out together on a Saturday afternoon* The squeals of little ones throughout the movie - those deep belly laughs we all love* Running into my BFF who was their with her family * Looking over at our 3 year old in the lap of his Papa Jay smiling as they eat an entire large popcornI will admit I don't get to many animated films these days. (In the past year I have seen two - The Croods and Frozen). One thing seems pretty consistent though: Girl gets into trouble, Girl meets boy, Girl is rescued, Girl falls in love, Girl lives happily ever after with said boy. SPOILER ALERT: This movie is different! These girls don't need any boys!! As a matter of fact, they learn a couple of lessons the hard way about who you can and can not trust - and at the end of the day, it's family that wins. I sure wish real life always turned out that way. Sigh.Anyway, not much more to say - the little ones in the theater loved it, and so did the rest of us ""big kids"".

1072,10,"When I saw the first trailers, I didn't know what to think of the movie. It showed a snowman who seemed pretty annoying. But again, it was Disney, so I went to go eventually watch it anyways. When I came out of the theater, I was stunned. This was by far, the best Disney movie since the ones in the Disney Renaissance. The Good:-Great Writing and Characters: The writing to the story is funny, touching, sad, and heartfelt. The characters were also really likable, funny, and interesting. After all, these were the people who wrote Tangled, which is also a really good Disney movie.-Superb Acting: The acting was great. Nothiing else to say about this, than good performances across the board.-Visually Stunning: The visuals are amazing. The ice effects look awesome, the sets were good (though it sometimes seemed like we walked onto the set of Brave). My only complaint is that the people did look kind of like dolls, but it's more of a nitpick than an actual problem.-Songs are Memorable(and not by Randy Newman)- These songs are really really really catchy, but in a good way in the sense that they are unbelievably good. They are memorable, greatly sung, beautiful, and sometimes funny. Plus, they aren't by Randy Newman. The Mixed (There isn't really anything bad here) - -The Snowman Character: This character was on the verge of being annoying, though always managed to tell something funny. Even if what he told was funny, he always bothered me. I really don't know how to feel about this character, but I could stand him. He's no Jar Jar Binks, but he does come close sometimes.-A bit too many songs at the end: This is more of a nitpick, but the beginning almost seems like Les Mis (not that I have anything against Les Mis) in which that almost everything is sung. The songs are a bit more spaced out in the second act, but they crammed too much in the first act. -Bad Twist in the Third Act: The third act has two twists. One bad, and one really good twist. The first twist isn't good. There is nothing that supports the twist and makes no sense as it just seems rushed. The third act is saved by the other twist which I legitimately did not expect. I'm not going to give away the twist because this is a great ending you don't expect.Overall Thoughts: This is a visually appealing experience with memorable characters, great story telling, and catchy songs you'll be singing out loud for months on end. Even with a few flaws, this rivals the movies in the Disney Renaissance. I give it 10 out of 10 stars.-A 15 year old boy who wanted to see the Hobbit.","['saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'know', 'think', 'movie', 'show', 'snowman', 'seem', 'pretty', 'annoy', 'disney', 'go', 'go', 'eventually', 'watch', 'anyways', 'come', 'theater', 'stun', 'far', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'since', 'one', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'good', 'great', 'write', 'character', 'write', 'story', 'funny', 'touch', 'sad', 'heartfelt', 'character', 'also', 'really', 'likable', 'funny', 'interest', 'people', 'write', 'tangle', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'disney', 'movie', 'superb', 'act', 'act', 'great', 'nothiing', 'else', 'say', 'good', 'performance', 'across', 'board', 'visually', 'stun', 'visuals', 'amaze', 'ice', 'effect', 'look', 'awesome', 'set', 'good', 'though', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'like', 'walk', 'onto', 'set', 'brave', 'complaint', 'people', 'look', 'kind', 'like', 'doll', 'nitpick', 'actual', 'problem', 'song', 'memorable', 'randy', 'newman', 'song', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'catchy', 'good', 'way', 'sense', 'unbelievably', 'good', 'memorable', 'greatly', 'sung', 'beautiful', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'plus', 'randy', 'newman', 'mixed', 'really', 'anything', 'bad', 'snowman', 'character', 'character', 'verge', 'annoy', 'though', 'always', 'manage', 'tell', 'something', 'funny', 'even', 'told', 'funny', 'always', 'bother', 'really', 'know', 'feel', 'character', 'could', 'stand', 'jar', 'jar', 'binks', 'come', 'close', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'many', 'song', 'end', 'nitpick', 'begin', 'almost', 'seem', 'like', 'le', 'mi', 'anything', 'le', 'mi', 'almost', 'everything', 'sung', 'song', 'bit', 'space', 'second', 'act', 'crammed', 'much', 'first', 'act', 'bad', 'twist', 'third', 'act', 'third', 'act', 'two', 'twist', 'one', 'bad', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'twist', 'first', 'twist', 'good', 'nothing', 'support', 'twist', 'make', 'sense', 'seem', 'rush', 'third', 'act', 'save', 'twist', 'legitimately', 'expect', 'go', 'give', 'away', 'twist', 'great', 'end', 'expect', 'overall', 'thought', 'visually', 'appeal', 'experience', 'memorable', 'character', 'great', 'story', 'tell', 'catchy', 'song', 'sing', 'loud', 'month', 'end', 'even', 'flaw', 'rival', 'movie', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'give', 'star', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'want', 'see', 'hobbit']","[157, 36, 394, 56, 37, 1, 78, 45, 75, 136, 238, 2, 13, 13, 652, 23, 1292, 40, 312, 315, 142, 34, 2, 1, 98, 10, 2, 465, 17, 25, 165, 8, 165, 12, 85, 260, 579, 1402, 8, 27, 22, 402, 85, 122, 46, 165, 83, 27, 22, 17, 2, 1, 904, 112, 112, 25, 270, 35, 17, 493, 1168, 2698, 585, 315, 267, 96, 33, 278, 66, 338, 144, 17, 100, 504, 75, 9, 669, 1922, 144, 335, 897, 46, 66, 193, 9, 1287, 2320, 815, 198, 11, 268, 3995, 3996, 11, 22, 22, 22, 266, 17, 50, 217, 3935, 17, 268, 1316, 684, 93, 504, 85, 569, 3995, 3996, 1082, 22, 212, 65, 45, 8, 8, 238, 100, 163, 857, 143, 89, 85, 28, 511, 85, 163, 864, 22, 56, 53, 8, 54, 361, 1007, 1007, 1887, 40, 351, 504, 95, 61, 11, 41, 2320, 160, 173, 75, 9, 2066, 2079, 212, 2066, 2079, 173, 132, 684, 11, 95, 1628, 319, 112, 5084, 31, 36, 112, 65, 129, 715, 112, 715, 112, 42, 129, 10, 65, 10, 22, 17, 129, 36, 129, 17, 156, 740, 129, 14, 217, 75, 525, 715, 112, 111, 129, 2840, 131, 13, 57, 101, 129, 25, 41, 131, 166, 92, 585, 484, 334, 268, 8, 25, 12, 143, 266, 11, 63, 798, 860, 41, 28, 386, 1487, 1, 2, 465, 57, 249, 47, 64, 408, 59, 16, 3964]"
1073,10,"Technically, substantially and thematically amazing. What I liked best was that it was really a complete overhaul of the Disney Princess genre. With strong feminist underpinnings, celebration of both individual free will and communal cohesiveness, a more realistic and balanced perspective on love and romance, and a hilarious snow man, Frozen sets itself apart and can easily be seen as one of the all time best Disney movies.Although the spontaneous, unrestrained and effervescent Ana is not too different from the traditional Disney princess (she's a bit more naive and dorky though), the repressed, fearful and tormented Elsa is a new type of Disney princess. Elsa's display of power are probably a first in movie history, as she is one of the few Disney characters and possibly the only female character whose destructive power is not depicted as purely wicked, but as natural unwieldy talent. Her fear-fueled aggression and retaliation is also empathized with throughout, and although she takes the slot of the villain, she is never signed off as one.The ending has the best twist of all Disney movies. The saving act, the act of true love, is not a romantic act at all. In fact, romance and infatuation are rather discredited by the film itself. No, this movie shatters the long passed notion in movies, ranging from Snow White to The Matrix, of an act of romantic love literally saving a person's soul. Here, the act of true love is not the dependent and precarious reception of a romantic gesture, but the active and brave performance of an altruistic deed. And that just really sets this already amazingly well animated, well characterized, and well written film as one of the best animated movies of all time and the best Disney princess movie of all time.","['technically', 'substantially', 'thematically', 'amaze', 'like', 'best', 'really', 'complete', 'overhaul', 'disney', 'princess', 'genre', 'strong', 'feminist', 'underpinnings', 'celebration', 'individual', 'free', 'communal', 'cohesiveness', 'realistic', 'balance', 'perspective', 'love', 'romance', 'hilarious', 'snow', 'man', 'frozen', 'set', 'apart', 'easily', 'see', 'one', 'time', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'although', 'spontaneous', 'unrestrained', 'effervescent', 'ana', 'different', 'traditional', 'disney', 'princess', 'bit', 'naive', 'dorky', 'though', 'repress', 'fearful', 'torment', 'elsa', 'new', 'type', 'disney', 'princess', 'elsa', 'display', 'power', 'probably', 'first', 'movie', 'history', 'one', 'disney', 'character', 'possibly', 'female', 'character', 'whose', 'destructive', 'power', 'depict', 'purely', 'wicked', 'natural', 'unwieldy', 'talent', 'fear', 'fuel', 'aggression', 'retaliation', 'also', 'empathize', 'throughout', 'although', 'take', 'slot', 'villain', 'never', 'sign', 'one', 'end', 'best', 'twist', 'disney', 'movie', 'save', 'act', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'romantic', 'act', 'fact', 'romance', 'infatuation', 'rather', 'discredit', 'film', 'movie', 'shatters', 'long', 'pass', 'notion', 'movie', 'range', 'snow', 'white', 'matrix', 'act', 'romantic', 'love', 'literally', 'save', 'person', 'soul', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'dependent', 'precarious', 'reception', 'romantic', 'gesture', 'active', 'brave', 'performance', 'altruistic', 'deed', 'really', 'set', 'already', 'amazingly', 'well', 'animate', 'well', 'characterize', 'well', 'write', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'animate', 'movie', 'time', 'best', 'disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'time']","[1790, 5212, 96, 9, 34, 22, 656, 2, 29, 768, 167, 720, 3269, 1921, 593, 640, 677, 1141, 6, 363, 364, 39, 145, 5, 144, 512, 403, 16, 10, 20, 34, 2, 1, 255, 2923, 3709, 929, 140, 462, 2, 29, 95, 1144, 4720, 100, 3213, 1604, 3188, 4, 108, 524, 2, 29, 4, 1151, 24, 210, 36, 1, 636, 10, 2, 8, 842, 237, 8, 620, 3984, 24, 1753, 2115, 678, 1660, 800, 187, 3776, 27, 4981, 296, 255, 55, 3993, 104, 88, 1676, 10, 41, 34, 129, 2, 1, 111, 112, 112, 62, 6, 393, 112, 201, 363, 3059, 191, 4584, 3, 1, 4412, 169, 1122, 2060, 1, 958, 39, 365, 112, 393, 6, 643, 111, 441, 1074, 112, 62, 6, 2776, 3944, 393, 2661, 3205, 335, 493, 3614, 22, 144, 397, 1824, 18, 38, 18, 5235, 18, 165, 3, 10, 34, 38, 1, 20, 34, 2, 29, 1, 20]"
1074,10,"Disney's magic is back after 20 years, this film is by far (without counting the Pixar ones) the greatest one they have released, I never had so many different emotions while watching a film, it will make you laugh and cry multiple times.Mild Spoilers! - The main plot centers about Elsa, a princess going to be queen who has the power to control and create ice and snow but after an accident in which almost kills her young sister, Anna, she has to stop making magic and no one can ever see her doing that stuff. Everything goes bad for Elsa, as she has stronger powers everyday but her parents forgive her to use them and try everything to control them until all gets even worse when the king and queen die from an accident, she becomes alone with no one knowing her secret until the coronation day where she gets angry about her sister and uses her powers accidentally. She goes far away from the city unknowing she started a never ending winter. Her sister, Anna, will go to find her and try to convince her to use the powers to stop it and everything become normal again but that won't be easy.The story is very interesting as it has many different kind of scenes from action to comedy passing to drama and musical. Yes, there are lot of songs and good ones specially ""For the first time since forever"" and the great ""Let it go"" which will win for sure an Academy Award next year. If you loved the old Disney films like Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King and Little Mermaid, you are going to love this one too. While this movie is based on ""The Snow Queen"" (I actually preferred that title over Frozen) it doesn't share anything from the old tale except the main character, Elsa, but nothing else. The animation is very well done, the best one even from Pixar films, I really hope it wins a couple of Oscars as it deserves it!The characters are very different from each other, we have the funny one, Olaf the little snowman making funny jokes all the time, Kristoff and his reindeer are the heroes who help Anna to find her sister and Anna herself who remember a bit to Rapunzel from ""Tangled"", she's a funny and foolish character that all children will like. And then there's Elsa who's the best from all of them, it's a dimensional character with feelings that you will feel sorry for her and feel her pain...I actually felt connected with her (for personal reasons that I'm not including here, he-he) but she's the main reason why I loved this film!· The good things of this film is the main character Elsa (I felt in love with her in an instant) and the entire casting, the songs are well made for the first time since a long, long time. I was actually afraid they'd include too much comedy (like they did in Tangled) but it was good they didn't. The story is entertaining and the ending is sad but beautiful!· The bad things are the other main character, Anna, who has too much screen time, don't get me wrong, she was good but I'd liked to see more of Elsa who is, in all means, a more interesting character. Another thing I didn't like was those small creatures that looked like rocks and ogres, they weren't funny neither important for the movie.RATING: 9.4","['disney', 'magic', 'back', 'year', 'film', 'far', 'without', 'counting', 'pixar', 'one', 'great', 'one', 'release', 'never', 'many', 'different', 'emotion', 'watch', 'film', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'multiple', 'time', 'mild', 'spoiler', 'main', 'plot', 'center', 'elsa', 'princess', 'go', 'queen', 'power', 'control', 'create', 'ice', 'snow', 'accident', 'almost', 'kill', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'stop', 'make', 'magic', 'one', 'ever', 'see', 'stuff', 'everything', 'go', 'bad', 'elsa', 'strong', 'power', 'everyday', 'parent', 'forgive', 'use', 'try', 'everything', 'control', 'get', 'even', 'bad', 'king', 'queen', 'die', 'accident', 'becomes', 'alone', 'one', 'know', 'secret', 'coronation', 'day', 'get', 'angry', 'sister', 'us', 'power', 'accidentally', 'go', 'far', 'away', 'city', 'unknowing', 'start', 'never', 'end', 'winter', 'sister', 'anna', 'go', 'find', 'try', 'convince', 'use', 'power', 'stop', 'everything', 'become', 'normal', 'easy', 'story', 'interest', 'many', 'different', 'kind', 'scene', 'action', 'comedy', 'passing', 'drama', 'musical', 'yes', 'lot', 'song', 'good', 'one', 'specially', 'first', 'time', 'since', 'forever', 'great', 'let', 'go', 'win', 'sure', 'academy', 'award', 'next', 'year', 'love', 'old', 'disney', 'film', 'like', 'beauty', 'beast', 'lion', 'king', 'little', 'mermaid', 'go', 'love', 'one', 'movie', 'base', 'snow', 'queen', 'actually', 'prefer', 'title', 'frozen', 'share', 'anything', 'old', 'tale', 'except', 'main', 'character', 'elsa', 'nothing', 'else', 'animation', 'well', 'best', 'one', 'even', 'pixar', 'film', 'really', 'hope', 'win', 'couple', 'oscar', 'deserves', 'character', 'different', 'funny', 'one', 'olaf', 'little', 'snowman', 'make', 'funny', 'joke', 'time', 'kristoff', 'reindeer', 'hero', 'help', 'anna', 'find', 'sister', 'anna', 'remember', 'bit', 'rapunzel', 'tangle', 'funny', 'foolish', 'character', 'child', 'like', 'elsa', 'best', 'dimensional', 'character', 'feeling', 'feel', 'sorry', 'feel', 'pain', 'actually', 'felt', 'connect', 'personal', 'reason', 'include', 'main', 'reason', 'love', 'film', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'elsa', 'felt', 'love', 'instant', 'entire', 'cast', 'song', 'well', 'make', 'first', 'time', 'since', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'actually', 'afraid', 'include', 'much', 'comedy', 'like', 'tangle', 'good', 'story', 'entertain', 'end', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'bad', 'thing', 'main', 'character', 'anna', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'like', 'see', 'elsa', 'mean', 'interest', 'character', 'another', 'thing', 'like', 'small', 'creature', 'look', 'like', 'rock', 'ogre', 'funny', 'neither', 'important', 'movie', 'rating']","[2, 150, 74, 47, 3, 142, 137, 2640, 194, 10, 25, 10, 288, 88, 61, 140, 240, 23, 3, 14, 190, 505, 1418, 20, 2497, 419, 119, 52, 649, 4, 29, 13, 49, 24, 128, 134, 33, 39, 480, 173, 286, 73, 15, 7, 284, 14, 150, 10, 81, 16, 698, 132, 13, 65, 4, 167, 24, 2021, 118, 1584, 158, 87, 132, 128, 19, 28, 65, 97, 49, 368, 480, 380, 344, 10, 56, 508, 343, 138, 19, 2162, 15, 919, 24, 300, 13, 142, 101, 1389, 120, 88, 41, 105, 15, 7, 13, 71, 87, 1444, 158, 24, 284, 132, 179, 873, 454, 12, 122, 61, 140, 193, 90, 345, 279, 2792, 745, 51, 325, 84, 11, 17, 10, 3336, 36, 20, 98, 287, 25, 30, 13, 374, 207, 856, 469, 418, 47, 6, 64, 2, 3, 9, 149, 203, 152, 97, 48, 422, 13, 6, 10, 1, 256, 39, 49, 103, 957, 590, 5, 781, 212, 64, 114, 474, 119, 8, 4, 156, 270, 21, 18, 34, 10, 28, 194, 3, 22, 384, 374, 398, 302, 592, 8, 140, 85, 10, 32, 48, 45, 14, 85, 451, 20, 67, 151, 544, 135, 7, 71, 15, 7, 391, 95, 527, 83, 85, 2901, 8, 70, 9, 4, 34, 751, 8, 680, 53, 777, 53, 1765, 103, 155, 1397, 537, 180, 349, 119, 180, 6, 3, 17, 43, 3, 119, 8, 4, 155, 6, 982, 264, 227, 11, 18, 14, 36, 20, 98, 169, 169, 20, 103, 558, 349, 31, 279, 9, 83, 17, 12, 243, 41, 579, 93, 65, 43, 119, 8, 7, 31, 369, 20, 19, 280, 17, 9, 16, 4, 218, 122, 8, 102, 43, 9, 601, 1334, 66, 9, 834, 85, 1197, 289, 1, 437]"
1075,2,"Disney, when are you ever going to join the 21st century? Its animation studio just stays living in the past. The new Disney film Frozen could have easily been made in the 1940's. It is based on a classic fairy tale known as The Snow Queen. But you would think that in 2013 they might try to make it appeal to people today. Well you'd be wrong.If you've seen the trailer for this movie, they market it as a movie more in the vein of Ice Age. There's a funny-looking snowman walking on ice and struggling to stay on his feet; he later winds up sneezing so hard that he blows his head off. All you see is the snowman and a likable moose. Instead, Frozen is actually a ridiculously old-fashioned movie about princesses. This movie is more like The Sound of Music than anything from this century. The songs all sound old and dated, just like everything else in the movie. The only good thing in the movie is that snowman, and they don't even bring him in until halfway through the film.I understand that this is a movie aimed at kids, but most knowledgeable film studios nowadays at least try to entertain the adults watching as well. I was bored out of my mind. Then after briefly falling asleep, I woke up to see a prince trying to decapitate the princess with a sword. Sure, that's what little kids want to see. Sorry if I ruined that for you but hopefully it will keep you away from the film then. Of course there will be children who enjoy the film simply because it's an animated fairy tale, and little kids don't expect much anyway. But something tells me that people in their 80's will enjoy this old-fashioned crap just as much. It opens on November 27 but try to enjoy your Thanksgiving by not seeing it.","['disney', 'ever', 'go', 'join', 'st', 'century', 'animation', 'studio', 'stay', 'living', 'past', 'new', 'disney', 'film', 'frozen', 'could', 'easily', 'make', 'base', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'know', 'snow', 'queen', 'would', 'think', 'might', 'try', 'make', 'appeal', 'people', 'today', 'well', 'wrong', 'see', 'trailer', 'movie', 'market', 'movie', 'vein', 'ice', 'age', 'funny', 'look', 'snowman', 'walk', 'ice', 'struggle', 'stay', 'foot', 'later', 'wind', 'sneeze', 'hard', 'blow', 'head', 'see', 'snowman', 'likable', 'moose', 'instead', 'frozen', 'actually', 'ridiculously', 'old', 'fashion', 'movie', 'princess', 'movie', 'like', 'sound', 'music', 'anything', 'century', 'song', 'sound', 'old', 'date', 'like', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'snowman', 'even', 'bring', 'halfway', 'film', 'understand', 'movie', 'aim', 'kid', 'knowledgeable', 'film', 'studio', 'nowadays', 'least', 'try', 'entertain', 'adult', 'watch', 'well', 'bore', 'mind', 'briefly', 'fall', 'asleep', 'woke', 'see', 'prince', 'try', 'decapitate', 'princess', 'sword', 'sure', 'little', 'kid', 'want', 'see', 'sorry', 'ruin', 'hopefully', 'keep', 'away', 'film', 'course', 'child', 'enjoy', 'film', 'simply', 'animate', 'fairy', 'tale', 'little', 'kid', 'expect', 'much', 'anyway', 'something', 'tell', 'people', 'enjoy', 'old', 'fashion', 'crap', 'much', 'open', 'november', 'try', 'enjoy', 'thanksgiving', 'see']","[2, 81, 13, 813, 1405, 1248, 21, 311, 510, 704, 276, 108, 2, 3, 5, 54, 403, 14, 256, 69, 219, 114, 56, 39, 49, 26, 37, 252, 87, 14, 484, 46, 674, 18, 280, 16, 394, 1, 1447, 1, 4326, 33, 139, 85, 66, 45, 669, 33, 639, 510, 1892, 358, 848, 5236, 307, 1255, 317, 16, 45, 402, 1503, 208, 5, 103, 2422, 64, 974, 1, 29, 1, 9, 259, 58, 212, 1248, 11, 259, 64, 927, 9, 132, 270, 1, 17, 43, 1, 45, 28, 221, 1612, 3, 216, 1, 859, 60, 4550, 3, 311, 1475, 250, 87, 243, 147, 23, 18, 604, 320, 2355, 186, 3836, 3869, 16, 82, 87, 29, 1277, 207, 48, 60, 59, 16, 777, 851, 1309, 154, 101, 3, 228, 70, 91, 3, 341, 38, 219, 114, 48, 60, 131, 31, 497, 89, 143, 46, 91, 64, 974, 1114, 31, 318, 1581, 87, 91, 2678, 16]"
1076,7,"Frozen has basically everything to be a fun family movie. It has cute characters and great humor for the kids, while still keeping the adults awake with beautiful visuals and excellent music. I watched it with my niece and I was pleasantly surprised and entertained throughout.Frozen tells us the story about two sisters: Anna and Elsa of Arendelle. Elsa has always harbored secret ice powers which she has to keep a secret after hurting Anna by accident. Elsa accidentally exposed her powers at her coronation ceremony and freezes over Arendelle. She is forced to retreat into isolation and we follow Anna as she goes to look for her and try to convince her to revert it back. Along the way we get introduced to other characters such as Hans (Anna's suitor), Kristoff (an ice farmer? who helps Anna) and Olaf (a cute talking snowman).Let me start by talking about the story. Most of Frozen's main characters are fleshed out and three-dimensional. It takes time to run us through backstory without being tedious to watch. I agree that there are some weaker/underdeveloped characters and I will get to that later. But overall the characters are fun and easy to follow along with and the kids will like them a lot. Despite some unanswered questions (which I will get to later), the story is original and fun to sit through. There is solid humor and the pacing is great. You will be entertained throughout.Frozen's visuals are lush, beautiful and very intricate, especially on clothing and ice. Its painting of Arendelle and the incorporation of Scandinavian elements are one of the best parts of the movie. The characters and landscapes are very three-dimensional and lifelike. It is truly a technical achievement and a wonderful experience to sit through.And of course, the soundtrack is stellar as well. We've all memorized ""let it go"" by hearing kids sing it 24/7, and there is a good reason for that. The score is so catchy and fun to sing; with songs like ""For the first time in forever"" and ""Do you want to build a snowman?"". The songs are some of Disney's best. The kids will love it and adults will secretly as well lol. Also, the voice acting is amazing. Never do you think that you're hearing actors, but the characters themselves. The cast is very talented and provides very solid musical numbers as well.Despite these achievements, Frozen has tried to make us ignore some very prominent weak points. First of all, there is too many loose ends untied. What about those magical trolls? Marshmallow? Olaf? There is little to no explanation for these characters. It almost seems like they are created as a segway to keep the story rolling along. As well, with the exception of Elsa, Anna and Kristoff, the characters lack depth and development (Duke of Weaselton, Hans, Olaf, etc). Furthermore, there is plot holes so gaping to the point the story stops making sense if you think about it. What's the point of the fixer upper song? Who ran the castle for all this time? Does Elsa's powers include making life? It's like Disney chose to gloss over these holes with filler because they have no idea how to answer them. The ending left us a little confused as well. I was expecting all the loose ends patched up, however they were left like that with no explanation. At the end there was a feeling of incompletion in the air. Throughout the whole film some parts seemed kind of lazy and illogical. Instead of easily providing some explanation Disney covered them up with musical numbers and kept the story moving along. I have heard a couple of ""huh?""s in the audience during these moments. The plot felt a little muddled at times as well, as if Disney had too many good ideas and decided to add in subplots here and there. There is first the whole ""fear is your enemy"" storyline, then the ""true love"" storyline, then the ""eternal winter"" storyline? It did feel a little muddled to be honest.Nevertheless, during your first viewing you would probably be too engrossed with the movie to care. Frozen is a great achievement with a solid cast, soundtrack and fantastic animation. It has a very entertaining pace that will guarantee a few laughs along the way. It is a great family movie that will leave you with a smile on your face and a song on your lips.","['frozen', 'basically', 'everything', 'fun', 'family', 'movie', 'cute', 'character', 'great',

That was me in the 90s when ""Aladdin"" came out; I didn't actually see it until several months after it came out on DVD and left the New Releases wall for the regular movies of the rental place. After I saw it, I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen and was quoting and singing the songs afterward. Same thing happened with ""Frozen."" I didn't rent this until long after it was no longer a New Release, and I have to admit, it really is infectious without being obnoxious (Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast""). It's a modern fairy tale loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" about the sisters Anna and Elsa, who seems to have a mystical ability to create ice. When Elsa's power is discovered after keeping it secret for years, she flees her home and creates an ice palace in the mountains, unaware the snow storms left in her wake are destroying the land. The songs are unavoidably memorable, the characters and voices are excellent and the plot moves forward evenly, barely sagging or slowing at any moment. What it is is an icy version of ""The Little Mermaid"" for the new generation, and one movie like ""Aladdin"" I wouldn't mind having in my collection.","['ever', 'around', 'movie', 'everyone', 'like', 'whose', 'endorsement', 'promotion', 'explode', 'everywhere', 'yet', 'reticent', 'go', 'see', 'theater', 'aladdin', 'come', 'actually', 'see', 'several', 'month', 'come', 'dvd', 'left', 'new', 'release', 'wall', 'regular', 'movie', 'rental', 'place', 'saw', 'thought', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'see', 'quote', 'sing', 'song', 'afterward', 'thing', 'happen', 'frozen', 'rent', 'long', 'longer', 'new', 'release', 'admit', 'really', 'infectious', 'without', 'obnoxious', 'disney', 'beauty', 'beast', 'modern', 'fairy', 'tale', 'loosely', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'sister', 'anna', 'elsa', 'seem', 'mystical', 'ability', 'create', 'ice', 'elsa', 'power', 'discover', 'keep', 'secret', 'year', 'flees', 'home', 'creates', 'ice', 'palace', 'mountain', 'unaware', 'snow', 'storm', 'left', 'wake', 'destroy', 'land', 'song', 'unavoidably', 'memorable', 'character', 'voice', 'excellent', 'plot', 'move', 'forward', 'evenly', 'barely', 'sag', 'slow', 'moment', 'icy', 'version', 'little', 'mermaid', 'new', 'generation', 'one', 'movie', 'like', 'aladdin', 'mind', 'collection']","[81, 200, 1, 109, 9, 620, 3118, 2794, 879, 182, 13, 16, 312, 485, 40, 103, 16, 608, 860, 40, 540, 330, 108, 288, 1201, 1466, 1, 3881, 188, 157, 92, 10, 34, 1, 81, 16, 1774, 63, 11, 3850, 43, 290, 5, 1605, 169, 612, 108, 288, 637, 22, 3839, 137, 1717, 2, 149, 203, 324, 219, 114, 696, 256, 44, 245, 339, 39, 49, 15, 7, 4, 75, 1542, 367, 134, 33, 4, 24, 987, 154, 508, 47, 710, 533, 797, 33, 383, 214, 2290, 39, 713, 330, 1238, 1839, 757, 11, 268, 8, 86, 298, 52, 242, 571, 944, 1065, 133, 453, 435, 48, 422, 108, 616, 10, 1, 9, 485, 320, 1327]"
1078,7,"My girl was born the same year than ""Frozen"", I don't think she'll ever recall her first experience with the film and that she used to dance and turn while singing ""let it go!"" over and over, but I suspect she'll still have enough toys or perfumes or plastic glasses reminding her, and indirectly her daddy, of the Frozen-mania that defined her childhood. So, it's not the movie lover or the Disney fan but the father of a little girl who'll review the film.Now, a simple question, did I enjoy it? I did, not as I enjoyed recent Disney films like ""Tangled"" to name this one, but I'm in no position to judge my personal enjoyment because in the end, millions of children (I suspect a vast majority of girls) went to see the film, it ended up being the highest grossing Disney movie ever, crossing the billion mark, and there are probably millions of two-year old Anna and Elsa who owe their name to ""Frozen"". So we're not reviewing a film, but a phenomenon.Indeed, just when we thought our eyes saw everything and that we had enough fairy tales stories for three generations, ""Frozen"" transcended its appellation as Disney animation, even inspiring a new term ""New Renaissance"", like a rebirth of Disney magic that the success of ""Inside Out"" confirmed. And it's such a smash hit that I wish I could be as enthusiastic as a witness of history in motion, but I can't because I didn't enjoy the film that much, but I understand why I didn't enjoy it and I understand it doesn't really matter. When a film is so successfully commercial, no constructive review can deny this one merit.That'll sound like an odd name-dropping in a Disney review but I saw an interview of French director Jean-Pierre Melville and he said that an artist must face the fact that his work of art is a product, and as a product, it's got to be successful. Not that an artist should compromise himself but the creation has to provide something tangible to the viewer, a sensation, a feeling, an effect, otherwise, it's a pointless effort. Watching ""Frozen"", I couldn't help but think what a smartly marketed film it was. It feels like your ordinary fairy tale; you get the castle, the princess, the Charming Prince, the kiss of true love, the funny sidekicks, but that's just the packaging, you ain't seen nothing till you really see it.We don't have one princess but two, two sisters, siblings' relationships have always been tense in Disney's films but in ""Frozen"", it's the soul of the story, Elsa is a princess gifted with the power of turning things into ice and snow with her fingers, but after an accident that almost caused her sister's death, she's locked away till her coronation on her 18th birthday. Anna is the free-spirited jovial little sister who has a love-at-first-sight moment with prince Hans. There is a lot of exposition before the story takes off, but we get very soon that we're not heading toward the conventional Disney story: there's something too 'convenient' about the Prince and as if Elsa felt it, she refuses to give her blessing for her sister's marriage claiming that she can't just marry someone she just met, thus throwing away decades of Disney teachings! But this is nothing compared to the revolution to come, there have been female protagonists 'leaving' their place: Ariel, Jasmine, Rapuntzel but when Anna leaves the castle, the town, her responsibilities, her musical number ""Let it Go"" strikes as a hymn to individuality and total purposeless freedom, some even saw there a subtle metaphor of coming-out. The writer and co-director Jennifer Lee said the film belongs to the public and any interpretation is welcome you bet, I want to say. This is the kind of ambiguity that can only hit the jackpot, the song is gutsy enough to be ambiguous, but the tone is still family friendly, it's a win-win. And it's so catchy that you just can't get it off your head. The film then ventures into very familiar territories, Anna looks for her sister, meets ice salesman Kristoff and his funny sidekick Sven and then, the quartet is completed with the adorable Olaf and I can't just resist him, if only because my daughter loves to hug Olaf-shaped pillows from furniture stores.""Frozen"" feels a little shaky though in the writing; Elsa is the heroine but she's the closest to an antagonist, so the only antagonist possible was Hans, and it was awkward to see him turning into such a hateful bastard while he looked sincere in his introductory scene. Still, he wasn't a villain to measure up with the film's ambitions, but was Kristoff any more important in the ""hero"" role? It's funny that such a movie so conscious of its 'significance', had needless characters story-wise (don't even get me started on the trolls) but you better believe the makers knew what they were doing, and I got it with the kiss of the true sisterly love that provided the happy end: ""Frozen"" was all about Elsa and Anna, two sisters maybe that was the closest to lovers a Disney film could get, it's just as if the script was written by Lisa Simpson (remember, Equalia?), Elsa and Anna instantly made Belle and Ariel look like Snow-White and Cinderella.Feminism, girl-power is the new message of animation and as a man, I'm getting a little tired of it. ""Frozen"" was so wrapped up in its message it affected the story, but I guess when you have a vision for a film and stick to it, it always pays off. I'm pretty sure that in 10-15 years, young women will be reminiscing about Anna and Elsa as the film will represent a pivotal part of their life and as a girl's daddy, I can't ignore it. ""Frozen"" simply knew how to be important.","['girl', 'born', 'year', 'frozen', 'think', 'ever', 'recall', 'first', 'experience', 'film', 'use', 'dance', 'turn', 'sing', 'let', 'go', 'suspect',

1079,8,"I enjoy Frozen and I think it's definitely one of Disney's best, but after seeing this film a few times, I started to know that there are flaws in the story and the characters. Most particularly, it would be Elsa. She said that she doesn't care anymore about how people would see her, as mentioned in the good but sometime overrated 'Let it Go' song, I don't hate the song and I understand its message and impact of pop culture. But there are times when people need to shut up with singing that song! Back to Elsa, she said she's doesn't care about what people think of her, but when her sister came over to help, she was still scared of being an outcast because of what've happened earlier, by revealing her frozen powers to the people. Another thing I don't like about Elsa was that the movie never explained how she got her powers in the first place, my guess they could open up to a prequel or a short film, depends on where Disney is going with it, but it seems to lack her character. Elsa is not a bad character, but not a great character too, though I do like that her love for her sister. Coming to the other characters like her young sister, Anna, I really find her great. She's feisty and fun but also good hearted. Olaf, I know many people might as well despise the comic relief character as being either being obnoxious and annoying, but I find his naive nature funny and charming and his song 'In Summer' in my opinion is nice and catchy. Kristoff is another good character, despite his own personal flaws, he was a nice guy to Anna's nature.The story is nice, but it's nowhere serious nor better then 'The Lion King'. TLK's storyline is very serious and shows us the meaning of life in the pride lands and yes I know people would say that TLK was 'the Frozen of the 90's', but there's a reason why TLK was much loved, because of its serious storyline. 'Frozen' has a good story and it shows that love for anyone can thaw everything, love for your sister is the example in the storyline. Plus the storyline does break many of Disney's barrier's such as 'girl and boy fall instantly in love with each other and get married, ignoring who they are.', we see the developing relationship between Anna and Kristoff and it does well. Although I wouldn't say it was the first that there's no man to save the princess or Queen, that to me belongs to 'Brave', yes it's a dud from Pixar, but I find it decent.The CGI animation looks amazing, the snowy landscape, Arendelle is amazing to look at as well. So Frozen is good, but it has its flaws and I won't call it an instant classic and I do see why some people can call this movie overrated, that's if they've seen it and not finding it be 'cool'. But it's definitely one of Disney's good ones with its characters, story and animation.","['enjoy', 'frozen', 'think', 'definitely', 'one', 'disney', 'best', 'see', 'film', 'time', 'start', 'know', 'flaw', 'story', 'character', 'particularly', 'would', 'elsa', 'say', 'care', 'anymore', 'people', 'would', 'see', 'mention', 'good', 'sometime', 'overrate', 'let', 'go', 'song', 'hate', 'song', 'understand', 'message', 'impact', 'pop', 'culture', 'time', 'people', 'need', 'shut', 'sing', 'song', 'back', 'elsa', 'say', 'care', 'people', 'think', 'sister', 'come', 'help', 'still', 'scar', 'outcast', 'happen', 'earlier', 'reveal', 'frozen', 'power', 'people', 'another', 'thing', 'like', 'elsa', 'movie', 'never', 'explain', 'get', 'power', 'first', 'place', 'guess', 'could', 'open', 'prequel', 'short', 'film', 'depends', 'disney', 'go', 'seem', 'lack', 'character', 'elsa', 'bad', 'character', 'great', 'character', 'though', 'like', 'love', 'sister', 'come', 'character', 'like', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'really', 'find', 'great', 'feisty', 'fun', 'also', 'good', 'hearted', 'olaf', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'might', 'well', 'despise', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'either', 'obnoxious', 'annoy', 'find', 'naive', 'nature', 'funny', 'charm', 'song', 'summer', 'opinion', 'nice', 'catchy', 'kristoff', 'another', 'good', 'character', 'despite', 'personal', 'flaw', 'nice', 'guy', 'anna', 'nature', 'story', 'nice', 'nowhere', 'serious', 'well', 'lion', 'king', 'tlk', 'storyline', 'serious', 'show', 'u', 'meaning', 'life', 'pride', 'land', 'yes', 'know', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'tlk', 'frozen', 'reason', 'tlk', 'much', 'love', 'serious', 'storyline', 'frozen', 'good', 'story', 'show', 'love', 'anyone', 'thaw', 'everything', 'love', 'sister', 'example', 'storyline', 'plus', 'storyline', 'break', 'many', 'disney', 'barrier', 'girl', 'boy', 'fall', 'instantly', 'love', 'get', 'married', 'ignore', 'see', 'develop', 'relationship', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'well', 'although', 'say', 'first', 'man', 'save', 'princess', 'queen', 'belongs', 'brave', 'yes', 'dud', 'pixar', 'find', 'decent', 'cgi', 'animation', 'look', 'amaze', 'snowy', 'landscape', 'arendelle', 'amaze', 'look', 'well', 'frozen', 'good', 'flaw', 'call', 'instant', 'classic', 'see', 'people', 'call', 'movie', 'overrate', 'see', 'find', 'cool', 'definitely', 'one', 'disney', 'good', 'one', 'character', 'story', 'animation']","[91, 5, 37, 174, 10, 2, 34, 16, 3, 20, 120, 56, 386, 12, 8, 536, 26, 4, 35, 293, 892, 46, 26, 16, 348, 17, 2903, 426, 30, 13, 11, 333, 11, 216, 185, 1153, 658, 1034, 20, 46, 99, 686, 63, 11, 74, 4, 35, 293, 46, 37, 15, 40, 135, 68, 878, 2895, 290, 846, 528, 5, 24, 46, 102, 43, 9, 4, 1, 88, 400, 19, 24, 36, 188, 388, 54, 318, 4600, 263, 3, 3486, 2, 13, 75, 273, 8, 4, 65, 8, 25, 8, 100, 9, 6, 15, 40, 8, 9, 73, 15, 7, 22, 71, 25, 1651, 125, 27, 17, 1329, 32, 56, 61, 46, 252, 18, 2709, 309, 297, 8, 353, 1717, 238, 71, 1144, 1094, 85, 235, 11, 205, 258, 192, 266, 67, 102, 17, 8, 313, 537, 386, 192, 148, 7, 1094, 12, 192, 801, 835, 18, 152, 97, 4000, 295, 835, 78, 177, 672, 79, 757, 325, 56, 46, 26, 35, 4000, 5, 180, 4000, 31, 6, 835, 295, 5, 17, 12, 78, 6, 299, 775, 132, 6, 15, 396, 295, 569, 295, 340, 61, 2, 5138, 76, 408, 186, 1498, 6, 19, 895, 1079, 16, 917, 153, 7, 67, 18, 255, 35, 36, 145, 111, 29, 49, 2011, 335, 325, 3547, 194, 71, 546, 555, 21, 66, 96, 1218, 889, 199, 96, 66, 18, 5, 17, 386, 308, 982, 69, 16, 46, 308, 1, 426, 16, 71, 556, 174, 10, 2, 17, 10, 8, 12, 21]"
1080,10,"frozen is the best Disney movie ever the story is about na, a fearless optimist, sets off on an epic journey - teaming up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his loyal reindeer Sven - to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. From the outside Anna's sister, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret-she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful ability, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.the story is amazing the songs are amazing and let it go is the best song in the movie if you haven't seen this movie its a must watch and you will have a amazing time watching it!","['frozen', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'story', 'na', 'fearless', 'optimist', 'set', 'epic', 'journey', 'team', 'rugged', 'mountain', 'man', 'kristoff', 'loyal', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'find', 'sister', 'elsa', 'whose', 'icy', 'power', 'trap', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'eternal', 'winter', 'encounter', 'everest', 'like', 'condition', 'mystical', 'troll', 'hilarious', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'anna', 'kristoff', 'battle', 'element', 'race', 'save', 'kingdom', 'outside', 'anna', 'sister', 'elsa', 'look', 'poise', 'regal', 'reserve', 'reality', 'life', 'fear', 'wrestle', 'mighty', 'secret', 'born', 'power', 'create', 'ice', 'snow', 'beautiful', 'ability', 'also', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'haunt', 'moment', 'magic', 'nearly', 'kill', 'young', 'sister', 'anna', 'elsa', 'isolated', 'spending', 'every', 'wake', 'minute', 'try', 'suppress', 'grow', 'power', 'mount', 'emotion', 'trigger', 'magic', 'accidentally', 'set', 'eternal', 'winter', 'stop', 'fear', 'become', 'monster', 'one', 'even', 'sister', 'help', 'story', 'amaze', 'song', 'amaze', 'let', 'go', 'best', 'song', 'movie', 'see', 'movie', 'must', 'watch', 'amaze', 'time', 'watch']","[5, 34, 2, 1, 81, 12, 2777, 1434, 2019, 144, 566, 337, 486, 1371, 214, 145, 67, 1502, 151, 181, 71, 15, 4, 620, 453, 24, 900, 77, 199, 310, 105, 951, 2020, 9, 1100, 1542, 123, 364, 45, 183, 32, 7, 67, 1435, 401, 1224, 111, 77, 769, 7, 15, 4, 66, 2184, 3028, 1313, 940, 79, 187, 4195, 2664, 508, 589, 24, 134, 33, 39, 93, 367, 27, 423, 702, 2665, 133, 150, 501, 286, 73, 15, 7, 4, 782, 1407, 115, 1238, 211, 87, 1885, 285, 24, 4196, 240, 2666, 150, 300, 144, 310, 105, 284, 187, 179, 495, 10, 28, 15, 135, 12, 96, 11, 96, 30, 13, 34, 11, 1, 16, 1, 236, 23, 96, 20, 23]"

1082,9,"Frozen is an animated Disney movie that was released on November 27, 2013. It was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, and features the voices of Kristen Bell, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, and Idina Menzel. In the movie, Princess Anna of Arendelle teams up with Kristoff the ice salesman, his pet reindeer Sven, and an amusing snowman named Olaf to find her sister Elsa who has sent their kingdom into an eternal winter with her magical powers. Frozen has won 32 awards, including a Golden Globe, and is nominated for 2 Oscars. With it's Broadway style songs and innovative key message, Frozen is one of Disney's best musicals. One of the best parts of Frozen is the music. Throughout the movie, each song provides the right amount of drama or comic relief needed. In his review of Frozen, Perry Seibert from TV Guide said, ""What makes Frozen far and away the most entertaining Disney musical in quite sometime is that the married songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson- Lopez have put together a set of reasonably ambitious songs that not only have pleasant melodies, but are matched with lyrics that are humorous while revealing character"" (tvguide.com). Paired with the voice of Broadway star Idina Menzel, their song ""Let It Go"" was guaranteed to be a hit. The songwriters also created the perfect moment of comic relief with the song ""In Summer"" in which lovable Olaf, played by Josh Gad, expresses his dream to feel the warmth of summer and to ""do whatever snow does in summer."" The success of ""Let It Go"", ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"", and ""In Summer"" along with the rest of the soundtrack quickly led Disney to re-release Frozen as a sing-along version on January 31, 2013.Throughout the movie, there are countless surprises and messages. For instance, the message that you should not rush into things or judge people solely on your first impression of them is hinted at throughout the entire movie. However, the most important message is not brought up until the very end. This is the message about the importance of sisterhood and family. When discussing the messages of the movie, Christy Lemire wrote, ""the biggie— the one that's a real game-changer in terms of the sorts of messages Disney animated classics have sent for decades—is the one that's important not just for the little girls in the audience, but for all viewers"" (rogerebert.com). Lemire is talking about the importance of family. Contrary to most Disney princesses, Anna and Elsa show the world that family is more important than finding Prince Charming. Anna has the opportunity to have her happily ever after with Kristoff—her Prince Charming—but instead she sacrifices herself to save her sister. By doing this, she makes the biggest act of true love—not one for a guy, but one for family. With this innovative ending, Disney shows people everywhere that girls are not just damsels in distress waiting for their prince to rescue them. Instead, they illustrated that girls have the power to save themselves. While all of the characters thought that Anna needed a guy to thaw her frozen heart, she had the ability to perform an act of true love and heal herself.Overall, Frozen is one of Disney's greatest musicals due to its hit songs and unique message. Each song provides just the right amount of drama or humor for the character and the scene. The soundtrack topped the Billboard album chart for four weeks. Frozen also sent a wonderful message to the entire audience about the importance of family and showed that girls do not need a Prince Charming.","['frozen', 'animate', 'disney', 'movie', 'release', 'november', 'direct', 'chris', 'buck', 'jennifer', 'lee', 'feature', 'voice', 'kristen', 'bell', 'josh', 'gad', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'idina', 'menzel', 'movie', 'princess', 'anna', 'arendelle', 'team', 'kristoff', 'ice', 'salesman', 'pet', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'amuse', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'find', 'sister', 'elsa', 'sent', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'magical', 'power', 'frozen', 'award', 'include', 'golden', 'globe', 'nominate', 'oscar', 'broadway', 'style', 'song', 'innovative', 'key', 'message', 'frozen', 'one', 'disney', 'best', 'musical', 'one', 'best', 'part', 'frozen', 'music', 'throughout', 'movie', 'song', 'provide', 'right', 'amount', 'drama', 'comic', 'relief', 'need', 'review', 'frozen', 'perry', 'seibert', 'tv', 'guide', 'say', 'make', 'frozen', 'far', 'away', 'entertain', 'disney', 'musical', 'quite', 'sometime', 'married', 'songwriting', 'team', 'robert', 'lopez', 'kristen', 'anderson', 'lopez', 'put', 'together', 'set', 'reasonably', 'ambitious', 'song', 'pleasant', 'melody', 'match', 'lyric', 'humorous', 'reveal', 'character', 'tvguide', 'com', 'pair', 'voice', 'broadway', 'star', 'idina', 'menzel', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'guaranteed', 'hit', 'songwriter', 'also', 'create', 'perfect', 'moment', 'comic', 'relief', 'song', 'summer', 'lovable', 'olaf', 'played', 'josh', 'gad', 'express', 'dream', 'feel', 'warmth', 'summer', 'whatever', 'snow', 'summer', 'success', 'let', 'go', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'summer', 'along', 'rest', 'soundtrack', 'quickly', 'lead', 'disney', 'release', 'frozen', 'sing', 'along', 'version', 'january', 'throughout', 'movie', 'countless', 'surprise', 'message', 'instance', 'message', 'rush', 'thing', 'judge', 'people', 'solely', 'first', 'impression', 'hint', 'throughout', 'entire', 'movie', 'however', 'important', 'message', 'brought', 'end', 'message', 'importance', 'sisterhood', 'family', 'discuss', 'message', 'movie', 'christy', 'lemire', 'write', 'biggie', 'one', 'real', 'game', 'changer', 'term', 'sort', 'message', 'disney', 'animate', 'classic', 'sent', 'decade', 'one', 'important', 'little', 'girl', 'audience', 'viewer', 'rogerebert', 'com', 'lemire', 'talk', 'importance', 'family', 'contrary', 'disney', 'princess', 'anna', 'elsa', 'show', 'world', 'family', 'important', 'find', 'prince', 'charm', 'anna', 'opportunity', 'happily', 'ever', 'kristoff', 'prince', 'charm', 'instead', 'sacrifice', 'save', 'sister', 'make', 'big', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'one', 'guy', 'one', 'family', 'innovative', 'end', 'disney', 'show', 'people', 'everywhere', 'girl', 'damsel', 'distress', 'wait', 'prince', 'rescue', 'instead', 'illustrate', 'girl', 'power', 'save', 'character', 'thought', 'anna', 'need', 'guy', 'thaw', 'frozen', 'heart', 'ability', 'perform', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'heal', 'overall', 'frozen', 'one', 'disney', 'great', 'musical', 'due', 'hit', 'song', 'unique', 'message', 'song', 'provide', 'right', 'amount', 'drama', 'humor', 'character', 'scene', 'soundtrack', 'topped', 'billboard', 'album', 'chart', 'four', 'week', 'frozen', 'also', 'sent', 'wonderful', 'message', 'entire', 'audience', 'importance', 'family', 'show', 'girl', 'need', 'prince', 'charm']","[5, 38, 2, 1, 288, 1581, 721, 526, 490, 464, 416, 229, 86, 162, 146, 275, 257, 455, 377, 141, 116, 1, 29, 7, 199, 486, 67, 33, 1443, 983, 151, 181, 828, 45, 183, 32, 71, 15, 4, 1606, 77, 310, 105, 170, 24, 5, 469, 349, 796, 1521, 1463, 302, 411, 355, 11, 1831, 1165, 185, 5, 10, 2, 34, 51, 10, 34, 94, 5, 58, 296, 1, 11, 458, 130, 624, 745, 309, 297, 99, 161, 5, 1059, 1727, 35, 14, 5, 142, 101, 243, 2, 51, 124, 2903, 895, 3428, 486, 1421, 928, 162, 467, 928, 196, 332, 144, 2458, 2028, 11, 978, 1186, 553, 475, 1135, 528, 8, 968, 1441, 86, 411, 249, 141, 116, 11, 30, 13, 2924, 234, 3090, 27, 134, 175, 133, 309, 297, 11, 205, 726, 32, 507, 275, 257, 1099, 626, 53, 1324, 205, 653, 39, 205, 577, 30, 13, 59, 202, 45, 205, 172, 303, 225, 733, 248, 2, 288, 5, 63, 172, 435, 296, 1, 1820, 445, 185, 1758, 185, 525, 43, 1592, 46, 2649, 36, 1118, 1281, 296, 264, 1, 110, 289, 185, 599, 41, 185, 1259, 861, 72, 3312, 185, 1, 5238, 165, 10, 195, 925, 5227, 657, 539, 185, 2, 38, 69, 1606, 492, 10, 289, 48, 76, 159, 479, 968, 5238, 178, 1259, 72, 2842, 2, 29, 7, 4, 78, 126, 72, 289, 71, 82, 235, 7, 759, 795, 81, 67, 82, 235, 208, 635, 111, 15, 14, 106, 112, 62, 6, 10, 148, 10, 72, 1831, 41, 2, 78, 46, 879, 76, 1492, 1563, 415, 82, 1518, 208, 3354, 76, 24, 111, 8, 92, 7, 99, 148, 775, 5, 80, 367, 1332, 112, 62, 6, 1234, 166, 5, 10, 2, 25, 51, 404, 234, 11, 414, 185, 11, 458, 130, 624, 745, 222, 8, 90, 225, 3811, 3812, 2254, 4729, 784, 1078, 5, 27, 1606, 215, 185, 264, 159, 1259, 72, 78, 76, 99, 82, 235]"
1083,9,"I wasn't too eager about seeing Frozen, but once I actually saw it, I loved it! I didn't think Tangled was as fantastic as the hype suggested, which led me to believe that Frozen would turn out the same - I was mistaken. Frozen is a movie that looks trite based on the trailer, but is actually highly original, funny, and even moving. I had the mistaken idea that the leading protagonist, Anna, and her sister, Elsa, were enemies. Rather than venturing into the ""evil step/sister"" cliché, this movie ventures deep into the relationship between the two sisters through the use of substantial character development. I saw true emotion and sisterly love between Anna and Elsa; they obviously cared deeply about each other. That's a type of love that one seldom sees in animated films, whether it be Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks. No, love between two characters is typically shown as a romance between the heroine and hero. In this case, however, we see a strong bond between two well-developed characters that doesn't rely on cliché. Aside from well-developed characters, this movie had a very unique script, both dialogue and plot. There was enough humor and clever jokes to make me laugh several times throughout the movie. That being said, the jokes weren't forced in any way, and always arrived when necessary, and stayed away when unnecessary. I loved how the humor was gauged perfectly at the middle-ground, where kids, teens, and adults alike could laugh. Last but not least, I'd like to say that there were several songs throughout this movie - more than I was expecting for sure, but DON'T let that turn you away from seeing it! The songs were very well done; the lyrics were great and the voices were superb. All in all, this was a great Disney movie, and easily one of the best animated movies in the last few years. I highly recommend.","['eager', 'see', 'frozen', 'actually', 'saw', 'love', 'think', 'tangle', 'fantastic', 'hype', 'suggest', 'lead', 'believe', 'frozen', 'would', 'turn', 'mistaken', 'frozen', 'movie', 'look', 'trite', 'base', 'trailer', 'actually', 'highly', 'original', 'funny', 'even', 'move', 'mistaken', 'idea', 'lead', 'protagonist', 'anna', 'sister', 'elsa', 'enemy', 'rather', 'venture', 'evil', 'step', 'sister', 'clich', 'movie', 'venture', 'deep', 'relationship', 'two', 'sister', 'use', 'substantial', 'character', 'development', 'saw', 'true', 'emotion', 'sisterly', 'love', 'anna', 'elsa', 'obviously', 'care', 'deeply', 'type', 'love', 'one', 'seldom', 'see', 'animate', 'film', 'whether', 'disney', 'pixar', 'dreamworks', 'love', 'two', 'character', 'typically', 'show', 'romance', 'heroine', 'hero', 'case', 'however', 'see', 'strong', 'bond', 'two', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'rely', 'clich', 'aside', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'movie', 'unique', 'script', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'enough', 'humor', 'clever', 'joke', 'make', 'laugh', 'several', 'time', 'throughout', 'movie', 'say', 'joke', 'force', 'way', 'always', 'arrive', 'necessary', 'stayed', 'away', 'unnecessary', 'love', 'humor', 'gauge', 'perfectly', 'middle', 'ground', 'kid', 'teen', 'adult', 'alike', 'could', 'laugh', 'last', 'least', 'like', 'say', 'several', 'song', 'throughout', 'movie', 'expect', 'sure', 'let', 'turn', 'away', 'see', 'song', 'well', 'lyric', 'great', 'voice', 'superb', 'great', 'disney', 'movie', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'animate', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'highly', 'recommend']","[3320, 16, 5, 103, 157, 6, 37, 83, 253, 406, 1049, 248, 220, 5, 26, 113, 3261, 5, 1, 66, 2144, 256, 394, 103, 472, 230, 85, 28, 242, 3261, 281, 248, 354, 7, 15, 4, 1570, 191, 1991, 277, 668, 15, 274, 1, 1991, 574, 153, 42, 15, 158, 2574, 8, 356, 157, 62, 240, 711, 6, 7, 4, 613, 293, 1368, 524, 6, 10, 4170, 16, 38, 3, 638, 2, 194, 1035, 6, 42, 8, 1782, 78, 363, 565, 544, 514, 110, 16, 167, 482, 42, 18, 610, 8, 1299, 274, 716, 18, 610, 8, 1, 414, 395, 719, 52, 164, 222, 691, 451, 14, 190, 608, 20, 296, 1, 35, 451, 272, 50, 163, 1912, 1496, 2039, 101, 845, 6, 222, 5239, 456, 962, 1051, 60, 1457, 147, 725, 54, 190, 197, 250, 9, 35, 608, 11, 296, 1, 131, 207, 30, 113, 101, 16, 11, 18, 475, 25, 86, 904, 25, 2, 1, 403, 10, 34, 38, 1, 197, 47, 472, 262]"
1084,9,"As a Disney fan both as a child and 21 year old college film student, I was hesitate to see this film. It seemed to be marketing itself towards a female audience and as a single male with no children, I really didn't see a point in going to see it.Than the critical praise came out, people saying it was Disney's best film since ""Beauty and Beast."" Well since Beauty and The Beast is in my opinion a flawless film, I had to see this for myself to satisfy my curiosity on whether or not it would live up to such standards.While the film does indeed cater to ""sisters, couples, and girls"" it doesn't alienate it's male audience either and for that I applaud it. While I wouldn't say it's a flawless film, it is indeed up there as one of Disney's most well crafted films since the Disney Renaissance era.I suppose I should start with all the positive and than explain the small section of negative. So here goes.....Well first off I really enjoyed one of the main messages of the film, which I took as being ""true love isn't instant."" In the film; two characters meet, they sing a song in classic Disney fashion (Which borders almost on parody of itself) and decide to get married. But then the film raises the question of whether or not they're just rushing it and whether or not that is a good thing to do. It's nice to see one of the characters actually display some form of common-sense in this situation and I enjoyed the stab at Disney's own clichés and also raising a good message to kids that really isn't addressed as much as it probably should be. For that alone, I give this film huge props.In fact a lot of things this film does brings a great sense of originality to the Disney formula. For example, we actually have a great play on the ""Talking animal"" cliché, with a character doing the talking for the animal instead. They could have just made the animal talk, but instead they got a little creative and that makes the cliché less lazy and more original and unique.I also enjoyed that the comical relief character isn't just a character we meet on the journey who joins the group just to be a comical relief character, he actually has a bit of a history with the two lead characters. It would have been easy to just bring him in and have him be there for the sake of just providing laughs. But by grounding his existence with the lead characters it gives his own purpose a little more weight and legitimacy. Once again, they could have taken the lazy approach to him, but didn't and I applaud this film for doing that.Also, so glad that the romantic subplot is put aside and instead the film chose to focus more on the relationship with the sisters. That's where the heart of this movie is (possible pun intended) and it was a smart move to play the best cards they had. The relationship with the sisters is pretty flawless, both are unique and have different character flaws that ground them and make them feel more real. Yet both love each other and showcase that love by fighting through their flaws together. The romantic stuff is still there, but it's mostly put on the sideline without feeling too forced or unneeded.The voice acting is also really fantastic. I never once recognized an actors voice, which was really great because that really brought the characters more to life and made them feel more legit. I never once thought ""Oh wow, Kristen Bell is a great singer"", instead I found myself thinking ""Wow, Anna is a great singer.""Animation.....top-notch....nuff said.Now I did say this film wasn't flawless, but don't think this means it's a bad film. My only two flaws are very minor and don't ruin the film on a whole.The first problem I had was that one of the songs felt completely unneeded and kinda ruined the pace of the film at the beginning. It almost felt squished in there and I felt that a non-lyrical musical montage like that famous scene in Pixar's UP (Another flawless film) would have made that scene more effective. It wasn't a bad song; in fact it was one of the better ones, but it would have been better left on the cutting room floor.The second flaw is that the villain in the film was introduced so late in the movie that I didn't have time to grow to hate him. If this film followed Alfred Hitchcock's rule of suspense (Showing the audience a bomb that the characters are unaware of, is more suspenseful than just having the bomb go off surprisingly) than that would have made the villain more vile and disgusting. I saw this film with my mother (who saw it once before) and she said that she did hate the villain more the second time viewing the film because she knew who the villain was. Which only proves my point. I usually hate obvious villains, but in this case it would have been better that way.Other than those two minor flaws, the film is fantastic. It's got a great message, some catchy songs, good developed characters, solid voice acting, and is really smart at avoiding or being aware of the classical Disney formula that it's trying to live up to.This feels like a huge step in the right direction for Disney and I can only hope that more films like this are to come.9 out 10 (Perfect for audiences young or old)","['disney', 'fan', 'child',

1090,8,"The film tells the story of a pair of princess sisters forced to separate and meet again. Elder sister Elsa is born with snow magic, but after she accidentally injured her sister Anna once, she had a fear of her magic and could not overcome the magic. In order not to hurt her loved ones, she hides and escapes, but this makes her heart more lonely and fearful. The lively and cheerful Anna, who is always looking for true love, always shows her the most honest side. She does not know why her sister always hides from herself. The film actually follows a classic story path-pushing misunderstandings into the abyss and then filling it with love. In fact, the emotional bond between the sisters has never disappeared. Even if they have not spoken for several years, even if the two are apart, they all firmly believe that each other still cherish each other. When Elsa ran away to the top of the snow mountain, the song ""LET IT GO"" she sang pushed the film to the climax. She abandoned all her worries and worries at this moment. When she created a ladder to the top of the mountain with magic, and when a snow castle was miraculously built with the melody of music, every audience seemed to put The depression and unhappiness in life from my own mind are put aside. Let it go, let them go! Let the heart untie the shackles! In fact, Elsa created two snowmen with magic: one is the little snowman Olaf who longs for summer, and it greets Anna in the jungle; the other is A terrifying and fierce snow giant, it drove Anna out of the ice castle. Olaf was inadvertently created by Elsa and Anna when they were children. It is also a symbol of the friendship between the two people, and the Snow Giant is a manifestation of Elsa's fear and resistance to the world. It is worth mentioning that in the end, the film really fulfilled Olaf 's desire to enjoy the summer. This incredible also made every audience feel the magical power of Disney animation will dream to achieve. Aside from the digression, Olaf reminds me of the domestic animation ""Snow Child"" because the snowman is always used to express friendship, and this intention can only be sublimated when it melts. The power of true love is powerful, it can wake up the cold heart, and this true love has the biggest true love besides love is affection. It seems that the film uses this as the central idea to create a warmth in ice and snow. The pursuit of true feelings and the pursuit of warmth, even Olaf is also dreaming of the happy scene in the summer, such creative imagination abounds Yes. The warm and true love praised by the film is also in line with our modern world view. Human nature is kind. Many of the coldness and hypocrisy hidden in the heart are passively imposed, but they are ultimately dominated by themselves. Those souls stationed in the body tacitly guide our words and deeds. Love, emotion, kindness, truth, each element is part of the composition of the soul, it can change the environment in which we live and affect the space in which we live. Let love more every day, we will live happier and warmer every day , The environment in which we live will change as we please.","['film', 'tell', 'story', 'pair', 'princess', 'sister', 'force', 'separate', 'meet', 'elder', 'sister', 'elsa', 'born', 'snow', 'magic', 'accidentally', 'injured', 'sister', 'anna', 'fear', 'magic', 'could', 'overcome', 'magic', 'order', 'hurt', 'love', 'one', 'hide', 'escape', 'make', 'heart', 'lonely', 'fearful', 'lively', 'cheerful', 'anna', 'always', 'look', 'true', 'love', 'always', 'show', 'honest', 'side', 'know', 'sister', 'always', 'hide', 'film', 'actually', 'follow', 'classic', 'story', 'path', 'push', 'misunderstanding', 'abyss', 'fill', 'love', 'fact', 'emotional', 'bond', 'sister', 'never', 'disappear', 'even', 'spoken', 'several', 'year', 'even', 'two', 'apart', 'firmly', 'believe', 'still', 'cherish', 'elsa', 'ran', 'away', 'top', 'snow', 'mountain', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'sang', 'push', 'film', 'climax', 'abandon', 'worry', 'worry', 'moment', 'create', 'ladder', 'top', 'mountain', 'magic', 'snow', 'castle', 'miraculously', 'built', 'melody', 'music', 'every', 'audience', 'seem', 'put', 'depression', 'unhappiness', 'life', 'mind', 'put', 'aside', 'let', 'go', 'let', 'go', 'let', 'heart', 'untie', 'shackle', 'fact', 'elsa', 'create', 'two', 'snowman', 'magic', 'one', 'little', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'longs', 'summer', 'greets', 'anna', 'jungle', 'terrify', 'fierce', 'snow', 'giant', 'drove', 'anna', 'ice', 'castle', 'olaf', 'inadvertently', 'create', 'elsa', 'anna', 'child', 'also', 'symbol', 'friendship', 'two', 'people', 'snow', 'giant', 'manifestation', 'elsa', 'fear', 'resistance', 'world', 'worth', 'mention', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'fulfil', 'olaf', 'desire', 'enjoy', 'summer', 'incredible', 'also', 'make', 'every', 'audience', 'feel', 'magical', 'power', 'disney', 'animation', 'dream', 'achieve', 'aside', 'digression', 'olaf', 'reminds', 'domestic', 'animation', 'snow', 'child', 'snowman', 'always', 'use', 'express', 'friendship', 'intention', 'sublimate', 'melt', 'power', 'true', 'love', 'powerful', 'wake', 'cold', 'heart', 'true', 'love', 'big', 'true', 'love', 'besides', 'love', 'affection', 'seem', 'film', 'us', 'central', 'idea', 'create', 'warmth', 'ice', 'snow', 'pursuit', 'true', 'feeling', 'pursuit', 'warmth', 'even', 'olaf', 'also', 'dream', 'happy', 'scene', 'summer', 'creative', 'imagination', 'abounds', 'yes', 'warm', 'true', 'love', 'praise', 'film', 'also', 'line', 'modern', 'world', 'view', 'human', 'nature', 'kind', 'many', 'coldness', 'hypocrisy', 'hidden', 'heart', 'passively', 'impose', 'ultimately', 'dominate', 'soul', 'station', 'body', 'tacitly', 'guide', 'word', 'deed', 'love', 'emotion', 'kindness', 'truth', 'element', 'part', 'composition', 'soul', 'change', 'environment', 'live', 'affect', 'space', 'live', 'let', 'love', 'every', 'day', 'live', 'happier', 'warmer', 'every', 'day', 'environment', 'live', 'change', 'please']","[3, 143, 12, 1441, 29, 15, 272, 786, 244, 1139, 15, 4, 589, 39, 150, 300, 2521, 15, 7, 187, 150, 54, 1009, 150, 496, 305, 6, 10, 676, 950, 14, 80, 930, 1604, 1559, 1638, 7, 163, 66, 62, 6, 163, 78, 742, 387, 56, 15, 163, 676, 3, 103, 378, 69, 12, 1347, 809, 481, 6, 201, 342, 482, 15, 88, 2543, 28, 1903, 608, 47, 28, 42, 512, 3178, 220, 68, 4, 1476, 101, 239, 39, 214, 11, 30, 13, 1142, 809, 3, 792, 1622, 1177, 1177, 133, 134, 5223, 239, 214, 150, 39, 168, 3988, 787, 1186, 58, 115, 159, 75, 196, 4852, 79, 320, 196, 716, 30, 13, 30, 13, 30, 80, 4678, 201, 4, 134, 42, 45, 150, 10, 48, 45, 32, 2863, 205, 7, 1799, 1649, 3507, 39, 1171, 3464, 7, 33, 168, 32, 1274, 134, 4, 7, 70, 27, 3528, 1003, 42, 46, 39, 1171, 5183, 4, 187, 126, 254, 348, 41, 3, 22, 2116, 32, 1070, 91, 205, 549, 27, 14, 115, 159, 53, 170, 24, 2, 21, 626, 1531, 716, 32, 1044, 5082, 21, 39, 70, 45, 163, 158, 1099, 1003, 1659, 359, 24, 62, 6, 439, 1238, 366, 80, 62, 6, 106, 62, 6, 877, 6, 1333, 75, 3, 919, 1061, 281, 134, 1324, 33, 39, 2553, 62, 680, 2553, 1324, 28, 32, 27, 626, 301, 90, 205, 1014, 1251, 3491, 325, 362, 62, 6, 535, 3, 27, 213, 324, 126, 413, 515, 1094, 193, 61, 994, 80, 5137, 941, 2731, 1074, 2689, 1220, 1727, 548, 3614, 6, 240, 2566, 1690, 401, 94, 2524, 1074, 209, 1147, 224, 1076, 1628, 224, 30, 6, 115, 138, 224, 3103, 115, 138, 1147, 224, 209, 576]"

1093,10,"This movie really blew my socks off, but not for the ideas that are commended. The way this movie really threw me off was the fact that Disney would vow against its natural roots of prescribed romance and silly-fun free songs. Sure this movie is filled with the classic ""pure Disney joy"", but this movie features some very mature themes that I was to shocked to see as I endured the film. Nevertheless, the casting, the songs, the story, is mere to perfection and is truly one of if not the best Disney Princess movie ever made.The film opens to a series of Ice Workers and a little boy with his pet reindeer, learning the ways of Ice and its dangers (""Vuellie/Frozen Heart""). The movie then is set to the kingdom of Arendelle with Anna, the youngest sister plans to play with her older sister Elsa, using her ice magic. With Anna being very carefree and Elsa being logical, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna in the head with ice, making her go unconscious. The King and Queen take Anna to Grand Pabbie, the leader of the magic trolls, who take away all memory of Elsa having powers. He also warns Elsa of the dangers that come with her mystical ice powers.Elsa is forced to be segregated from Anna and the rest of the world, due to the fear of being exiled. Anna eagerly awaits to see Elsa and for years upon years asks her to play and just be normal sisters (""Do You Want To Build A Snowman?""). At age 18, The King and Queen go aboard a ship to an unknown destination, but are capsized. Three years later, Elsa is titled ""Queen of Arendelle"" For she is the eldest daughter. She plans a massive coronation and allows the whole town to attend, finally opening up the gates in a decade. Anna eagerly awaits to see the outside world, while Elsa fears to keep her powers under control (""For The First Time In Forever"").As Anna (Kristen Bell) roams the streets of Arendelle, she meets Hans Of the Southern Isles (Santino Fontana). Anna believes it to be true love and eagerly waits until the coronation so she can see him and Elsa once more. At Elsas coronation, Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna rekindle their sisterly love for one and other, while Anna goes off with Hans as he proposes to her (""Love Is An Open Door""). The couple announces their engagement to Elsa, but she becomes infuriated and accidentally lets her powers slip. Elsa runs off in a panic towards the north mountain, but realizes she is free from all worries and troubles (""Let It Go"").Anna sets off to find Elsa, leaving Hans in charge of the kingdom until she returns. Elsa has accidentally put summer to a halt and made it an eternal winter. In need of rejuvenation and supplies, Anna stops at a chalet, where she meets Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), a salesman of Ice, in need of winter supplies. Kristoff and his Reindeer, Sven, are kicked out of the chalet and find a place to stay for the night (""Reindeers Are Better Than People""). Anna, having heard that Kristoff knows his way around the woods, offers to purchase his products in exchange for a trip up the north mountain. Kristoff reluctantly agrees.The next day, the trio find themselves in a winter wonderland, and encounter a talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). Olaf dreams about what his life would be like in the summer sun (""In Summer""). Back in the kingdom, Hans appears worried for there has been no return of Anna or Elsa. He leaves the Duke of Wessleton in charge while he and other soldiers go off to find her. Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven arrive at Elsa's Ice Palace, where Anna attempts to make all correct, assuming Elsa knows how to reverse the curse. Elsa, frightened, accidentally freezes Anna's heart and Anna leaves infuriated (""For The First Time In Forever (Reprise)"")After being chased by Elsas kingdom guard, Marshmallow, Kristoff, unsure of what just occurred takes Anna and the group to ""the love experts"", which end up being the same trolls from before. It is revealed that Kristoff was the son of Ice Sellers, but was adopted by the trolls. Grand Pabbie warns Kristoff and states ""only an act of true love can reverse what Elsa has done to poor Anna"". The trolls state how Kristoff should be the sole true love, but Anna disagrees (""Fixer Upper""). The group rides back to Arendelle, hoping from an embrace from Hans. Meanwhile, Hans and the soldiers arrive at the ice palace and successfully capture Elsa.Elsa wakes up in a dungeon, being chained to the walls, incapable of using her powers. Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven arrive at the palace and deliver her safely to Hans. However, instead of showing an act of true love, Hans turns the tables and ends up stating that he only attempted to use Anna for her wealth and social hierarchy. Elsa successfully escapes from the dungeon, while Olaf finds Anna, dying, and attempts to find Kristoff, with Kristoff trying to find Anna. As Hans attempts to murder Elsa, Anna stops the event before freezing to a solid statue. Elsa cries over Anna's frozen body stating ""I love you"". Miraculously, Anna defrosts and Elsa realizes that the way to reverse the curse is through love. The gates of the kingdom are permanently opened, as Hans and the Duke are deported back to their homelands. Elsa decides to use her powers for good, and finds ways to control it.Wow. What an obscure, abstract plot shown beautifully through stunning animation. As much as there is a stigma with this and the sequel how there is barely any villain, I could argue that the villain of this film is not Hans, but maybe ones mental health. Elsa is mature yet stubborn, while Anna is immature yet selfless. The fear of growing up and creating new relationships is really the message Disney hopes to convey throughout the film. The music is fantastic, the story is gut wrenching, you will not leave this film with a dry eye, and also, it is just a fantastic film for any age, something Disney does extremely well.My final verdict: Frozen gets a 10.","['movie', 'really', 'blew', 'sock', 'idea', 'commend', 'way', 'movie', 'really', 'threw', 'fact', 'disney', 'would', 'vow', 'natural', 'root', 'prescribed', 'romance',

1094,7,"Every once in awhile you find something that's not your style and not the type of thing that you're normally interested in, and yet somehow you seem to like it. For me, ""Frozen"" is a good example of this. As a 36 year old man, I don't usually watch fairy tale type movies anymore (the only reason why I saw this is because I was a substitute counselor at a summer camp and this was one of the movies they showed the kids). There are some things about it that I don't like, particularly the stuff with the trolls. Is the movie overrated? I would say so. But overall I think it's a great film with some really unique story elements and intriguing music, particularly ""Let It Go"".I think it's interesting that the blizzard and chaos is caused not by the bad character, but rather by a good character who just doesn't know how to control it.But what really makes it unique is how Anna is saved from the cold spell at the end. (Note that there are spoilers here). She is told that in order to save herself she needs an act of true love. It looks like it's just another one of those old stories where a princess needs a kiss from a man (a concept I have never liked). But in complete contrast to traditional fairy tale stories, it turns out to be something very different, in that instead of needing true love from another person, what she really needs is to perform an act of true love to someone else (or at least that's what ends up happening). It's a very special scene in that while she is literally dying from the cold she sees Kristoff coming and thinks that he is her only chance to survive. But at the same time the wicked prince Hans is about to kill her sister. So she has to make a decision of either save herself, or try to save Elsa, and she ultimately chooses the latter. She literally gives her life to try to save her sister. Giving your life for someone else is the greatest act of love that anyone can possibly do. The fact that she even still loves her sister at all after all the trouble she has caused makes it even more commendable. In a sense this sort of makes Anna a good example to follow (although she also makes some foolish decisions as well). The only problem with this is that it's easy to misunderstand what saves her. After she turns into ice, Elsa hugs her, thinking she's dead. It's only natural that she would do this. The problem is that this gives the false impression that it was the hug from Elsa that saves her (rather than the expected kiss from a man). This was what I thought at first. Some friends of mine thought this too, and felt that this made it inappropriate. It would've been good if the snowman or somebody had explained this better.Unlike most people, I don't like romance stories. And while Frozen does contain some romance, I like it in that for once the romance is not what solves the problem at the end, and isn't really the main focus.","['every', 'awhile', 'find', 'something', 'style', 'type', 'thing', 'normally', 'interested', 'yet', 'somehow', 'seem', 'like', 'frozen', 'good', 'example', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'usually', 'watch', 'fairy', 'tale', 'type', 'movie', 'anymore', 'reason', 'saw', 'substitute', 'counselor', 'summer', 'camp', 'one', 'movie', 'show', 'kid', 'thing', 'like', 'particularly', 'stuff', 'troll', 'movie', 'overrate', 'would', 'say', 'overall', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'really', 'unique', 'story', 'element', 'intrigue', 'music', 'particularly', 'let', 'go', 'think', 'interest', 'blizzard', 'chaos', 'cause', 'bad', 'character', 'rather', 'good', 'character', 'know', 'control', 'really', 'make', 'unique', 'anna', 'save', 'cold', 'spell', 'end', 'note', 'spoiler', 'told', 'order', 'save', 'need', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'look', 'like', 'another', 'one', 'old', 'story', 'princess', 'need', 'kiss', 'man', 'concept', 'never', 'like', 'complete', 'contrast', 'traditional', 'fairy', 'tale', 'story', 'turn', 'something', 'different', 'instead', 'need', 'true', 'love', 'another', 'person', 'really', 'need', 'perform', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'least', 'end', 'happen', 'special', 'scene', 'literally', 'die', 'cold', 'see', 'kristoff', 'come', 'think', 'chance', 'survive', 'time', 'wicked', 'prince', 'han', 'kill', 'sister', 'make', 'decision', 'either', 'save', 'try', 'save', 'elsa', 'ultimately', 'chooses', 'latter', 'literally', 'give', 'life', 'try', 'save', 'sister', 'give', 'life', 'someone', 'else', 'great', 'act', 'love', 'anyone', 'possibly', 'fact', 'even', 'still', 'love', 'sister', 'trouble', 'cause', 'make', 'even', 'commendable', 'sense', 'sort', 'make', 'anna', 'good', 'example', 'follow', 'although', 'also', 'make', 'foolish', 'decision', 'well', 'problem', 'easy', 'misunderstand', 'save', 'turn', 'ice', 'elsa', 'hug', 'think', 'dead', 'natural', 'would', 'problem', 'give', 'false', 'impression', 'hug', 'elsa', 'save', 'rather', 'expect', 'kiss', 'man', 'thought', 'first', 'friend', 'mine', 'thought', 'felt', 'make', 'inappropriate', 'would', 'good', 'snowman', 'somebody', 'explain', 'well', 'unlike', 'people', 'like', 'romance', 'story', 'frozen', 'contain', 'romance', 'like', 'romance', 'solves', 'problem', 'end', 'really', 'main', 'focus']","[115, 3170, 71, 89, 355, 524, 43, 1297, 946, 182, 981, 75, 9, 5, 17, 396, 47, 64, 145, 460, 23, 219, 114, 524, 1, 892, 180, 157, 3210, 4541, 205, 3600, 10, 1, 78, 60, 43, 9, 536, 698, 123, 1, 426, 26, 35, 166, 37, 25, 3, 22, 414, 12, 401, 1723, 58, 536, 30, 13, 37, 122, 1508, 4857, 328, 65, 8, 191, 17, 8, 56, 128, 22, 14, 414, 7, 111, 366, 858, 41, 625, 419, 511, 496, 111, 99, 112, 62, 6, 66, 9, 102, 10, 64, 12, 29, 99, 372, 145, 693, 88, 9, 656, 956, 462, 219, 114, 12, 113, 89, 140, 208, 99, 62, 6, 102, 441, 22, 99, 1332, 112, 62, 6, 304, 270, 250, 41, 290, 316, 90, 643, 368, 366, 16, 67, 40, 37, 632, 2615, 20, 678, 82, 44, 286, 15, 14, 758, 353, 111, 87, 111, 4, 941, 3331, 955, 643, 57, 79, 87, 111, 15, 57, 79, 304, 270, 25, 112, 6, 299, 842, 201, 28, 68, 6, 15, 1073, 328, 14, 28, 3098, 217, 539, 14, 7, 17, 396, 378, 255, 27, 14, 2901, 758, 18, 198, 454, 3176, 111, 113, 33, 4, 1236, 37, 831, 1660, 26, 198, 57, 1950, 1118, 1236, 4, 111, 191, 131, 372, 145, 92, 36, 327, 2514, 92, 155, 14, 2072, 26, 17, 45, 1832, 400, 18, 766, 46, 9, 363, 12, 5, 1562, 363, 9, 363, 3313, 198, 41, 22, 119, 261]"

While Sbet was going back after he left Anna to the prince Hans, i thought oh, Its Sbet not Hans to kiss her! Beczuse I am so in the so called princess story that prince would come and find her in a sudden someday! So i wished Hans would marry to Anna, which makes me dislike the scene that trolls are trying for the marriage of Sbet and Anna. but! It twisted again! Sbet couldn't kiss her .... But Anna's true love was her sister Elsa...I loved the Hans fell in love with Anna not Elsa. if he did with Elsa then it is too obvious princess story like... Prince should fall in love with main character..! But later i felt so pathetic to the character of Elsa who suffered loneliness through her life until the end of the movie... He has no fiancé !! It was a bit dismaying....but i still love Disney movie and I am gonna watch it over and over again!!","['love', 'graphic', 'ice', 'castle', 'amaze', 'prove', 'would', 'never', 'disappointed', 'disney', 'show', 'lesson', 'true', 'love', 'well', 'twist', 'twice', 'like', 'sbet', 'go', 'back', 'left', 'anna', 'prince', 'han', 'thought', 'oh', 'sbet', 'han', 'kiss', 'beczuse', 'call', 'princess', 'story', 'prince', 'would', 'come', 'find', 'sudden', 'someday', 'wish', 'han', 'would', 'marry', 'anna', 'make', 'dislike', 'scene', 'troll', 'try', 'marriage', 'sbet', 'anna', 'twist', 'sbet', 'kiss', 'anna', 'true', 'love', 'sister', 'elsa', 'love', 'han', 'fell', 'love', 'anna', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'obvious', 'princess', 'story', 'like', 'prince', 'fall', 'love', 'main', 'character', 'later', 'felt', 'pathetic', 'character', 'elsa', 'suffer', 'loneliness', 'life', 'end', 'movie', 'fianc', 'bit', 'dismay', 'still', 'love', 'disney', 'movie', 'gon', 'watch']","[6, 714, 33, 168, 96, 799, 26, 88, 476, 2, 78, 499, 62, 6, 18, 129, 1227, 9, 3338, 13, 74, 330, 7, 82, 44, 92, 425, 3338, 44, 372, 308, 29, 12, 82, 26, 40, 71, 1072, 5214, 417, 44, 26, 390, 7, 14, 1116, 90, 123, 87, 1057, 3338, 7, 129, 3338, 372, 7, 62, 6, 15, 4, 6, 44, 843, 6, 7, 4, 4, 595, 29, 12, 9, 82, 186, 6, 119, 8, 358, 155, 1980, 8, 4, 888, 1505, 79, 41, 1, 1331, 95, 3175, 68, 6, 2, 1, 1360, 23]"
1097,7,"Frozen, a story of family, love and beating the odds. The movie starts out with the loss of parents, a fight between sisters and a town cast into a perpetual winter. Elsa, the queen of Arendelle, has been trying to keep her magical powers a secret. When Anna, Elsa's sister, and Elsa get into an argument over a potential engagement, Elsa's secret becomes public to the whole kingdom. This leads Elsa to isolate herself in the forest in an attempt to ""protect"" those she loves. Anna bands with a mountain man named Kristoff and his reindeer Sven, in an attempt to protect the kingdom. With twists, turns, and adventure throughout the movie. With a race against time Anna proves that an act of true love is what is needed to end the winter. In an attempt to safe her sister Anna almost gives her life. This ultimately leads to end the curse of the perpetual winter and the restoration of unity between sisters. Even though the summary of the movie seems like it would be a heart wrenching classic, Frozen's overall performance was quite mediocre. Starting with the positive aspects of the movie. One's expectations with a Disney Film would be flawless animation, this is where Frozen delivered. Throughout the film you can see articulate buildings, houses and castles fitting the Scandavian region the movie is depicting. The buildings were not the only thing that caught my eye, the patterns and colors in the clothing each character was wearing were beautifully elaborate. One of the amazing scenes took place when Elsa was created her castle with her powers, as each spiral rose up from the ground it created a glow that was immaculate. If the castle was created in real life, it would be classified as one of the great wonders of the world. The animators had a task in front of them with variety of different characters that would be in this film such has a human with magical powers, talking snowmen, rock trolls, giant snow creatures and many more. With each character they were able to create flowing movement, facial emotions and real life actions to give it the appeal that this could be real. I grew up singing along Disney movies such as The Lion King, The Jungle Book and other classics which sometimes you can still catch me singing today. The music in Frozen was very catchy and upbeat just like the Disney classics. At the same time it was a little different, it almost had a Broadway or musical feel as Elsa, Anna and others sang solos and duets. With this style of music, it aloud a greater audience then just little children it appeal to those who are fond musicals. While I was watching the movie I saw this little six year old girl who was singing every song, I couldn't help but smile and try to sing along. My girlfriend, who loves musicals like Wicked and Beauty and the Beast, loved the music so much that she went out at bought the sound track, she puts it in when she wants to be in a better mood or just to sing along. I believe that is what Disney is trying to get out of their movies, are happy feelings that make you want more.As in most Disney movies such as Finding Nemo, there seems to be a tragic start usually consisting of a death to a parent but this time it seemed to be almost wrong. Both parents were killed leaving behind two young girls to grow up in a castle by themselves due to Elsa's fear of hurting others with her magical powers. The two girls become isolated from each other, which the depiction of being held captive against their will for different reasons. A plot of murder, greed and lust is underlying in the movie with one of the characters. Is something that children should be exposed to at such an early age? I think not! You might as well let them watch Lone Survivor at least it had some deep moral value to the plot. When we think of Disney we think of romantic princess love stories like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White to name a couple but Frozen's love story was a disaster. Anna who wants nothing more to be in love, is betrayed by the man of her dreams. Not to mention that Elsa has no love romance in her life, even though she just became the queen of Arendelle. The end left you still sad about the whole situation that there wasn't a ""Happily Ever After"" ending that is Disney's trademark.I would say that this will not be one of the great Disney classics that everyone cherishes and passes down to their children. I was left with a sense of emptiness towards the whole film. I would give this film 2 out of 4 stars because I know that Disney is capable of so much more. You don't need to go to the movie instead go buy the soundtrack and sing out loud with you children, friends and even your girlfriend.","['frozen', 'story', 'family', 'love', 'beating', 'odds',

1098,8,"This latest Disney movie is a rather fun experience filled with beautiful animation and catchy tunes. Based on an imaginative new story, the film is directly aimed at young girls (and women who are young at heart), and has some surprisingly profound and sophisticated messages about emotions and relationships. That's not to say that young boys (and old coots who are not particularly young at heart) cannot enjoy the movie as well. I felt the movie really soared with the ""Let It Go"" number. This is when I sat up and thought, ""what the hell?"" It's difficult to dismiss or belittle Disney when it is able to present magical scenes like this on the screen. ""Fixer Upper"" and the love scene at the end were also uplifting.Else was in many ways the central character in the movie. I loved the fact that Disney resisted the temptation to make her an evil character, but rather turned her into the much more interesting persona that she is. After seeing it twice, I feel it's worth about 7.5, but I'm willing to round my score up to 8. One problem with this movie is that it is the chickest of chick flicks.","['late', 'disney', 'movie', 'rather', 'fun', 'experience', 'fill', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'catchy', 'tune', 'base', 'imaginative', 'new', 'story', 'film', 'directly', 'aim', 'young', 'girl', 'woman', 'young', 'heart', 'surprisingly', 'profound', 'sophisticated', 'message', 'emotion', 'relationship', 'say', 'young', 'boy', 'old', 'coot', 'particularly', 'young', 'heart', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'well', 'felt', 'movie', 'really', 'soar', 'let', 'go', 'number', 'sat', 'thought', 'hell', 'difficult', 'dismiss', 'belittle', 'disney', 'able', 'present', 'magical', 'scene', 'like', 'screen', 'fixer', 'upper', 'love', 'scene', 'end', 'also', 'uplift', 'else', 'many', 'way', 'central', 'character', 'movie', 'love', 'fact', 'disney', 'resist', 'temptation', 'make', 'evil', 'character', 'rather', 'turn', 'much', 'interest', 'persona', 'see', 'twice', 'feel', 'worth', 'willing', 'round', 'score', 'one', 'problem', 'movie', 'chickest', 'chick', 'flick']","[530, 2, 1, 191, 125, 334, 481, 93, 21, 266, 804, 256, 2194, 108, 12, 3, 2210, 859, 73, 76, 251, 73, 80, 1179, 1823, 2302, 185, 240, 153, 35, 73, 408, 64, 536, 73, 80, 91, 1, 18, 155, 1, 22, 3189, 30, 13, 184, 1196, 92, 778, 1113, 3870, 2, 294, 663, 170, 90, 9, 369, 772, 737, 6, 90, 41, 27, 1955, 270, 61, 50, 1061, 8, 1, 6, 201, 2, 2289, 14, 277, 8, 191, 113, 31, 122, 2654, 16, 1227, 53, 254, 1549, 911, 223, 10, 198, 1, 2038, 805]"
1099,9,"Overall, I loved watching this movie. It was thoroughly entertaining as a range emotional tones were explored and character development made for interesting dynamics and interactions.Touching on character development, I appreciate the snowman character, Olaf. I love the concept of his character not knowing the direct correlation of temperature to heat and him fantasizing about summer. And also appreciate that there's just enough of him for comic relief and endearment without digging a kitschy niche.Not sure how to feel about the common trend in animation for horses being caricatured as dogs thoughAs pertaining to the princesses, each princess' voice, and physical behavior are succinct with their personalities. The art is in the details. On that note though, realizing I can't expect much a detour from the traditional button-nose, doe-eye Disney Princess aesthetic, it just would've been nice. Especially since the movie's main plot is about overcoming adversity and accepting the inherent nature of being unique. Especially this and the animator's ability to render the main male characters more human, although similar and stylized.I think this movie works on the premise of the Bechdel test where 1. It has to have at least two named women in it, 2. Who talk to each other, 3. About something besides a man. I by no means use this as a end all/be all definer of wholesomeness or quality but I am glad Disney experiments with this kind female interaction as it is absent in almost all of their movies –usually any interactions are based on good versus evil, or they are at odds with one another since they do not see eye to eye and then only come together towards the end as they develop an understanding of one another. Which, you do see the latter in Frozen but in this instance it is different because conflict between the princesses is about how they will maintain peace and unity, which doesn't revolve around betrothal but rather a love for one another. Also, the viewer gets to see the back story of their childhood that sets an emotional intensity that allows meaningful investment of the viewer to how the story plays out.I am on the fence regarding how to feel about the robust likeness of Frozen being comparable to the musical, Wicked, with the adaptation potential to become a musical itself.

1100,6,"With ""Frozen"", Disney finally gives their audience their long awaited-version of Hans Christian Andersens ""The Snow Queen"". After being in development since Walt's early days, ""Snow Queen"" was finally officially green-lit after Tangled's release and been pretty much shaped by the same components that made ""Tangled"" so successful. Since then, ""Frozen"" has become Disney's biggest hit ever, even surpassing ""The Lion King"". As an avid Disney-fan, I'm glad that Disney's once again having an Golden Age, but it's a pity that ""Frozen"" is the film that has lifted Disney's reputation. While I don't consider ""Frozen"" to be a bad film, it's a far cry from Disney's best releases.Set in Norway, the film should probably have made me biased, considering that I'm a Norwegian myself. Fortunately Disney bring the Norwegian culture and landscape with grace and dignity. But while ""Frozen"" is a solid and watchable film, it's hampered the same problems that hampered both ""Tangled and ""Brave"". As with ""Brave"", the first half is is superior to the second half and the movie becomes generic afterwards (after ""Let It Go""). And as with ""Tangled"", the film is quite dramatically uneven and even more so than ""Tangled"", not blending the funny scenes and the quite darker scenes well.The second problem lies in a very busy plot. The plot line about Elsa's inner struggle and angst, as well as her and Anna's broken relationship, is enough for an entire movie. But the film also adds Anna's quest for true love (the main theme of the movie), as well as giving her two love interests, and one of them turning to be evil. I applaud the choice of having an evil Prince Charming for once, but it should have been in a story where it was actually needed, since Hans' sudden turn was contrived and not needed at all (and Hans had been a likable guy until then). Kristoff had the potential to been a deeper, more complex character, but he's just given the role as a loner for no particular deep reason at all.It's not that the sister relationship isn't the main focus on the movie, because it is. Although Disney has made a sister-relationship once before with ""Lilo & Stitch, at least that movie managed to take a sister dynamic to another level and portrayed real, dimensional characters. Elsa and Anna are just stereotypes with one trait. Anna is your typical plucky, spunky, naive and endearing Disney Princess (pretty much an amalgam of the traits of previous Disney heroines) and is given most of the spotlight. The other sister, Elsa, is the Snow Queen herself and your typical misunderstood Disney outcast. But since she's reduced to being a secondary protagonist, she's given less screen time and therefore less characterization. Elsa's character is a relatable metaphor for depressed and angsty people. I'm not trying to turn this into an Anna vs. Elsa debate, but since Elsa is after all the main catalyst for the events, she should have been the main protagonist and the film should have been primarily her story. With ""Frozen"", Menken has been replaced by the songwriting team Bobby and Kristen Lopez. Three of their songs work really well; the lovely anthem ""Let It Go"", the wonderful ""For the First Time in Forever"" and ""Frozen Heart"". The rest of the songs are not awful, but quite forgettable. However, less successful is Christophe Becks score, which unfortunately is quite generic and unremarkable. While there are a few hints of authentic Norwegian folk music in the score, it's still a missed opportunity to make a score entirely based on Norwegian folk music.Now it may sound that I detest this movie, cause I don't. The visuals were stunningly gorgeous and takes CGI visuals to a new level. The first half manage to engage and Hans' and Anna's romance is quite skillfully executed for a Disney couple. Olaf manages to light up the scenes that he's present and is surprisingly endearing. Co-directed by Chris Buck, he manage to bring the cuteness factor that was quite present in ""Tarzan"". The voice acting is mostly fine and little Sven is the most cutest thing ever. However, the character designs on the humans are disappointingly generic and barely resemble a Disney design.At the end, ""Frozen"" is a somewhat enjoyable and solid, but not particularly memorable Disney film. But on the positive side, it has made sure that Disney is hip again on the general masses. Let's hope this reputation will last this time.","['frozen', 'disney', 'finally', 'give', 'audience', 'long', 'await', 'version', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'development',

Also, the song ""fixer upper"" wasn't good, and they could have just deleted it from the movie. Also, the comedy - the comedy made this movie kind of less good, but not that much. And the ending: TOO happy. I'm not always in the mood for happy endings, but sometimes I can, but this was just TOO happy.

1105,8,"Frozen, from my opinion, is by far the most realistic Disney movies that Disney has ever created. It is very important to keep in mind that a good animated movie does not lie only or simply on fantasy, it must also include some sort of realistic components, because your audience are all different in terms of age. More importantly, your audience will grow up and get old. Hence, if you want your audience to have the motivation to re- watch the animated movie when they get old, your animated movie must have some realistic components in which the audience can still learn and relate to even though they get older. That's the reason why adults or teenagers are no longer a fan of Pokemon, yet they can be a great fan for Frozen. OK, so let's get to the point, why Frozen is so successful? There are 2 reasons. The first reason is because it brings out the message that Disney fails to bring out for a very long time - that true love does not simply refers to the love between man and woman. If you look back at the movies that Disney has filmed the past decades, you will see almost all directors focus on the power of love between guys and girls. I mean, of course, there are other films that focus on other types of love, but Frozen really nailed it. It demonstrates that true love does not only exists between boys and girls, but also between sisters/siblings. In fact, I think this is a better theme to educate children because I never think its appropriate to teach girls (especially girls that are still in elementary school) that they should have those ""prince's fantasies"". I mean, its fine if they have them, but these fantasies should not be encouraged. Therefore, this unique message that true love also can be referred to love between siblings is very powerful and outstanding. Another reason I think Frozen is an amazing movie is because it brings out a very realistic message: ""You cannot just marry a man you just met"". To be honest, this is very ironic, because most of the films that Disney has created in the past really emphasizes on this topic. Look at the little mermaid, Ariel didn't even talk to the prince and she's willing to sacrifice herself for him. I mean, sure they lived happily ever after, but is this true in real life? I think Frozen does a really good job on waking up these ""innocent girls"". I always like to suggest improvements for movies, and yes, even though Frozen is awesome, yet it for sure has room to improve. I cannot comment on the animation stuff because I am no expert in that field, however, I do like to comment about the plot/message behind the movie. As I said before, the messages behind the movies are excellent: ""Love can allow us to overcome fear, it can give warmth to others emotionally"" ""True love also means love between siblings"" etc. There are many themes going on in this movie, however, I think there are two themes should be further emphasized. The first theme is the principle that ""More power comes with more responsibility"". This theme is kind of subtle, or probably not even highlighted in the movie, but I personally think this is a great theme to add on to, I will probably mention this in the beginning of the movie and just do a little repetition at the end to connect this theme to the audience explicitly. I think this theme is important because its realistic, allowing the audience to be aware that Queen Elsa although can control her powers and live happily ever after with her sister etc, she now has more responsibility that she did in the past as she can control her powers. So I think this point should be further emphasized. Another theme that should be highlighted is the idea that ""Sacrifices are sometimes required to hold a friendship together"". This is a very important theme, yet very hard to bring out because few Disney movies dare to put the protagonists to death. The image or concept of death is always discouraged for children, especially for protagonists. Lion King is probably an exception, so yes, if I were to bring out this theme, I will probably edit the plot and Olaf must die at the end to sacrifice for the sisters. It was briefly mentioned in the plot that Olaf attempted to save the sisters by sacrificing himself, but the focus of that part is quickly shifted, which I found to be reasonable, but its a slight disappointment from an older audience's point of view. Apart from this theme, I mean, its true the children will be sad if they knew Olaf is melted at the end, but its also important to understand another theme. All snowman will melt when spring comes, it is sad that snowman melts and can't be kept forever, but it is also more important to keep in mind that if they don't melt and stay all year round, then building a snowman will not be as fun because you can build them whenever you want then. Its really rare to have a nice weather/right type/amount of snow to build a snowman, and its the rare chance of building a snowman that makes building a snowman fun.","['frozen', 'opinion', 'far',

1106,7,"And now, Disney's highest grossing animated film to date since The Lion King, Frozen. Disney decided to go back to the princess fairy tale formula with musical numbers. When it came out, people went NUTS. It was a huge hit. Critics loved it, audiences loved it and it crossed over $1,000,000,000 worldwide. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I think it's kinda overrated. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie; I just don't think I'd say this is one of Disney's greatest projects ever made. Ironically, Frozen has been in the works since Walt Disney himself was alive and the project was canceled numerous times, with scripts being rewritten, film crew shifting around, it just couldn't get out to the public until now. And now here it is. Here's the story.Sisters Anna and Elsa are the children of the king and queen of Arendelle. But it turns out, Elsa has cryokinesis—the ability to create snow and ice at her will. One day while playing, Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her powers and the king and queen decide that in order to save her, they need to erase Anna's memories of Elsa's power with the help from some trolls, who then tell Elsa that if her cryokinesis gets out of hand, it could mean disaster for all. The king and queen lock the gates to the castle so no one would know about this and try their best to teach Elsa to control her powers. Anna tries to connect with Elsa, who constantly blows her off to keep her safe. A decade later, the king and queen die due to Disney Parent Syndrome, leaving Elsa to rule as queen. At Elsa's coronation, her cryokinesis is discovered and everyone thinks she's a freak. Elsa runs away and decides to start a new life. So now, it's up to Anna to reconcile with her sister and save Arendelle from being eternally frozen while coming across colorful characters along the way.So yeah, pretty big story, huh? Yeah, everyone was totally digging this story and so was I. Okay where exactly does it fall flat? I can tell you in one word and this going to be a shock for some of youElsa. I found Elsa to be selfish. I mean, yeah, I get it. She's tortured by the fact that her powers are getting unstable and she's worried about killing Anna. Fair enough, but when she runs away and builds her fortress of solitude, she's also saying goodbye to Anna, her only FAMILY LEFT. FOREVER. And does she ever mention her? Nope. She's so absorbed in her own troubles, she doesn't care about anything. And when Elsa sees her own sister again after so many years of shutting her out, what does she say? A casual ""hi"". And when Anna finds her to tell her to take responsibility and face her fears, not only does she refuse, not only does she freeze her heart, she builds a giant snow monster to that NEARLY KILLS HER! Yeah, sister of the year, everyone! What also bothers me is that a lot of people say that Elsa is so inspirational and a great model. I think people got that mixed up with Anna. Yeah, ANNA is the great model. Anna is a very likable character. She's clumsy, but she admits it. She makes mistakes, but is willing to take responsibility for them. She cares for her sister so much and was willing to put her life on the line just for her. Hell, SHE was the one who saved all of Arendelle, when we should want Elsa to overcome her hardships, but she never did until she saw her sister sacrificed herself. Wouldn't it have been SO much more interesting if Elsa said ""you know what? Screw this. Anna's my sister and I'm going back?"" I'm sorry, but this is a HUGE flaw.Alright, so Elsa's character is a mess. How are the others? I think Kristoff is bland. The minute we see him, we know who he's going to be. He's going to be the love interest for Anna and that's it. He doesn't advance the story, so what's the point of him? Cut him out and you won't miss anything.What about the songs? They'reokay. Frozen Heart, Do You Wanna Build a Snowman? and For the First Time in Forever are good, but the others don't do much for me. Love is an Open Door? Hated. Fixer-Upper? Hated. Let it Go? It'snice to listen to. Not a huge fan, but I'd give it a pass.Okay, I'm done bashing on it. What DO I like? The animation. Praising animation by Disney is typical, but really the animation is GREAT. Look at the ice, that really does look like ice. And the entire Let it Go sequence is GLORIOUS. Watching the ice forming the castle is just breathtaking. Also, the snowman, Olaf, is a likable character. He's lighthearted, he's optimistic and he's actually funny at times. And he's willing to die for the main characters That's awesome. Go snowman.So in conclusion, Frozen can be a bit of a mess, but I do have a soft spot for it. I think the strong moments are really good. The first ten minutes of the movie are really solid. Like when Elsa yells for her parents for help at the beginning; that was really good. I do like this movie, I just have my own personal problems with it. I don't hate it, but it does pretty damaging flaws. When it comes on again, I'll check it out again. If you see it on DVD and Blu-Ray, give it a viewing and see for yourself.","['disney', 'high', 'gross', 'animate', 'film', 'date', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'frozen', 'disney', 'decide', 'go', 'back',

1107,6,"Frozen is a love story but not a story about romantic love. Its a story about acceptance and love within the family, more particularly a story about a love between two very different sisters.Though I like the story, so much more could've been done and I feel like there are several misfires as far as the story is concerned. We have Anna the youngest, the very extroverted, and bubbly sister; and then we have Elsa the very introverted and insecure of the two. Their relationship has been severed because of Elsa's inability to control her winter powers. After having unintentionally hurting her own sister when they were children she is forced into isolation and shuts Anna out after Anna's memories of Elsa's winter powers have been erased from her mind. From that moment Elsa has always been told to ""conceal not feel, don't let them see, don't let them know."" It isn't until they're older during Elsa's coronation that her powers are revealed to everyone and is treated like a witch. Elsa then runs away into further isolation into the mountains thus begins the plot of Anna going to get her sister back.Here's where I have a problem. We have two main characters Elsa and Anna. Anna is looked at as the primary main character and Elsa is secondary, this is a mistake. Elsa's character was setup so well she was complex and interesting. She's full of insecurities, she's unsure about herself. She was so very different from what we usually get when it comes to the Disney princess. Usually what we get with our fellow Disney princesses are the perky, spunky, feisty, some-day-my-prince-will-come- types.There is a great turning point for her character that is shown in the ""Let it go"" musical sequence. The message during the song being I may be alone but I'm free to do what I want I don't have to hide who I am anymore. Its after this sequence and her transformation that you kind of want to see more of her you want to know what kind of person she's going to be now, now that she has free reign of her power. Instead what we get is Anna going on an adventure with a guy named Kristoff,his reindeer Sven, and the comic relief, a talking snowman named Olaf. Everyone knows what purpose Kristoff serves but before I talk about him heres some previous information I forgot to mention. During Elsa's coronation Anna tries to get Elsa's blessing to marry a man she just met who goes by the name of Hans. Elsa says she can't because you can't marry a man you just met. Anna says you can if its true love. They argue and this is what triggered Elsa to release her powers in the first place and into her isolated frozen palace.So Kristoff is obviously meant to be Anna's real true love but I didn't care I didn't care about their relationship at all. I would've been okay with this if the role of the romantic interest had been given to Elsa. That would've been a good story right there, kind of like Beauty and the Beast only this time the Beauty is the Beast and the guy could show Elsa that she is someone worth loving. That's something I can see audiences rooting for. Anna and Kristoff is just okay whatever. Also, its like this if you're doing a story about mending a bond between sisters do our main characters even need a romantic interest? No not really. I mean I can see why they put it there for the sake of the plot twist but it still would've worked without it.The resolution of Elsa figuring out how to get Arrendale out of eternal winter was just.stupid and it was. In Disney films when something goes wrong and the hero has to fix it the answer is always ""true love"" or ""true love's kiss"" in the case of Anna and Elsa okay fine that works I was okay with that but to get Arrendale out of eternal winter? ""Love will thaw""? that's the answer? No explanation? So Elsa just has to feel extreme love or something and the snow will melt? Deus ex machina much?Overall despite my feelings about the story, visually the movie is absolutely stunning you can tell the animators really went the extra mile. The music and songs were also fantastic it was my favorite thing about this film. I wouldn't be surprised if this was turned into a live action Broadway musical. These elements alone make the movie worth watching.","['frozen', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'acceptance', 'love', 'within', 'family', 'particularly', 'story', 'love',

1108,8,"I absolutely adored the movie Frozen. It was such a whimsical and cute movie. I loved how it was not your typical Disney storyline: prince and princess meet, fall in love at first sight, their love saves the day. Instead it was the story about a tortured girl who was scared of her own power.

1110,8,"I'm not massively well acquainted with Disney animation. I don't dislike the films at all, but I've seen fewer animations recently so I haven't seen so many. Frozen has taken the world by storm and become the highest grossing animated film ever, so eventually I had to see what the fuss was about. A princess goes to find her sister after her sister's icy powers trapped the kingdom in an eternal winter, encountering some other interesting characters along the way. Frozen didn't quite live up to the hype. It has a couple of dips and is just another Disney film. It doesn't deviate from the Disney formula that much. I agree. Let It Go. However, Frozen still exceeded my expectations. The animation, although the characters look a bit weird, is dazzling. The songs are all catchy and the scenes in which they are performed are full of energy and charisma. The famous Let It Go sequence, although I don't quite get why the song was so universally loved, is still an awesome song and has a good message.The reason for Frozen's success isn't Let It Go. The reason it's a good film is because it's an involving, affecting and well written screenplay with moving messages, some (though not many) subversions of Disney clichés- especially with the main villain- and the various moving messages throughout. The way the act of true love which saves the main character is the love between sisters instead of the love between prince and princess is unexpected and clever. Also, the film has various suspenseful set pieces and in general it's a strong storyline. It may not entirely deserve the universal critical acclaim but it's the only memorable animated film to come out of 2013 and completely deserved the Oscar. ""Some people are worth melting for"" is the best line of dialogue to come out of 2013 in my opinion and Frozen is proof a secondary Disney renaissance may possibly be on the horizon. Frozen is a strong animated effort, although due to the hype it may not live up to expectations for new viewers, and will be a good winter movie in future.8/10","['massively', 'well', 'acquaint', 'disney', 'animation', 'dislike', 'film', 'see', 'animation', 'recently', 'see', 'many', 'frozen', 'take', 'world', 'storm', 'become', 'high', 'gross', 'animate', 'film', 'ever', 'eventually', 'see', 'fuss', 'princess', 'go', 'find', 'sister', 'sister', 'icy', 'power', 'trap', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'encounter', 'interest', 'character', 'along', 'way', 'frozen', 'quite', 'live', 'hype', 'couple', 'dip', 'another', 'disney', 'film', 'deviate', 'disney', 'formula', 'much', 'agree', 'let', 'go', 'however', 'frozen', 'still', 'exceed', 'expectation', 'animation', 'although', 'character', 'look', 'bit', 'weird', 'dazzle', 'song', 'catchy', 'scene', 'perform', 'full', 'energy', 'charisma', 'famous', 'let', 'go', 'sequence', 'although', 'quite', 'get', 'song', 'universally', 'love', 'still', 'awesome', 'song', 'good', 'message', 'reason', 'frozen', 'success', 'let', 'go', 'reason', 'good', 'film', 'involve', 'affect', 'well', 'write', 'screenplay', 'move', 'message', 'though', 'many', 'subversion', 'disney', 'clich', 'especially', 'main', 'villain', 'various', 'move', 'message', 'throughout', 'way', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'save', 'main', 'character', 'love', 'sister', 'instead', 'love', 'prince', 'princess', 'unexpected', 'clever', 'also', 'film', 'various', 'suspenseful', 'set', 'piece', 'general', 'strong', 'storyline', 'may', 'entirely', 'deserve', 'universal', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'memorable', 'animate', 'film', 'come', 'completely', 'deserve', 'oscar', 'people', 'worth', 'melt', 'best', 'line', 'dialogue', 'come', 'opinion', 'frozen', 'proof', 'secondary', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'may', 'possibly', 'horizon', 'frozen', 'strong', 'animate', 'effort', 'although', 'due', 'hype', 'may', 'live', 'expectation', 'new', 'viewer', 'good', 'winter', 'movie', 'future']","[2984, 18, 2, 21, 1116, 3, 16, 21, 1253, 16, 61, 5, 55, 126, 713, 179, 206, 783, 38, 3, 81, 652, 16, 2141, 29, 13, 71, 15, 15, 453, 24, 900, 77, 310, 105, 951, 122, 8, 172, 50, 5, 124, 224, 406, 398, 102, 2, 3, 3326, 2, 534, 31, 729, 30, 13, 110, 5, 68, 1669, 452, 21, 255, 8, 66, 95, 1063, 1786, 11, 266, 90, 1332, 246, 1338, 2382, 903, 30, 13, 502, 255, 124, 19, 11, 3791, 6, 68, 338, 11, 17, 185, 180, 5, 577, 30, 13, 180, 17, 3, 584, 1076, 18, 165, 1027, 242, 185, 100, 61, 3017, 2, 274, 121, 119, 104, 1131, 242, 185, 296, 50, 112, 62, 6, 111, 119, 8, 6, 15, 208, 6, 82, 29, 894, 691, 27, 3, 1131, 2797, 144, 588, 623, 167, 295, 171, 1083, 483, 3298, 1458, 1942, 268, 38, 3, 40, 291, 483, 302, 46, 254, 359, 34, 213, 719, 40, 258, 5, 3135, 1665, 2, 465, 171, 842, 5, 167, 38, 575, 255, 404, 406, 171, 224, 452, 108, 479, 17, 105, 1, 607]"

This movie just takes a new degree on animation and experience. I am moved by how Anna saved her sister and how Elsa was trying to protect her as well... The next topic I want to talk about are the Trolls. I personally think that those Trolls played an important part in the movie mainly because they bring a totally different aspect of imagination and add some fantasy taste to the movie as well. The last thing I want to say is the 'love will thaw' stuff. Other people say that protecting Anna is already love but it's not something like loving herself or the place, she never thought about that!

1112,6,"Leave it to Walt Disney Studios to kickoff the holiday season with a fun, joyful winter movie! Disney's Frozen is a fun filled movie that focuses on two princesses who had been separated for the majority of their lives. The two princesses were sisters, and, at birth, one sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), was born normal, while the other, Elsa (Idina Menzel) was cursed with the ability to control winter.At a young age, Anna and Elsa would use Elsa's power at a toy, playing with it for fun. One day, Anna was injured by Elsa's powers and her life was in jeopardy. Her parents took Anna to the magic trolls to save her. The trolls save the princess' life, and then wipe her memory of Elsa's, as they thought it would be best she didn't know.Meanwhile, Anna and Elsa's parents lock Elsa in her bedroom until she can learn to control her ability. Unfortunately, Elsa never learns to control her powers, and is locked in her room until her parents are killed in a sea storm. Many years later, Elsa is old enough to be queen of the kingdom, but is afraid the people will learn of her powers.All these years, Anna had been alone, and searching for her one true love. When she learns that Queen Elsa is her sister and that Elsa has trapped the kingdom in eternal winter, she teams up with a man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and a snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), to find her sister and end winter.Frozen is a definite kid and family friendly movie. It has everything you would expect from a Disney movie, from the princess, to songs, to laughter left and right.

1114,7,"Over the last couple years Disney has failed to reproduce some of its classic story lines which are forever cemented in your heart. This film is relatively watchable with a pretty smooth flowing script and manages to distinguish itself from other films.However, there was no real suspense or heightened villainy in the film at all. We see Elsa's dangerous side of her power from a young age and yet also learn just a few minutes later it can be cured pretty easily by some rock/troll granddad. I like the fact Anna cant remember her powers as it adds an element of sadness and sorrow for Elsa. Immediately I was thinking that this would in turn lead to Elsa becoming more villainous after years of exile, but like the fact she remained true to heart. The whole love story between Kristoff and Anna is entirely predictable as most Disney relationships are, was just waiting for a problem with Hans- who I must say is one of the worst excuses for a hero-turned-villain ever. As I was saying, even after Anna's heart has been 'frozen' there doesn't seem to be any element of danger, its not true sadness when she becomes frozen for me as I'm just sat there waiting for an answer to present itself(in the form of self sacrifice). Somehow 30 seconds of people bowing their heads before Anna starts to thaw doesn't quite cut it. I know an act of true love is the answer but it just didn't seem to be the ending the film deserved. The only thing I can say is that I'm glad it wasn't another clichéd kiss. All in all, its the best film they've churned out lately, but nowhere near my top 10. Some of the songs are pretty good especially 'Let it Go' it has powerful lyrics and releases some of that sadness and sorrow we had for Elsa. Olaf is the brilliant kooky character the film needs.

1116,8,"I like Frozen. It's not the best Disney movie, but it's a very enjoyable experience for all audiences.The animation never ceases to amaze me. Disney truly has a very talented animation team. Every scene and location has a beautiful atmosphere, and most of the winter scenes are absolutely stunning. The characters are expertly animated as well, and all of them are very expressive and lifelike.And speaking of the characters, they're all very strong for the most part. Anna is easily my favorite, and possibly my favorite Disney princess. She's quirky and hilarious and goofy, and I have yet to meet someone who doesn't like her. Kristoff and Olaf are really enjoyable and funny, and the chemistry between them and Anna is very strong. Pre-twist Hans is also really charming and likable. The trolls can be fun too.Elsa is the only questionable character in this movie, as she feels starved for personality. She has a fantastic musical number, which displays what personality she has in an expertly crafted way. Unfortunately, that's really all that Elsa has here. I really do feel like Disney could have done a better job with her, but she's not a hindrance to the movie as a whole.In terms of the music, it's all really good. The score captures the tone and plot lines flawlessly. The opening title song in particular is very well done and just as iconic as the musical numbers. All of the songs in Frozen are catchy as hell and important plotwise, excepting one. Let It Go, Love Is An Open Door, and First Time In Forever are the best. The other songs, while still good, didn't quite hit those same highs though. The only song that is straight-up inappropriate tone-wise is the troll song.The story is decent as well. It's not overly complicated, nor is it simplistic. It feels just right. Considering the story was re-written at the last minute to make Elsa a hero rather than a villain, it's actually rather commendable.The only thing that makes no sense is the twist surrounding Hans. If the Hans twist was completely removed from the story, not too much would change. That's the only thing that would make the story better if it was completely nonexistent or taken out. If you removed that twist, the movie would be better off if you ask me.The theme of love between sisters and self-love is great, but it unfortunately doesn't really come out until the very end. However, when it does come out, it's rewarding despite a slight lack of build up.Overall, Frozen is good. It's not a masterpiece, but it's highly enjoyable for kids and adults alike. It's still popular all these years later, and it'll be interesting to see if it stands the test of time. It's not quite up there with the likes of The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast like some say, but it's still a very good Disney movie, and one of my favorites.","['like', 'frozen', 'best', 'disney', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'audience', 'animation', 'never', 'cease', 'amaze', 'disney', 'truly', 'talented', 'animation', 'team', 'every', 'scene', 'location', 'beautiful', 'atmosphere', 'winter', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'stun', 'character', 'expertly', 'animate', 'well', 'expressive', 'lifelike', 'speak', 'character', 'strong', 'part', 'anna', 'easily', 'favorite', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'disney', 'princess', 'quirky', 'hilarious', 'goofy', 'yet', 'meet', 'someone', 'like', 'kristoff', 'olaf', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'chemistry', 'anna', 'strong', 'pre', 'twist', 'han', 'also', 'really', 'charm', 'likable', 'troll', 'fun', 'elsa', 'questionable', 'character', 'movie', 'feel', 'starve', 'personality', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'number', 'display', 'personality', 'expertly', 'craft', 'way', 'unfortunately', 'really', 'elsa', 'really', 'feel', 'like', 'disney', 'could', 'well', 'job', 'hindrance', 'movie', 'whole', 'term', 'music', 'really', 'good', 'score', 'capture', 'tone', 'plot', 'line', 'flawlessly', 'opening', 'title', 'song', 'particular', 'well', 'iconic', 'musical', 'number', 'song', 'frozen', 'catchy', 'hell', 'important', 'plotwise', 'except', 'one', 'let', 'go', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'best', 'song', 'still', 'good', 'quite', 'hit', 'high', 'though', 'song', 'straight', 'inappropriate', 'tone', 'wise', 'troll', 'song', 'story', 'decent', 'well', 'overly', 'complicate', 'simplistic', 'feel', 'right', 'consider', 'story', 'write', 'last', 'minute', 'make', 'elsa', 'hero', 'rather', 'villain', 'actually', 'rather', 'commendable', 'thing', 'make', 'sense', 'twist', 'surround', 'han', 'han', 'twist', 'completely', 'remove', 'story', 'much', 'would', 'change', 'thing', 'would', 'make', 'story', 'well', 'completely', 'nonexistent', 'take', 'remove', 'twist', 'movie', 'would', 'well', 'ask', 'theme', 'love', 'sister', 'self', 'love', 'great', 'unfortunately', 'really', 'come', 'end', 'however', 'come', 'reward', 'despite', 'slight', 'lack', 'build', 'overall', 'frozen', 'good', 'masterpiece', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'kid', 'adult', 'alike', 'still', 'popular', 'year', 'later', 'interest', 'see', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'quite', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'beauty', 'beast', 'like', 'say', 'still', 'good', 'disney', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite']","[9, 5, 34, 2, 1, 306, 334, 159, 21, 88, 3304, 96, 2, 329, 1356, 21, 486, 115, 90, 2276, 93, 1380, 105, 90, 292, 315, 8, 3638, 38, 18, 3793, 3985, 641, 8, 167, 94, 7, 403, 189, 842, 189, 2, 29, 908, 364, 961, 182, 244, 304, 9, 67, 32, 22, 306, 85, 1005, 7, 167, 1394, 129, 44, 27, 22, 235, 402, 123, 125, 4, 3299, 8, 1, 53, 407, 253, 51, 184, 1151, 407, 3638, 1021, 50, 573, 22, 4, 22, 53, 9, 2, 54, 18, 373, 4142, 1, 127, 657, 58, 22, 17, 223, 611, 627, 52, 213, 2444, 631, 590, 11, 650, 18, 1807, 51, 184, 11, 5, 266, 778, 289, 474, 10, 30, 13, 6, 318, 478, 36, 20, 287, 34, 11, 68, 17, 124, 234, 206, 100, 11, 984, 2072, 627, 1041, 123, 11, 12, 546, 18, 1200, 979, 1556, 53, 130, 421, 12, 165, 197, 211, 14, 4, 544, 191, 104, 103, 191, 3098, 43, 14, 217, 129, 1353, 44, 44, 129, 291, 1282, 12, 31, 26, 209, 43, 26, 14, 12, 18, 291, 5016, 55, 1282, 129, 1, 26, 18, 581, 226, 6, 15, 429, 6, 25, 573, 22, 40, 41, 110, 40, 2564, 313, 2117, 273, 202, 166, 5, 17, 461, 472, 306, 60, 147, 725, 68, 559, 47, 358, 122, 16, 361, 1279, 20, 124, 9, 152, 97, 149, 203, 9, 35, 68, 17, 2, 1, 10, 189]"

Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, and Josh Gad. The storyline plot is classic and stills persists in 2019 era of family and love. Blood is thicker than water. I enjoyed Idina Menzel's singing for the signature song ""Let It Go"" as she has great vocals coming from a Broadway background.

1118,9,"Out of all the animation studios out there, the only studio that can make perfect fairy tale movie is Walt Disney Animation Studios. Ever since making ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" in 1937, they have crafted fantastic movies with some great songs, beautiful animation, and memorable characters. Every other studio out there, including former Disney animator Don Blush, has tried to copy Disney's style and all have been very unsuccessful. If you want proof that Disney is the only studio that can do fairy tales well, then you should definitely watch ""Frozen"". Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's famous tale ""The Snow Queen"", ""Frozen"" embodies it's material with a very good story, gorgeous animation, funny characters and songs so memorable that you might have a very hard time trying to get them out of your head. Here's why the I think the film works, mainly because the story is really easy to explain.Two princesses, Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) live in a Scandinavian kingdom known as Arendelle. Elsa possesses the power to make snow and ice though is unable to control it which forces the kingdom to close its gates to the outside world and keep it a secret from Anna. Years pass and Elsa is crowned Queen of Arendelle and is force to open the gates to the outside world. However, after an incident with Anna, Elsa accidentally turns Arendelle's summer into a cold winter with her powers and isolates herself on top of a mountain. Hoping to bring her sister back, Anna entrusts the help of a ice maker named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), his reindeer Sven and a magic snowman made by Elsa named Olaf (Josh Gad).I really loved how the film decided to take a new approach to the Snow Queen story rather than actually attempting to do a full on adaptation. Disney has attempted to do an adaptation of the story for decades and most attempts have failed to materialize. It's a very simple story and like I mentioned before it's very easy to explain. Writer Jennifer Lee, who also wrote ""Wreck-It Ralph"", knew how to write the characters perfectly without making them feel weak or sexist. As for the animation, it's possibly some of Disney's best computer animation. The designs of the snow and ice are beautiful which lead to the film having some breathtaking backgrounds and eye popping colors. The characters are also a lot of fun. Anna's bubbly personality is perfectly matched with Kristen Bell's voice and I'm actually very surprised how well she can sing. I also really liked how they didn't make Elsa the villain of the story which could have been a lazily written character and pretty cliche. They even managed to give Olaf a few laughs without making him to annoying or irritating. And now, let's talk about the songs. They could easily rank as some of Disney's best due to how memorable they are. The songwriters who also worked the musical ""The Book of Mormon"" have easily produced some of Disney's best songs in years. They might be up there with the songs written by Alan Menken. As far as flaws, the film could have been a lot funnier. I remember laughing a lot during ""Tangled"", but not a lot during this. Don't get me wrong, it had some good laughs, but I feel there could have been more. Also, some of the song numbers could be cut out. There was this one number where I kept thinking to myself ""what was the point of this?"" However, there are just nitpicks.""Frozen"" is really a lot of fun with a really good story, breathtaking animation, funny characters, and songs that I can easily consider them an ear worm. I feel that Disney is really starting to come back and is capturing the magic they had back in the 90's. I hope they can continue to do so because if there's something that this movie proves, it's that Disney is still the best animation studio in the world.","['animation', 'studio', 'studio', 'make',

1119,7,"At first, I heard that this movie has been rated the number one Disney film of all time. After watching the movie, I thought that it is very over-rated. I felt that the movie was very incomplete and pretty much lame.However, I realized that this movie contains many strong messages and themes, and I have begun to appreciate it a lot more. I feel that the characters had a LOT of potential to develop more. There was lots of potential to add to the story line - there could have been so much more. The movie might as well have been an hour longer, so that it could incorporate a lot more ideas. I feel that the characters were left pretty incomplete, and that a lot was not revealed. However, the movie is wonderful in that it has strong, lead females. For once, a Disney movie contains strong princesses who have power and strength. Additionally, the ""true love"" is not a typical spark of lust. Rather, it is a much more beautiful and stronger bond - the bond of two sisters. Finally, ""true love"" and a true love's ""touch"" is something powerful that happens between sisters, and not between a random 'male and female'. Breaking out of the typical waste of time that has been going on for centuries in stories made this a very refreshing and wonderful movie.*7.5/10*","['first', 'heard', 'movie', 'rat', 'number', 'one', 'disney', 'film', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'thought', 'rat', 'felt', 'movie', 'incomplete', 'pretty', 'much', 'lame', 'however', 'realize', 'movie', 'contains', 'many', 'strong', 'message', 'theme', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'lot', 'feel', 'character', 'lot', 'potential', 'develop', 'lot', 'potential', 'add', 'story', 'line', 'could', 'much', 'movie', 'might', 'well', 'hour', 'longer', 'could', 'incorporate', 'lot', 'idea', 'feel', 'character', 'left', 'pretty', 'incomplete', 'lot', 'reveal', 'however', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'strong', 'lead', 'female', 'disney', 'movie', 'contains', 'strong', 'princess', 'power', 'strength', 'additionally', 'true', 'love', 'typical', 'spark', 'lust', 'rather', 'much', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'bond', 'bond', 'two', 'sister', 'finally', 'true', 'love', 'true', 'love', 'touch', 'something', 'powerful', 'happens', 'sister', 'random', 'male', 'female', 'break', 'typical', 'waste', 'time', 'go', 'century', 'story', 'make', 'refresh', 'wonderful', 'movie']","[36, 357, 1, 1055, 184, 10, 2, 3, 20, 23, 1, 92, 1055, 155, 1, 3942, 136, 31, 1344, 110, 428, 1, 1054, 61, 167, 185, 226, 160, 699, 84, 53, 8, 84, 685, 917, 84, 685, 269, 12, 213, 54, 31, 1, 252, 18, 487, 612, 54, 1750, 84, 281, 53, 8, 330, 136, 3942, 84, 528, 110, 1, 215, 167, 248, 237, 2, 1, 1054, 167, 29, 24, 887, 3207, 62, 6, 376, 2699, 3282, 191, 31, 93, 167, 482, 482, 42, 15, 241, 62, 6, 62, 6, 260, 89, 439, 591, 15, 1180, 431, 237, 340, 376, 644, 20, 13, 1248, 12, 14, 1010, 215, 1]"
1120,3,"I didn't initially want to see 'Frozen', but then I saw that it was from the creators of 'Tangled', a Disney movie which I enjoyed, so I thought I'd give it a chance. Now, I'm not a huge fan of musicals, and I know that when it comes to Disney animations, aside from Pixar, most are musicals. And I realize that 'Tangled' is, along with others of my favorites, so I've learned to just enjoy musicals. So I went into the theater with a clear mind and all doubts aside, and for the most part, I did enjoy it. But only because it made me laugh at some parts, and some of the songs were good.Now, what I didn't like so much was that it had too many conveniences in it. Now what I mean by that is that it had too many ""well that worked out nicely for everyone"" moments. The first being that Anna saved herself by saving her sister. So in a Disney movie, you know that a main character, usually, is not going to die at the end. I know some characters have died in the beginning of Disney movies for the sake of the story. But not many die during the end sequence. But the fact that Anna froze to save her sister, which ended up being her act of true love to save herself, worked out too nicely for me. I just feel like Disney could've done it better.Another kind of convenience that I didn't like was that when summer was brought back, Elsa placed a little flurry cloud over Olaf and only Olaf. Now she can suddenly limit her powers to put one cloud over Olaf and not accidentally cause a blizzard? And sure, she figured out that love is what she needs to contain her powers, which is kind of cheesy. But, everyone got their summer that they wanted AND Olaf got a snow cloud over him so that Disney didn't have to melt everyone's favorite character.And let's be honest, the movie was cute, but Olaf did kind of make the movie. You don't hear people come out of the theater talking about how cute the trolls were or how good Elsa's singing was. They come out telling all their friends how funny the little snowman was; and of all the lines in the movie, everybody's quoting Olaf. I don't think I would've liked it as much as I did if Olaf wasn't in it. Him and that guy at the trading post. ""Yoohoo! Big summer blowout."" That guy was awesome.So, the last thing I didn't like about 'Frozen' was that I saw too much of 'Tangled' in it. I know, I know, it was made from the same creators, so I know it's going to kind of look the same. But in too many of the characters and story aspects I saw 'Tangled'. First, a girl is born into royalty with magical elemental powers. I know Elsa didn't get kidnapped, but other than that, I see Rapunzel's origin. Another thing that I saw was the seclusion of the main character for their protection. So I see a kind of lack of difference between the two, besides what power they have, their desires and dreams in life, and that Elsa has a sister and Rapunzel doesn't.Another similarity between the two movies that I saw was the team that goes on the main journey who we follow throughout the story. You have your girl, Anna and Rapunzel, your guy, Kristoff and Flynn Rider, an animal, Sven and Maximus, and the sidekick, Olaf and Pascal. Also, in both films, the guy and girl of the group don't get along at first but gradually grow closer until they fall in love at the end. But I guess that happens in other films too.Lastly, the villain is someone who the girl loves and trusts and is close to until they discover the truth. Mother Gothel is the kidnapper who poses as Rapunzel's mother and Hans is Anna's true love and fiancé. And both girls, in a way, get their hearts broken in the end.Now for the things I did like about the movie. Like I've already mentioned, I did think Olaf was funny. Was he hilarious? No. But I did like the subtle humor he brought to the movie. I liked the overall humor of the movie as well, and found myself laughing at the small things, but other than Olaf, I don't feel that the other characters compared to those in 'Tangled'. I also very much enjoyed the music; score and soundtrack. I think that the stand out songs were, obviously, ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman?"", ""Let It Go"", and ""For The First Time In Forever"". One thing I noticed about the music was that it didn't really have a base genre. Each song sounded different than the last, although, I did hear the music of other songs hidden within each other. What I mean by base genre is a similar sound throughout the movie, such as Elton John in 'The Lion King' and Phil Collins in 'Tarzan'. But that lack of one distinctive sound didn't really bother me.And the last thing I liked about the movie was the animation. Since it was made by the creators of 'Tangled', and I liked that animation, I did like 'Frozen' too. I thought the snow looked great for computer animation.So, I did point out a lot of things that I didn't appreciate in the movie, but overall I thought it was enjoyable; because it is still Disney. Do I think it should be praised like it is? No. Do I think it is one of Disney's bests? No, because they make a bunch of great movies that I still like better than 'Frozen'. But any 'Tangled' fan will enjoy 'Frozen'.","['initially', 'want', 'see', 'frozen', 'saw', 'creator', 'tangle', 'disney', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'thought', 'give', 'chance', 'huge', 'fan', 'musical',

1121,6,"Oh look, a Disney animated musical. Haven't seen one of these in a while. And no, believe it or not for a change... I AIN'T being sarcastic.Recent films from the company eschew traditional formula, and concentrate more on exotic settings and independent female protagonists. (Strange how so many of them are princesses, you'd think they were trying to add to an existing line of merchandise) A couple of standard tropes remain though: One is that the heroine(s) must either start out with just one parent, or lose one or both quickly at the beginning. The other, far more grating, it the traditional 'comic relief'. Here, the position is filled by a buck-toothed animate snowman who keeps falling apart. I must say, I found this guy's clowning around about as appealing as a maggot sandwich. Why couldn't THIS be the snowman who melted at the end of Raymond Briggs's famous short film, rather than the far more lovable creation who did?As it is a musical, we get a ton and a half of tunes, all of which move the plot forward and do a good job of it, too. They are pleasant on the ear, with some amusing lyrics... but I can't imagine listening to any in isolation to the movie. The definite exception is the tremendous central song... 'Let It Go'. This is one of the best Disney songs in years, and the scene that accompanies it is easily the highlight of the film. It has been nominated for an Academy Award, and I hope it wins.The CGI is absolutely stunning, with the ice and snow so realistically rendered you'll shiver in your seat just by watching it. Either that, or you need to turn your heating up... you tightwad. As for the story, it has strong feminist trappings... which isn't a bad thing. The Queen doesn't need a husband to rule, and the personality-less 'hunk' her sister initially falls in love with turns out to be a class A cad. When she agreed to marry him the same day they met, I heard myself cry a very audible ""WHAT?!"". Fortunately, she soon sees the error of her ways, and takes a fancy to a less 'perfect' but more well rounded peasant instead. So, that's alright then.When I compare this to the last two Disney films, The Princess And The Frog and Tangled (also about princesses... you see my point?) it does come up short. Perhaps the main plot, about sister solidarity, was not all that interesting to me, and the lack of a major villain (apart from right near the end) did make proceedings slightly tepid. Plus, there was always that damn snowman, always lurking in the background. Someone pass me a giant microwave already.Don't get me wrong, it's still a lot of fun.

1122,7,"After an incredibly slow first act and some below par and childishly written songs, Frozen actually finally takes off and left me pretty pleased by the finale.What worked best here the original take on the age-old Disney Princess animated feature. There was no grandiose villain, the conflicts were real and the love did show despite what I had thought the characters should've/would've done. Oh, and the stereotypical sidekick goofball character Disney loves to throw in wasn't exactly an original idea, but thanks to incredibly hilarious writing and ideas, I loved almost every minute the tiny snowman, Olaf, was on screen.Unfortunately, the movie was all ice capades for me. Despite the very long and sluggish start, my biggest problem was the music. For the majority, but one song – and that one, Let It Go, was just okay in the movie, the lyrics were so elementary and quietly frankly, unpleasant to my ears. These songs along with Olaf might have been there to please the younger audience, but not one soared to my expectations from these Disney Princess animated films.Luckily, it's easy to get past the songs since the majority of them are in the first half and it's the second half of the film that makes this movie ascend.After an accident involving a Princess's unexplained power to manipulate ice and cold, the King and Queen separates their two daughters from each other and the world for many years. Unrealistically, but then, this is a fantasy tale, the powerless Princess of the two clings to hope that she can be best friends again after many years of isolation and intentional avoidance.Once the years of seclusion are over, hell literally freezes over by the unresolved issues from the ice Queen. Will her sister save her from herself and the kingdom? Will they all thaw out? Will it ever be explained how some have powers, some bodies can break apart and others can rock and roll?Stick with the tale and it will, ah-hem, warm your heart by the ending. Not the best Disney/non-Pixar film in years – Tangled was much better, but still worth a watch. Just, bring a sweater.* * * Final thoughts: It was nice for Disney to go back to its roots in their classic format, but it was even better that they shook the story up and modernized their filmmaking. This was a smart, and definitely profitable, move to keep up with the other studios. I don't always praise Disney, but they did right here for the most part.","['incredibly', 'slow', 'first', 'act', 'par', 'childishly', 'write', 'song', 'frozen', 'actually', 'finally', 'take', 'left', 'pretty', 'pleased', 'finale', 'work', 'best', 'original', 'take', 'age', 'old', 'disney', 'princess', 'animate', 'feature', 'grandiose', 'villain', 'conflict', 'real', 'love', 'show', 'despite', 'thought', 'character', 'would', 'oh', 'stereotypical', 'sidekick', 'goofball', 'character', 'disney', 'love', 'throw', 'exactly', 'original', 'idea', 'thanks', 'incredibly', 'hilarious', 'write', 'idea', 'love', 'almost', 'every', 'minute', 'tiny', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'ice', 'capades', 'despite', 'long', 'sluggish', 'start', 'big', 'problem', 'music', 'majority', 'one', 'song', 'one', 'let', 'go', 'okay', 'movie', 'lyric', 'elementary', 'quietly', 'frankly', 'unpleasant', 'ear', 'song', 'along', 'olaf', 'might', 'please', 'young', 'audience', 'one', 'soar', 'expectation', 'disney', 'princess', 'animate', 'film', 'luckily', 'easy', 'get', 'past', 'song', 'since', 'majority', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'make', 'movie', 'ascend', 'accident', 'involve', 'princess', 'unexplained', 'power', 'manipulate', 'ice', 'cold', 'king', 'queen', 'separate', 'two', 'daughter', 'world', 'many', 'year', 'unrealistically', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'powerless', 'princess', 'two', 'cling', 'hope', 'best', 'friend', 'many', 'year', 'isolation', 'intentional', 'avoidance', 'year', 'seclusion', 'hell', 'literally', 'freeze', 'unresolved', 'issue', 'ice', 'queen', 'sister', 'save', 'kingdom', 'thaw', 'ever', 'explain', 'power', 'body', 'break', 'apart', 'others', 'rock', 'roll', 'stick', 'tale', 'ah', 'hem', 'warm', 'heart', 'end', 'best', 'disney', 'non', 'pixar', 'film', 'year', 'tangle', 'much', 'well', 'still', 'worth', 'watch', 'bring', 'sweater', 'final', 'thought', 'nice', 'disney', 'go', 'back', 'root', 'classic', 'format', 'even', 'well', 'shook', 'story', 'modernize', 'filmmaking', 'smart', 'definitely', 'profitable', 'move', 'keep', 'studio', 'always', 'praise', 'disney', 'right', 'part']","[603, 1065, 36, 112, 1028, 165, 11, 5, 103, 241, 55, 330, 136, 1515, 3977, 107, 34, 230, 55, 139, 64, 2, 29, 38, 229, 104, 552, 195, 6, 78, 313, 92, 8, 26, 425, 1567, 436, 8, 2, 6, 744, 522, 230, 281, 1182, 603, 364, 165, 281, 6, 173, 115, 211, 1936, 45, 32, 369, 573, 1, 33, 313, 169, 120, 106, 198, 58, 1163, 10, 11, 10, 30, 13, 420, 1, 475, 5249, 4962, 1547, 3940, 939, 11, 172, 32, 252, 576, 73, 159, 10, 3189, 452, 2, 29, 38, 3, 3419, 454, 19, 276, 11, 98, 1163, 36, 346, 319, 346, 3, 14, 1, 5000, 480, 584, 29, 1401, 24, 1343, 33, 366, 97, 49, 786, 42, 389, 126, 61, 47, 3001, 545, 114, 29, 42, 384, 34, 327, 61, 47, 600, 47, 2804, 778, 643, 282, 5177, 519, 33, 49, 15, 111, 77, 775, 81, 400, 24, 1220, 340, 512, 247, 834, 985, 1553, 114, 2257, 362, 80, 41, 34, 2, 1085, 194, 3, 47, 83, 31, 18, 68, 254, 23, 221, 5043, 817, 92, 192, 2, 13, 74, 885, 69, 1778, 28, 18, 12, 3688, 3671, 1001, 174, 242, 154, 311, 163, 535, 2, 130, 94]"
1123,9,"I use to love one and only Little Mermaid (1989) back when I was a kid. Others Disney did not hit me at all until came Frozen.However, I was looking forward to more part of Elsa tho. The important part of the whole movie, is to listen properly specially the singing. It contains some interesting dialog. The graphics is all well done but 1 part I would like to mention is the stairway that Elsa make during the song ""Let It Go"". The stair could have done more better curves instead of being stiff. Since the part where she start singing the chorus the snowflakes were elegant and fine curves, same as she blows the snows but when come to the stair is a bit off didn't show much curve and elegant in it. By the way, I love the song ""Do You Wanna Build A Snowman"" and ""Let It Go"". The scores are great including the ""Epilogue"" very cultural music. This would recommend for family entertainment. Another part of the movie that I like is the story line got twisted. Prince Hans wasn't really what other Prince charming is.The next thing about this movie is the Lesson within it. It really tells that ""True Love"" does not have to be a man but through sister's love. Overall, still very worth to watch this movie.","['use', 'love', 'one', 'little', 'mermaid', 'back', 'kid', 'others', 'disney', 'hit', 'come', 'frozen', 'however', 'look', 'forward', 'part', 'elsa', 'tho', 'important', 'part', 'whole', 'movie', 'listen', 'properly', 'specially', 'sing', 'contains', 'interest', 'dialog', 'graphic', 'well', 'part', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'stairway', 'elsa', 'make', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'stair', 'could', 'well', 'curve', 'instead', 'stiff', 'since', 'part', 'start', 'sing', 'chorus', 'snowflake', 'elegant', 'fine', 'curve', 'blow', 'snow', 'come', 'stair', 'bit', 'show', 'much', 'curve', 'elegant', 'way', 'love', 'song', 'wan', 'build', 'snowman', 'let', 'go', 'score', 'great', 'include', 'epilogue', 'cultural', 'music', 'would', 'recommend', 'family', 'entertainment', 'another', 'part', 'movie', 'like', 'story', 'line', 'get', 'twist', 'prince', 'han', 'really', 'prince', 'charm', 'next', 'thing', 'movie', 'lesson', 'within', 'really', 'tell', 'true', 'love', 'man', 'sister', 'love', 'overall', 'still', 'worth', 'watch', 'movie']","[158, 6, 10, 48, 422, 74, 60, 247, 2, 234, 40, 5, 110, 66, 571, 94, 4, 3280, 289, 94, 127, 1, 531, 1675, 3336, 63, 1054, 122, 1187, 714, 18, 94, 26, 9, 348, 4, 14, 11, 30, 13, 5254, 54, 18, 3316, 208, 98, 94, 120, 63, 2087, 1112, 2471, 470, 3316, 1255, 39, 40, 5254, 95, 78, 31, 3316, 2471, 50, 6, 11, 779, 202, 45, 30, 13, 223, 25, 349, 1597, 58, 26, 262, 72, 839, 102, 94, 1, 9, 12, 213, 19, 129, 82, 44, 22, 82, 235, 418, 43, 1, 499, 654, 22, 143, 62, 6, 145, 15, 6, 166, 68, 254, 23, 1]"
1124,9,"Frozen is a new Disney film staring Kristen Bell, Jonathan Groff, and Josh Gad. Oddly enough, I hadn't really seen any advertising done for the film. So it was kind of nice going into it with no real knowledge or expectations. After quite a few previews, and as many amc adds....why advertise the theater I am already in? After all that, the movie began, except not. You are treated to a Mickey Mouse short that frankly could have been removed and I would have been happier. I am not sure if it was included due to Pixar usually doing something, but it fell flat and started the movie off with me annoyed. This brings me to another point, the sound. The sound was awful at the theater I saw it at. The Universal Studios theater. It sounded all filtered and distorted. I know this is not the movies fault, so I will not hold it against it. But since it was a movie with lots of singing, understand that is why I don't really spend much time on that section.The story, with minor spoilers, is that Anna and Elise are princesses of some land with a name I don't remember. They are very close as children, but over the course of a musical number we see that all change. Elise has magic powers that allow her to create and control ice and snow. Afraid of her hurting her sister with her powers, the parents decide to seal off the children from the world. They raise them separately and they no longer interact with each other. The main story kicks in when they are older and Elise is becoming queen. After finally seeing her sister again, Anna gets carried away and angers her. Elise looses control of her powers and sends their kingdom into an eternal winter. Voice acting is very different from regular acting. It requires different talents and skills. I don't recall Kristen Bell doing voice work before, so it was very nice to see she took naturally to it. From what I could tell, she also did well with the singing portions. Her character Anna was the main role in the movie, and Bell was fantastic. The person who surprised me though was Josh Gad. I had no clue who he was going into the film, but his role as Olef the snowman was a show stealer. He does a musical number about how he wants to see summer, so he can finally do whatever it is snow does when it gets hot. Between his dopey but lovable demeanor, he easily had some of the more humorous and memorable parts. Groff also did well, but other then one musical portion, his character really doesn't stand out much. Sound...yeah. Music sounded like it was all well done, and a few of the numbers were very clever. Nothing really stood out as just being bad from what I could tell. Oh if you see it with your family or friends, make sure to ask them who voices the reindeer with a serious face. Don't worry, you will know when the time is right to ask.Animation was pretty good in this one. It was done in a similar style as Tangeled or Brave. The people looked rather realistic, but the faces are often done in a more exaggerated manor. It seems like it allows for a wider range of emotions, but that could also be just in my head. The snow was cool though, and the magic stuff was impressive to see. You expect a certain level from a big Disney animated film, and this one easily met it. Seeing Elise manipulate her surroundings was always enjoyable.The story overall was decent. Seeing the sisters trying to deal with their issues was a nice change of pace. While it wouldn't be a Disney movie without a romance subplot, this one felt unique enough to stand out. It never takes the main stage, and it didn't feel forced. The sound was hard to gauge, but I think everything was good with it. And the voice work was animated and enjoyable. Great animation quality, and cool magical visuals to round everything up. Honestly I enjoyed this movie more then I thought I would. It is a great date night movie if your lady is into these kind of films. And a great family movie that I think both male and female kids would enjoy. Hell, I can even say as a almost 30 year old male that I enjoyed the musical princess film.4 out of 5 stars.","['frozen', 'new', 'disney', 'film', 'star', 'kristen', 'bell', 'jonathan', 'groff',

1125,8,"Disney is always known for and loved as a studio with its animated musicals for the whole audience, something for both the kids and adults. Last year, Disney expanded by not doing a musical with Wreck-It Ralph. Now, Disney is back with Frozen, a musical that fits in with Disney classics.The film starts off with Anna and Elsa, two princesses who live in their parents' kingdom. Elsa has the ability to make Winter weather at any time, to which she and her sister have fun with it until her power accidentally hits Anna in the head and knocks her out. As Elsa's power grows stronger, she locks herself away from everyone, including her sister. When the time for her to be named queen, Elsa is afraid of what everyone will see, but keeps herself calm until Anna announces her engagement to Prince Hans, who she has just met. This causes an outrage in Elsa, who walks away in rage, but not without Anna giving her the third degree as to why. Elsa leaves for the North Mountain, and unintentionally causes an eternal winter in her home of Arendelle. When she makes it, she realizes that it's okay to not be afraid of her powers, and builds herself an ice palace (played over with the brilliant number ""Let It Go""). Anna now makes it her mission to find her sister and bring back Summer. On the way, she enlists the help of an ice trader named Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and an eccentric snowman named Olaf.The cast all does a good job and worked their voices into their characters. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel do some very nice work as the two princesses, Anna and Elsa. They both do nice of making their characters as great counterparts to one another and pull off their roles as sisters. Jonathan Groff is entertaining as Kristoff, the ice salesman who joins in Anna's quest to bring summer back. Alan Tudyk, who did some excellent work in last year's Disney film, Wreck-It Ralph, is hilarious in his minimal role here as the Duke of Weselton. The real stand out in this film is Josh Gad of Book of Mormon fame as Olaf the snowman. Gad does some brilliant work of making Olaf the comic relief who is always keeping positive and never in the way.The story is loosely based off of Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" and the directors do a nice job of making their own thing, like many Disney movies before it. The animation is nicely done and has some great visuals and shot sequences. In addition to that is a brilliant score by Christophe Beck and some great songs that made for memorable musical numbers, some funny and some serious. ""Let It Go"" is the best of all the musical numbers.","['disney', 'always', 'know', 'love', 'studio', 'animate', 'musical', 'whole', 'audience', 'something', 'kid', 'adult', 'last', 'year', 'disney', 'expand', 'musical', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'disney', 'back', 'frozen', 'musical', 'fit', 'disney', 'classic', 'film', 'start', 'anna', 'elsa', 'two', 'princess', 'live', 'parent', 'kingdom', 'elsa', 'ability', 'make', 'winter', 'weather', 'time', 'sister', 'fun', 'power', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'anna', 'head', 'knock', 'elsa', 'power', 'grows', 'strong', 'lock', 'away', 'everyone', 'include', 'sister', 'time', 'name', 'queen', 'elsa', 'afraid', 'everyone', 'see', 'keep', 'calm', 'anna', 'announces', 'engagement', 'prince', 'han', 'met', 'cause', 'outrage', 'elsa', 'walk', 'away', 'rage', 'without', 'anna', 'give', 'third', 'degree', 'elsa', 'leaf', 'north', 'mountain', 'unintentionally', 'cause', 'eternal', 'winter', 'home', 'arendelle', 'make', 'realizes', 'okay', 'afraid', 'power', 'build', 'ice', 'palace', 'played', 'brilliant', 'number', 'let', 'go', 'anna', 'make', 'mission', 'find', 'sister', 'bring', 'back', 'summer', 'way', 'enlists', 'help', 'ice', 'trader', 'name', 'kristoff', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'eccentric', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'work', 'voice', 'character', 'kristen', 'bell', 'idina', 'menzel', 'nice', 'work', 'two', 'princess', 'anna', 'elsa', 'nice', 'make', 'character', 'great', 'counterpart', 'one', 'another', 'pull', 'role', 'sister', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'entertain', 'kristoff', 'ice', 'salesman', 'join', 'anna', 'quest', 'bring', 'summer', 'back', 'alan', 'tudyk', 'excellent', 'work', 'last', 'year', 'disney', 'film', 'wreck', 'ralph', 'hilarious', 'minimal', 'role', 'duke', 'weselton', 'real', 'stand', 'film', 'josh', 'gad', 'book', 'mormon', 'fame', 'olaf', 'snowman', 'gad', 'brilliant', 'work', 'make', 'olaf', 'comic', 'relief', 'always', 'keep', 'positive', 'never', 'way', 'story', 'loosely', 'base', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'snow', 'queen', 'director', 'nice', 'job', 'make', 'thing', 'like', 'many', 'disney', 'movie', 'animation', 'nicely', 'great', 'visuals', 'shot', 'sequence', 'addition', 'brilliant', 'score', 'christophe', 'beck', 'great', 'song', 'make', 'memorable', 'musical', 'number', 'funny', 'serious', 'let', 'go', 'best', 'musical', 'number']","[2, 163, 56, 6, 311, 38, 51, 127, 159, 89, 60, 147, 197, 47, 2, 2506, 51, 352, 379, 2, 74, 5, 51, 560, 2, 69, 3, 120, 7, 4, 42, 29, 224, 118, 77, 4, 367, 14, 105, 986, 20, 15, 125, 24, 300, 234, 7, 317, 1138, 4, 24, 1291, 167, 382, 101, 109, 349, 15, 20, 183, 49, 4, 558, 109, 16, 154, 3007, 7, 2462, 1965, 82, 44, 392, 328, 3086, 4, 669, 101, 2069, 137, 7, 57, 715, 1561, 4, 586, 1252, 214, 2029, 328, 310, 105, 533, 199, 14, 1571, 420, 558, 24, 202, 33, 383, 507, 523, 184, 30, 13, 7, 14, 3674, 71, 15, 221, 74, 205, 50, 3815, 135, 33, 1756, 183, 67, 151, 181, 2815, 45, 183, 32, 227, 17, 373, 107, 86, 8, 162, 146, 141, 116, 192, 107, 42, 29, 7, 4, 192, 14, 8, 25, 3069, 10, 102, 695, 371, 15, 455, 377, 243, 67, 33, 1443, 813, 7, 1527, 221, 205, 74, 1134, 1426, 298, 107, 197, 47, 2, 3, 352, 379, 364, 1939, 371, 762, 1233, 195, 361, 3, 275, 257, 596, 1636, 2287, 32, 45, 257, 523, 107, 14, 32, 309, 297, 163, 154, 503, 88, 50, 12, 696, 256, 44, 245, 339, 39, 49, 770, 192, 373, 14, 43, 9, 61, 2, 1, 21, 1231, 25, 267, 1103, 502, 1000, 523, 223, 1357, 1307, 25, 11, 14, 268, 51, 184, 85, 835, 30, 13, 34, 51, 184]"

It seems they have watched the wrong movie- as the love story was hers- it just did not involve a guy.","['saw', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'first', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'see', 'lot', 'disney', 'movie', 'recently', 'may', 'behind', 'time', 'like', 'one', 'poked', 'fun', 'pretty', 'much', 'every', 'disney', 'animation', 'see', 'point', 'ridiculousness', 'true', 'love', 'even', 'dance', 'sing', 'together', 'even', 'short', 'harrow', 'trust', 'building', 'journey', 'also', 'like', 'comic', 'relief', 'snowman', 'kept', 'minimum', 'actually', 'serve', 'purpose', 'film', 'review', 'write', 'elsa', 'main', 'character', 'love', 'story', 'seem', 'watch', 'wrong', 'movie', 'love', 'story', 'involve', 'guy']","[157, 47, 64, 389, 36, 1, 106, 369, 16, 84, 2, 1, 1253, 171, 750, 20, 9, 10, 125, 136, 31, 115, 2, 21, 16, 117, 4180, 62, 6, 28, 1067, 63, 332, 28, 263, 836, 920, 337, 27, 9, 309, 297, 45, 498, 3846, 103, 1173, 646, 3, 161, 165, 4, 119, 8, 6, 12, 75, 23, 280, 1, 6, 12, 584, 148]"
1127,7,"Well, I got a chance to see Disney's ""Frozen,"" and I must say, it's pretty cute, but the story did not provide enough details to the lesson(s) that can be learned between Elsa and Anna. The only problem with the story is that it pays too much attention expressing emotions between Elsa and Anna, plus the characters show off with sing-a-longs and a few gags just to bring laughter and joy. However, the animation is overall tremendous and the 3D effects are amazing. And as for the songs, none of them kept on pace with the story. Most of the songs show off, except 1½ of the songs such as ""For the First Time since Forever (1)"" and ""Let It Go (½)."" Even though the movie does show some lessons to learn, but it was not descriptive enough to support the lessons.The story did not live up to its momentum. It only expressed emotions between two sisters Elsa and Anna. Plus, there's a bit of a slip up. In the scene ""The Party is Over, Close the Gates,"" Elsa should've used her other hand with her GLOVE on, instead of her bare hand which revealed her icy powers. This slip up proves that the story pays too much attention to the emotions. When you look at the whole story, you can almost see a retelling of Disney and Pixar's ""Brave"" based on character references, besides the story.Speaking of the betrayal of Prince Hans, there are twists in the story. What is twisted about the betrayal of Prince Hans is that prince charming was supposed to save the princess, but instead betrayed the princess for her kingdom. Another twist is Anna choosing between Kristoff, since they love each other, and her sister Elsa who was about to be killed by Prince Hans with his sword. She chose her sister since she truly loved her.The animation has a lot of snowflake effects, especially when you can see a floating snowflake in 3D. You can almost capture it and see it melt upon your hand, but noticed that it's all 3D and not real. Disney is an expert on creating real 3D effects to make it look real. The icy power strongly reflected Elsa's emotions, but did not comply with the story. But for the record, the animation on her icy powers was fascinating, especially for self defense against the Duke of Weselton's bodyguards.The characters in the story truly kept on pace with the story, but sometimes show off from each of their point of views. Of course, there's one character who truly supported Elsa and Anna, and that is Olaf the snowman. Despite his purpose to spend time with summer in his song ""In Summer,"" not only he gives warm hugs to people, but also gives hope to keep them going. Some minor characters, such as the Duke of Weselton and trader named Oaken, almost even the odds but provided small gags. The main antagonist, Prince Hans, brought the twist at the last half of the movie. He provided the climax for the story. The Abominable Marshmallow was Elsa's snow guardian. The king and queen in the story were quite short, but did provide a bit of drama in the beginning. The trolls played an important role in the story since they help restore people from any kind of danger. But throughout, the trolls mostly helped Anna since she's the only person who got help by the trolls (except Kristoff kind of raised by the trolls). The main characters in the story are Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf. Elsa is almost the main protagonist in the story since she possessed the icy powers within her, but the real main protagonist was Anna since it is up to her to bring Elsa back to her kingdom and bring summer back as well. Kristoff, with his reindeer Sven, not only saved Anna from a pack of wolves after they left Oaken's place, but more importantly brought her to the trolls after she got a frozen heart. Speaking of Sven, he reminds me of Maximus from Disney's ""Rapunzel (Tangled),"" since it acts like a dog than an actual deer. Olaf is a supporter to Elsa and Anna. He helped Anna escape from the library to get to Kristoff and Elsa.When characters sing their songs, most of them show off, but Elsa and Anna provided an important song, ""For the First Time since Forever,"" and a bit of Elsa's song, ""Let It Go."" The song, ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman,"" almost stayed close to the story based on the age shift from young to adult on Elsa and Anna, but more on a relationship between sisters after Elsa was forced to conceal her icy spell from Anna's sight after her accident when she was young. However, the last part of the song was a bit sad after their parents' death at sea. Most songs are showing off.The movie does show lessons, such as love conquers fear, give more time to know each other before acceptance of marriage or other, and ALMOST controlling fear. If the trolls give Elsa training to control her fear (despite her icy powers growing), then she would succeed and overcome fear. But the movie didn't quite provide enough details to represent the lessons that can be learned. They are only partial lessons just to keep the story going. Again, the story didn't live up to its momentum. It strongly reflected Elsa and Anna's emotions than providing details that represent their emotions. But for the record, it will be entertaining for children and their parents everywhere.Grade: C+","['well', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'disney', 'frozen', 'must', 'say', 'pretty', 'cute', 'story',

1128,-,"I was born in 1994, so I was just in time for the incredible string of animated Disney movies that were going to teach the generation just as many lessons as their teachers in school. I learned about the strangers like me with Tarzan and I helped Captain Shang make a man out of Mulan. I had friend in Woody and Buzz and I found Nemo at 42 Wallaby Way. I watched Simba learn the ways of Hukana Matata and I helped Pacha get Kuzco turned back into a human. I saw Milo Thatch find the lost city of Atlantis and I saved Stitch from Jumba and Pleakley. Now with their latest box office hit Frozen, I am very happy to say that let it go with Queen Elsa and I definitely wanted to build a snowman with Princess Anna. Whoever's idea it was to cast Broadway star Idina Menzel deserves a raise and a promotion. Menzel was best known for her roles as Maureen Johnson in the hit Broadway musical Rent, for which she received a Tony Award nomination, and the role of Elphaba in the blockbuster Broadway musical Wicked, for which she received the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. However, if you walk the streets now and ask people where they have heard the name Idina Menzel, don't be shocked if they say Elsa from Frozen.Princess Elsa was born with the magical power to control snow and ice. After a childhood accident, the King and Queen decide it is best to keep her cut off from the world, including her younger sister Anna, so nobody can discover her powers. For 21 years Elsa' gift is kept a secret, then on her coronation day she loses her temper and her powers are reveled, forcing her to run from her kingdom of Arendelle, freezing the entire kingdom in the process, and once again lock herself away from the outside world. While climbing through the blizzard that she has created, she comes to the conclusion that she can no longer keep her power bottled up inside her, so she decides to let it go; which we see done through one of Frozen's hit songs ""Let It Go"", Menzel shows off her singing powers and they do not disappoint. One of the best characteristics a Disney movie can have is having one or two songs that can get stuck in the head of someone of every age group, and Menzel does just that with this instant Disney classic. It is that odd for different people to hear different messages from the same song, however in ""Let It Go"" the message seems to be a rather clear one and it is this. You can't let the things that make you different from others keep you from living your life the way that you want to live it. Weather it is a disability you were born with or a secret that you have been hiding your entire life, you have to move past it and enjoy what you have. The other main character we so greatly enjoyed in Frozen is Queen Elsa's sister, Princess Anna, played by Kristen Bell. We see her grow up without really knowing her sister, and having to make her fun. We get to view this through the other hit song featured in Frozen, ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?"" Most of us have siblings that we were really good friends with and would do everything with, then they would get older and find other interests, often times leaving the younger sibling behind to enjoy the memories of all the fun they had, so this song really hits home to those of us that know exactly what Anna is going through, and Bell does a great job of portraying the younger but just as lonely sister.When Elsa takes off, Anna feels like it is her responsibility to go and bring her back to Arendelle and undo the eternal winter that she accidentally created when in her weakened and emotional state. On her quest she makes the companionship of Kristoff the ice salesman voiced by Jonathan Groff and his reindeer Sven along with Olaf the talking snowman who has always wanted to experience summer (this is a Disney movie after all) voiced by Josh Gad. These two unlikely companions help Anna bring Elsa back while at the same time and without knowing it, teach her the true meaning of true love. So, like the majority of the Disney movies, the lessons Frozen teach those who watch it is all about love. Love is the only thing that can truly make a person change the way they live, revealed to us by a group of singing trolls. Love has the power to warm even the coldest heart and it teaches us to take matters of the heart slow. How well do you really know the person you claim you love and loves you back, it makes us realize that it takes longer than one night's worth of talking to find your ""one true love""; it also teaches to protect our hearts, just because someone says that they love you it is not necessarily true.","['born', 'time', 'incredible', 'string', 'animate', 'disney', 'movie', 'go', 'teach', 'generation',

1129,10,"Cinderella and Snow White got the gold watches and a nice retirement party. The era of spunky, take-no-prisoners Disney heroines is upon us, and it is good. There are only so many ways to shuffle the elements of a fairy tale, and they've all been done, so if you're expecting anything radically new from any fairy tale, well, tough luck. That's the limitations of the genre, not the film.The film opens with a haunting chant that sounds more Polynesian or native American than anything else, then a striking scene of ice harvesters cutting ice in the winter. The only thing quite like it is the circus roustabouts in ""Dumbo"" erecting tents. Visually and musically, it's one of the best things in the film. I'd like to have seen more things in this style. We get introduced to Kristoff, the hero, as a youngster trying to keep up with the grown-ups.The kingdom of Arendelle has two princesses, Elsa and Anna. Elsa is cursed with the power of freezing things and becomes a recluse, until the day of her coronation, when she panics and locks the kingdom in perpetual winter, then flees into the mountains. It's up to Anna to rescue her. The film has the predictable musical numbers, but they're better integrated with the story than say, the tedious ""Mother knows best"" in ""Tangled,"" and more appealing. Still, I'd like to see a return to singable tunes that can really stand alone. ""The first time in forever"" is straight out of the ""I did it my way"" cocktail lounge genre.Visually, it's wonderful. Gorgeous scenery, Elsa's ice palace, cute trolls. There's plenty of humor and a plot twist where a seeming hero turns out to be a villain.","['cinderella', 'snow', 'white', 'get', 'gold', 'watch', 'nice', 'retirement', 'party', 'era', 'spunky', 'take', 'prisoner', 'disney', 'heroine', 'upon', 'u', 'good', 'many', 'way', 'shuffle', 'element', 'fairy', 'tale', 'expect', 'anything', 'radically', 'new', 'fairy', 'tale', 'well', 'tough', 'luck', 'limitation', 'genre', 'film', 'film', 'open', 'haunt', 'chant', 'sound', 'polynesian', 'native', 'american', 'anything', 'else', 'strike', 'scene', 'ice', 'harvester', 'cut', 'ice', 'winter', 'thing', 'quite', 'like', 'circus', 'roustabout', 'dumbo', 'erect', 'tent', 'visually', 'musically', 'one', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'like', 'see', 'thing', 'style', 'get', 'introduce', 'kristoff', 'hero', 'youngster', 'try', 'keep', 'grown', 'ups', 'kingdom', 'arendelle', 'two', 'princess', 'elsa', 'anna', 'elsa', 'curse', 'power', 'freeze', 'thing', 'becomes', 'recluse', 'day', 'coronation', 'panic', 'lock', 'kingdom', 'perpetual', 'winter', 'flees', 'mountain', 'anna', 'rescue', 'film', 'predictable', 'musical', 'number', 'well', 'integrate', 'story', 'say', 'tedious', 'mother', 'know', 'best', 'tangle', 'appeal', 'still', 'like', 'see', 'return', 'singable', 'tune', 'really', 'stand', 'alone', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'straight', 'way', 'cocktail', 'lounge', 'genre', 'visually', 'wonderful', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'elsa', 'ice', 'palace', 'cute', 'troll', 'plenty', 'humor', 'plot', 'twist', 'seem', 'hero', 'turn', 'villain']","[854, 39, 365, 19, 1920, 23, 192, 1123, 942, 1909, 55, 5224, 2, 565, 554, 177, 17, 61, 50, 401, 219, 114, 131, 212, 108, 219, 114, 18, 1771, 2333, 2493, 768, 3, 3, 318, 2665, 1971, 259, 3374, 1413, 212, 270, 1193, 90, 33, 2027, 723, 33, 105, 43, 124, 9, 4649, 2222, 585, 1769, 10, 34, 43, 3, 9, 16, 43, 355, 19, 736, 67, 544, 2347, 87, 154, 1107, 2078, 77, 199, 42, 29, 4, 7, 4, 405, 24, 282, 43, 380, 2588, 138, 343, 2868, 382, 77, 1437, 105, 710, 214, 7, 1518, 3, 331, 51, 184, 18, 3947, 12, 35, 3063, 883, 56, 34, 83, 484, 68, 9, 16, 385, 804, 22, 361, 344, 36, 20, 287, 984, 50, 768, 585, 215, 444, 1217, 4, 33, 383, 265, 123, 727, 222, 52, 129, 75, 544, 113, 104]"
1130,10,"Frozen is the brand new animated movie produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, the creators of some of the most enthralling animated movies of all time: The Lion King, Aladdin, Wreck-It-Ralph, Bolt...to name but a few.Princess Anna feels tired of constantly being shut out by her sister, Elsa (liitle does she know, that the reason for this, is because Elsa possesses magic snow powers which she cannot control). When Elsa's coronation spirals out of control, leaving the kingdom in eternal winter and forcing Elsa to flee, Anna sets out on a thrilling and chilling adventure to find her and bring her back home. Along the way, Anna encounters a lovable man called Kirstoff, Kridtoff's adorable reindeer, and a hilarious snowman called Olaf.A beautifully-animated, heart-warming movie, which can be enjoyed by both adults and children alike, Frozen is a truly enchanting masterpiece.

1131,10,"I didn't see any ads for Frozen and thought it was going to be another boring princess movie. The kind of predictable love story with some beautiful princess and okay animation. But I was so, so utterly wrong.This is by far the best movie I have seen in a long time, and I'm not a huge fan or kids movies or animated movies. But Frozen blew me away. I've seen it multiple times which is something I have never done for any movie and yet I still want to go see Frozen again! The animation was breathtaking, the scenes with the snow and ice were almost magical. The characters where well thought of and the humor was spot on.The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that Anna doesn't have a 'power'. The real love story here was the love of family, (which I applaud Disney for) but why didn't Anna find out she had some type of fire power or something to balance Elsa out and bring the two sisters closer? I mean it would make sense since Anna has reddish hair like fire, and Elsa has white hair like ice. I think that would have made this movie ever cooler.Other than that I am still in love with this movie and think the sound tack is even great!","['see', 'ad', 'frozen', 'thought', 'go', 'another', 'boring', 'princess', 'movie', 'kind', 'predictable', 'love', 'story', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'okay', 'animation', 'utterly', 'wrong', 'far', 'best', 'movie', 'see', 'long', 'time', 'huge', 'fan', 'kid', 'movie', 'animate', 'movie', 'frozen', 'blew', 'away', 'see', 'multiple', 'time', 'something', 'never', 'movie', 'yet', 'still', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'frozen', 'animation', 'breathtaking', 'scene', 'snow', 'ice', 'almost', 'magical', 'character', 'well', 'thought', 'humor', 'spot', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'anna', 'power', 'real', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'family', 'applaud', 'disney', 'anna', 'find', 'type', 'fire', 'power', 'something', 'balance', 'elsa', 'bring', 'two', 'sister', 'closer', 'mean', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'since', 'anna', 'reddish', 'hair', 'like', 'fire', 'elsa', 'white', 'hair', 'like', 'ice', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'ever', 'cooler', 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'think', 'sound', 'tack', 'even', 'great']","[16, 2463, 5, 92, 13, 102, 370, 29, 1, 193, 331, 6, 12, 93, 29, 420, 21, 1209, 280, 142, 34, 1, 16, 169, 20, 360, 176, 60, 1, 38, 1, 5, 2061, 101, 16, 1418, 20, 89, 88, 1, 182, 68, 59, 13, 16, 5, 21, 905, 90, 39, 33, 173, 170, 8, 18, 92, 222, 1278, 43, 476, 201, 7, 24, 195, 6, 12, 6, 72, 1235, 2, 7, 71, 524, 1706, 24, 89, 677, 4, 221, 42, 15, 2552, 218, 26, 14, 217, 98, 7, 844, 9, 1706, 4, 365, 844, 9, 33, 37, 26, 14, 1, 81, 4562, 68, 6, 1, 37, 259, 28, 25]"

1133,8,"I saw the preview trailer for this, where the snowman sneezed and lost his carrot nose, and the opposite side of a lake a reindeer skidding towards it. This was a teaser for the real Disney film, a reversioning of the story The Snow Queen by Hans Christian Anderson, and I was looking forward to it. Basically, in the Kingdom of Arendelle, the princess Elsa (Idina Menzel) has cryokinetic powers, which means she can summon ice and snow through her hands, she and her younger sister Anna (Kristen Bell) used to be very close as children, but she accidentally injured her younger sister while playing as children, so the King (Maurice LaMarche) and the Queen have the Grand Pabbie the Troll King (Ciarán Hinds) heal and erase the memory of Anna knowing that her sister has powers. As they have grown up they have drifted apart, with Elsa forced to wear gloves, as she has not learned to control her powers, and is afraid of harming other people, their parents die at sea, but Elsa being secluded in her room has created a rift between them, it is only at her coronation that the sisters are talking more. Anna is excited that the gates of the kingdom are opened, exploring she bumps into Prince Hans of the Southern Isles (Santino Fontana), they form a very quick mutual attraction, and at the coronation, which seems to go fine for Elsa without any incident removing her gloves, Hans proposes to Anna, but her sister will not give her blessing, and an argument between them exposes Elsa's powers to everyone. Elsa flees the kingdom and inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter over the kingdom, but alone she realises that she no longer has to be afraid and can embrace her powers, in celebration she builds herself an ice palace, and unknowingly brings to life a snowman that the sisters built as children, Olaf (Josh Gad), Anna meanwhile sets off on a journey to find her sister to bring her back, end the winter and reconcile. Getting supplies from a shack Anna meets mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven, she convinces him to guide her to the North Mountain to find her sister, and meeting Olaf on the journey he helps them to find the palace of ice, she tries to convince her sister to return, but she still fears hurting people, and agitated by her persisting Elsa strikes her sister with her power in the chest. Fleeing the palace from a large snow monster Kristoff notices Anna's hair turning white, so he takes her to the trolls, and there Grand Pabbie explains that her heart has been frozen, only an act of ""true love"" can thaw it, or she will be froze forever, she believes that it is Hans that can do this for her, giving her a kiss to save her life. Hans meanwhile sent a party to find Elsa, and she is captured and imprisoned, she admits to him that she does not know how to reverse the winter spell, and reuniting with Anna she explains the situation of her frozen heart, but he does not truly love her, he only usurped her to steal the throne of Arendelle, he then has her locked up, claiming to the kingdom that she was killed by Elsa, and announces that she will be executed for doing so. Elsa escapes her captivity, while Olaf assures Anna that it is in fact Kristoff that is in love with her, Elsa is led to believe by Hans that she killed her own sister, he is about to make a move to kill her in the middle of the frozen sea, Anna blocks a blow and subsequently freezes solid, Elsa's grieving though is what thaws her because of the sacrifice being the sign of true love. In the end Elsa realises that love is what can help her control her powers, so she is able to bring an end to the eternal winter, and ensuring that Olaf will not melt in the heat of the summer, Hans is sent away to face punishment for his crimes, and Elsa cuts of trading with Duke of Weselton (Alan Tudyk) who was exploiting Arendelle for his own profit, Anna and Kristoff share a kiss and Elsa promises the gates will always remain open. Also starring Chris Williams as Oaken and Jack Whitehall as a troll. The voice casting is all good, the animation is fantastic, it is a charming story, and many of the songs are enjoyable. I am glad I watched it again to get a better opinion, because I maybe previously thought of it as just an excuse for earworm songs, and being more for children, it is actually a very engaging and enjoyable fairytale for adults and children alike, a splendid animated adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Song for ""Let It Go"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!","['saw', 'preview', 'trailer', 'snowman', 'sneeze', 'lose', 'carrot', 'nose', 'opposite', 'side', 'lake', 'reindeer', 'skid', 'towards', 'teaser', 'real', 'disney', 'film', 'reversioning',

The songs were excellent, the performances and animation perfect. I think a stage adaptation should be realised and given as much chance as The Lion King show. It really is as good I think and I'd probably prefer Frozen myself if I had to make a choice between these two films.Everyone who worked on this obviously pulled their weight to realise something very special. It shows that Hollywood can still make great films and adapt/create great stories with some twists. Surprisingly it is in the animation world these days where I think Hollywood is the most consistent making good films.Humour, Drama, Love, Fun all in the right places.

Aside from the ""girliness"" of the film, I found the starting half an hour or so of the film laboured, and it wasn't until this part of the film was over that the stage was set. Compare this with something like Beauty and the Beast which had the stage set in the first ten minutes. Storywise, there seemed to be a few things unanswered for me. Why were the trolls not more involved in dealing with Elsa's condition? Why did the trolls have a relationship with the Christof? Who was running the place whilst Elsa was locked away in her bedroom for umpteen years? I understand it's a kid's movie, and I can see how girls would love it.

1138,6,"This movie was exceptional. It's stuffed with clichés like Anna's pursuit of love. In the third song ""the first time in forever"" she was said ""what if I meet the one?"" I rolled my eyes and was not pleased in the direction that this movie was taking. I don't understand who ran the kingdom and how Anna was never outside? After not seeing each other in 10 years, Anna decides to spend the coronation night with some dude she just met instead of talking with Elsa. Elsa was justified in getting mad at Anna for accepting marriage to Hans. I don't like the powers Elsa has. Where did they come from? Instead of the trolls making her forget everything locking her away until coronation they should have told Elsa to just say no whenever Anna wanted her to ""do the magic"". The powers were confusing because they did not explain the powers' abilities. She can do snow and ice. Sounds reasonable but then she can make a dress...a dress. Made from what? She also gained a full face of makeup at the final line of ""Let it go"". I don't like Olaf and he was slightly annoying. He was sort of funny but is a little in-your-face with his introduction. When we were introduced to Kristoff he was cool and calming but I was baffled when he threw an inappropriate joke into the mix. I like him but I knew Hans would be evil once Anna started showing minor affection to him. The rock trolls' answer to Anna's problem was ""an act of true love"" I was seriously annoyed because that is as generic as it gets when it comes to Disney. If I want to see a groundbreaking film that people make it out to be I want to see the reasons why it's groundbreaking. It's not as good after watching it 3 times. The ending was weird because Hans' sword did not shatter or dent the ice but the sword shattered. I didn't like that. The plot was unclear and it relied on the soundtrack to make the viewer appreciate the film. I like the tone, music, and likable characters, so it's a 6/10","['movie', 'exceptional', 'stuffed', 'clich', 'like', 'anna', 'pursuit', 'love', 'third', 'song', 'first', 'time', 'forever', 'say', 'meet', 'one', 'roll', 'eye', 'pleased', 'direction', 'movie', 'take', 'understand', 'ran', 'kingdom', 'anna', 'never', 'outside', 'see', 'year', 'anna', 'decides', 'spend', 'coronation', 'night', 'dude', 'met', 'instead', 'talk', 'elsa', 'elsa', 'justified', 'get', 'mad', 'anna', 'accept', 'marriage', 'han', 'like', 'power', 'elsa', 'come', 'instead', 'troll', 'make', 'forget', 'everything', 'lock', 'away', 'coronation', 'told', 'elsa', 'say', 'whenever', 'anna', 'want', 'magic', 'power', 'confuse', 'explain', 'power', 'ability', 'snow', 'ice', 'sound', 'reasonable', 'make', 'dress', 'dress', 'make', 'also', 'gain', 'full', 'face', 'makeup', 'final', 'line', 'let', 'go', 'like', 'olaf', 'slightly', 'annoy', 'sort', 'funny', 'little', 'face', 'introduction', 'introduce', 'kristoff', 'cool', 'calm', 'baffle', 'threw', 'inappropriate', 'joke', 'mix', 'like', 'knew', 'han', 'would', 'evil', 'anna', 'start', 'show', 'minor', 'affection', 'rock', 'troll', 'answer', 'anna', 'problem', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'seriously', 'annoyed', 'generic', 'get', 'come', 'disney', 'want', 'see', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'people', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'reason', 'groundbreaking', 'good', 'watch', 'time', 'end', 'weird', 'han', 'sword', 'shatter', 'dent', 'ice', 'sword', 'shatter', 'like', 'plot', 'unclear', 'rely', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'film', 'like', 'tone', 'music', 'likable', 'character']","[1, 1846, 2434, 274, 9, 7, 2553, 6, 715, 11, 36, 20, 287, 35, 244, 10, 985, 336, 1515, 754, 1, 55, 216, 1476, 77, 7, 88, 769, 16, 47, 7, 996, 1031, 343, 773, 1578, 392, 208, 178, 4, 4, 2248, 19, 1314, 7, 869, 1057, 44, 9, 24, 4, 40, 208, 123, 14, 746, 132, 382, 101, 343, 511, 4, 35, 1267, 7, 59, 150, 24, 875, 400, 24, 367, 39, 33, 259, 2188, 14, 907, 907, 14, 27, 1697, 246, 381, 4387, 817, 213, 30, 13, 9, 32, 774, 238, 539, 85, 48, 381, 1304, 736, 67, 556, 3007, 2610, 2236, 2072, 451, 1119, 9, 488, 44, 26, 277, 7, 120, 78, 670, 1333, 834, 123, 1145, 7, 198, 112, 62, 6, 667, 1127, 969, 19, 40, 2, 59, 16, 1546, 3, 46, 14, 59, 16, 180, 1546, 17, 23, 20, 41, 1063, 44, 1277, 3989, 33, 1277, 3989, 9, 52, 4985, 1299, 225, 14, 479, 699, 3, 9, 627, 58, 402, 8]"
1139,7,"I enjoyed this film as an animated children's film. I did get annoyed with several things. The pronunciation of Anna annoyed me greatly, as did the 'wait, what!'. The 'wait, what!' is just too slang like to teach children. Actually, most of Kristen Bell's pronunciation annoyed me, such as pronouncing horrible like whore-able. I didn't understand why Anna couldn't just tell Elsa why, or why she couldn't say, 'I can't tell you, but...'. Instead, she is really horrible towards her sister at the coronation and is actually quite bitchy. I've never met anyone I've gelled with as much. If she hasn't been outside for years she hasn't met many people. It was good breaking the Disney tradition of telling Elsa she couldn't marry someone she had just met. Too many Disney films, The break in the film to the signature song felt too disjointed. This led to the typical, 'upbeat middle' of Disney films, where new happy characters are introduced. The film then returns to the main story at the end, and the new characters are somehow able to be integrated. The twist at the end was quite interesting. I didn't see it coming and I believed that it was the other potential love interest. The concept of her sister was good, even if 'true love's kiss' from her sister was a little weird. It sounded too romantic, so was shocking at the end. I don't know why Elsa loved her sister so much if they had hardly communicated over the years, or her faith in her sister 'she is my sister, she would NEVER hurt me'. It seems a little naive. The songs were quite good. I enjoyed other songs other than the signature 'Let it go'. I still believe, that it sounds like a Eurovision song. However, the score was a let down. The score, or even the songs were no where near the standard of The Lion King.","['enjoy', 'film', 'animate', 'child', 'film', 'get', 'annoyed', 'several', 'thing', 'pronunciation', 'anna', 'annoyed', 'greatly', 'wait', 'wait', 'slang', 'like', 'teach', 'child', 'actually', 'kristen', 'bell', 'pronunciation', 'annoyed', 'pronounce', 'horrible', 'like', 'whore', 'able', 'understand', 'anna', 'tell', 'elsa', 'say', 'tell', 'instead', 'really', 'horrible', 'towards', 'sister', 'coronation', 'actually', 'quite', 'bitchy', 'never', 'met', 'anyone', 'gel', 'much', 'outside', 'year', 'met', 'many', 'people', 'good', 'break', 'disney', 'tradition', 'tell', 'elsa', 'marry', 'someone', 'met', 'many', 'disney', 'film', 'break', 'film', 'signature', 'song', 'felt', 'disjoint', 'lead', 'typical', 'upbeat', 'middle', 'disney', 'film', 'new', 'happy', 'character', 'introduce', 'film', 'return', 'main', 'story', 'end', 'new', 'character', 'somehow', 'able', 'integrate', 'twist', 'end', 'quite', 'interest', 'see', 'come', 'believe', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'concept', 'sister', 'good', 'even', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'sister', 'little', 'weird', 'sound', 'romantic', 'shock', 'end', 'know', 'elsa', 'love', 'sister', 'much', 'hardly', 'communicate', 'year', 'faith', 'sister', 'sister', 'would', 'never', 'hurt', 'seem', 'little', 'naive', 'song', 'quite', 'good', 'enjoy', 'song', 'signature', 'let', 'go', 'still', 'believe', 'sound', 'like', 'eurovision', 'song', 'however', 'score', 'let', 'score', 'even', 'song', 'near', 'standard', 'lion', 'king']","[91, 3, 38, 70, 3, 19, 1127, 608, 43, 5257, 7, 1127, 1316, 415, 415, 5181, 9, 621, 70, 103, 162, 146, 5257, 1127, 2832, 896, 9, 294, 216, 7, 143, 4, 35, 143, 208, 22, 896, 538, 15, 343, 103, 124, 4549, 88, 392, 299, 4250, 31, 769, 47, 392, 61, 46, 17, 340, 2, 1071, 143, 4, 390, 304, 392, 61, 2, 3, 340, 3, 2465, 11, 155, 2972, 248, 376, 1617, 962, 2, 3, 108, 301, 8, 736, 3, 385, 119, 12, 41, 108, 8, 981, 294, 3947, 129, 41, 124, 122, 16, 40, 220, 685, 6, 122, 693, 15, 17, 28, 62, 6, 372, 15, 48, 1063, 259, 393, 666, 41, 56, 4, 6, 15, 31, 976, 47, 2249, 15, 15, 26, 88, 305, 75, 48, 1144, 11, 124, 17, 91, 11, 2465, 30, 13, 68, 220, 259, 9, 4535, 11, 110, 223, 30, 223, 28, 11, 449, 633, 152, 97]"
1140,7,"Disney goes back to its roots of princesses and magical lands in its latest release of ""Frozen."" The main characters are two sister princesses, Anna and Elsa. Anna is a young, cheerful, optimistic protagonist who seeks the love and attention of her sister Elsa. Elsa, is a quiet, introvert that possesses the power of creating and ice snow, which she cannot control, and thus keeps secret from her sister as a means to protect her. The secret becomes exposed and Elsa inadvertently traps the kingdom in an endless winter. It is up to Anna to bring back summer and save her sister from herself. On her journey, she meets a collection of entertaining characters: Christoph, a struggling ice merchant, Sven, Christoph's quiet yet dog-like reindeer, and Olaf, a happy-go-lucky Snowman. One advantage to this new animated feature is the fact that it breaks the norm of many passed Walt Disney shorts. There is no wicked Witch or any evil antagonist in the likes of Ursula from ""The Little Mermaid"" or the Queen from ""Snow White."" The core of the story is the relationship between these two sisters and how one of them is willing to cross wintry lands and climb high mountains to save what she preciously desires. This makes a rather unusual plot device and is no doubt a decent attempt to break away or let go from the old clichés. Simultaneously, the Disney writers throw in plenty of references from past movies such as a true love's first kiss from ""Snow White,"" a ballroom dance sequence inspired from ""Cinderella,"" and anthropomorphic characters like ""Beauty and The Beast."" Paying homage to past films can be a breath of fresh air if done well, however, they can be overburdening. For much of the film, I kept seeing too much of these past Disney references. I felt like I was watching Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Snow White compacted into one. The first thirty minutes alone feels like a contrived musical version of all these movies put together in a bundle. It really is not until the forty minute mark when things become really intriguing with the introductions of Sven, Christoph, and Olaf. They are the ones who make this movie interesting. Besides, who can resist a reindeer with a dog-like personality, a carefree, talking Snowman, and a handsome underdog armed with love advice? Without them, the movie would have been a dull chick flick. The animation is breathtaking. The music is beautiful. The song ""Let it go"" is something to remember for the ages (Idina has quite a vocal range). ""Frozen"" is a movie that I like, but I don't love.

I would recommend this movie to people though, especially because two of the characters were just so stinking cute!","['thought', 'good', 'film', 'nowhere', 'near', 'expect', 'could', 'good', 'bad', 'preview', 'expect', 'sister', 'villain', 'instead', 'fiance', 'bad', 'guy', 'whop', 'five', 'minute', 'movie', 'really', 'much', 'antagonist', 'found', 'odd', 'disney', 'consider', 'main', 'antagonist', 'throughout', 'whole', 'movie', 'felt', 'like', 'movie', 'many', 'musical', 'number', 'almost', 'like', 'creator', 'try', 'pas', 'time', 'feel', 'like', 'story', 'complete', 'plot', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'though', 'especially', 'two', 'character', 'stink', 'cute']","[92, 17, 3, 801, 449, 131, 54, 17, 65, 1568, 131, 15, 104, 208, 5258, 65, 148, 731, 211, 1, 22, 31, 634, 231, 1258, 2, 421, 119, 634, 296, 127, 1, 155, 9, 1, 61, 51, 184, 173, 9, 1053, 87, 1204, 20, 53, 9, 12, 656, 52, 26, 262, 1, 46, 100, 121, 42, 8, 265]"
1142,6,"There was a time in the early to mid-1990s when Disney started making animated movies without musical numbers. I can't tell you how relieved I was. I'm not a big fan of musicals at all. Do I like a lot of the classic films the Mouse House released early on? Of course I do. However, that's not to say I don't take a restroom break or frantically search for the remote to fast-forward through the songs in movies like ""The Jungle Book,"" ""Cinderella,"" and ""Sleeping Beauty.""Parents who share my aversion to musicals can now look forward to suffering through even worse tunes geared towards the pop-infected ears of tween and teens everywhere thanks to ""Frozen."" Before I go into my personal tirade against ""Frozen,"" let me state something very clearly. Children and musical-loving adults will adore the film. Besides its new style of animation, this is a classic Disney outing through and through. There's a princess, a prince, an inanimate object that talks, the dumb peasant who deserves love, and a kingdom in the grips of fear and trouble.Without going into any spoilers, I will say that I was impressed with one plot twist that set ""Frozen"" aside from other Disney movies. Since I'm reflecting on the good found, I'll also mention that the snowman Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad delivering his best impersonation of Jonah Hill I've ever heard) provided just enough comic relief to keep me on the inner edge of sanity.Let's take a moment to reflect on the incredibly annoying theme song ""Let It Go."" Where we once would get operatic and symphonic numbers, we're now cursed to slosh through a whiny pop track tailor-made to be played to death on top 40 radio stations for eternity. Entertainment Weekly's Marc Snetiker described the song as ""an incredible anthem of liberation."" Liberation from what? Being a cartoon character that freezes stuff with her hands? Just keep the gloves on and get over it!If you have kids who enjoyed ""Tangled"" and ""Brave,"" then ""Frozen"" will give them something else to watch. Parents who loved those films will embrace this one as well. If you're like me, you'll find yourself darting out of the room every time someone turns it on.","['time', 'early', 'mid', 'disney', 'start', 'make', 'animate', 'movie', 'without', 'musical', 'number', 'tell', 'relieve', 'big', 'fan', 'musical', 'like', 'lot', 'classic', 'film', 'mouse', 'house', 'release', 'early', 'course', 'however', 'say', 'take', 'restroom', 'break', 'frantically', 'search', 'remote', 'fast', 'forward', 'song', 'movie', 'like', 'jungle', 'book', 'cinderella', 'sleep', 'beauty', 'parent', 'share', 'aversion', 'musical', 'look', 'forward', 'suffer', 'even', 'bad', 'tune', 'gear', 'towards', 'pop', 'infect', 'ear', 'tween', 'teen', 'everywhere', 'thanks', 'frozen', 'go', 'personal', 'tirade', 'frozen', 'let', 'state', 'something', 'clearly', 'child', 'musical', 'love', 'adult', 'adore', 'film', 'besides', 'new', 'style', 'animation', 'classic', 'disney', 'princess', 'prince', 'inanimate', 'object', 'talk', 'dumb', 'peasant', 'deserves', 'love', 'kingdom', 'grip', 'fear', 'trouble', 'without', 'go', 'spoiler', 'say', 'impressed', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'set', 'frozen', 'aside', 'disney', 'movie', 'since', 'reflect', 'good', 'found', 'also', 'mention', 'snowman', 'olaf', 'voiced', 'josh', 'gad', 'deliver', 'best', 'impersonation', 'jonah', 'hill', 'ever', 'heard', 'provide', 'enough', 'comic', 'relief', 'keep', 'inner', 'edge', 'sanity', 'let', 'take', 'moment', 'reflect', 'incredibly', 'annoy', 'theme', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'would', 'get', 'operatic', 'symphonic', 'number', 'curse', 'slosh', 'whiny', 'pop', 'track', 'tailor', 'make', 'played', 'death', 'top', 'radio', 'station', 'eternity', 'entertainment', 'weekly', 'marc', 'snetiker', 'described', 'song', 'incredible', 'anthem', 'liberation', 'liberation', 'cartoon', 'character', 'freeze', 'stuff', 'hand', 'keep', 'glove', 'get', 'kid', 'enjoy', 'tangle', 'brave', 'frozen', 'give', 'something', 'else', 'watch', 'parent', 'love', 'film', 'embrace', 'one', 'well', 'like', 'find', 'dart', 'room', 'every', 'time', 'someone', 'turn']","[20, 594, 1835, 2, 120, 14, 38, 1, 137, 51, 184, 143, 2430, 106, 176, 51, 9, 84, 69, 3, 707, 899, 288, 594, 228, 110, 35, 55, 340, 793, 2983, 780, 571, 11, 1, 9, 1799, 596, 854, 1090, 149, 118, 781, 51, 66, 571, 888, 28, 65, 804, 3696, 538, 658, 4853, 939, 2306, 1457, 879, 1182, 5, 13, 537, 5, 30, 881, 89, 690, 70, 51, 6, 147, 1190, 3, 877, 108, 355, 21, 69, 2, 29, 82, 5231, 1491, 178, 1157, 2939, 592, 6, 77, 2101, 187, 1073, 137, 13, 419, 35, 947, 10, 52, 129, 144, 5, 716, 2, 1, 98, 1384, 17, 231, 27, 348, 45, 32, 521, 275, 257, 1050, 34, 5053, 1930, 81, 357, 458, 164, 309, 297, 154, 1154, 1068, 30, 55, 133, 1384, 603, 238, 226, 11, 30, 13, 26, 19, 5093, 5207, 184, 405, 5125, 658, 932, 2620, 14, 507, 517, 239, 2421, 2689, 3886, 839, 4813, 2516, 11, 549, 3078, 3999, 3999, 314, 8, 282, 698, 323, 154, 1759, 19, 60, 91, 83, 335, 5, 57, 89, 270, 23, 118, 6, 3, 1221, 10, 18, 9, 71, 506, 115, 20, 304, 113]"
1143,8,"Frozen did not particularly capture my attention at first glance. I thought it looked like the second try at Tangled with a quirky and relatable protagonist who just happens to be a princess. Also related was the element of supernatural and the rogue love interest. I believe that Frozen far outshone Tangled in the execution of the storyline and the introduction and development of these characters. Anna, the parallel to Rapunzel, was not expected to be the main character in the movie since her sister, Elsa, was the one with extraordinary powers. Once it was apparent that Anna was the main character, I thought the story would focus on the relationship between her sister and she. However the story took a turn when Anna becomes all alone in a castle full of people and her own sister. As the Pandora's box was opened and hell freezes over. Elsa and her overpowered Iceman\Frozone type abilities flees to the mountains to be free. As Anna sets out to get her estranged sister back, she encounters the other main characters Christoff, Sven, and Olaf. The chemistry between these animated characters was pristine and was perfectly balanced between a comedy and a quaziserious musical. Although the plot was very predicable, I enjoyed seeing it play out. I have alternate theory about the main antagonist. The seemingly ""Prince Charming"" Hans, manipulates everyone until the very end of the movie. However I believe that the main villain was Elsa. Supposedly she could not control her powers at all, even after almost 18 years of isolation trying to perfect them. And then all of the sudden she has complete control and can even uncreate what she has done with a wave of her hand. The only time she seemed truly happy in the movie is when she is alone in her own ice castle worrying only about herself and not caring if she hurt anyone else. That seems more sadistic than Hans to me, but that obviously was not the writers intentions. Overall, this was a fantastic movie and my favorite Disney movie since Aladdin.","['frozen', 'particularly', 'capture', 'attention', 'first', 'glance', 'thought', 'look', 'like', 'second', 'try', 'tangle', 'quirky', 'relatable', 'protagonist', 'happens', 'princess', 'also', 'related', 'element', 'supernatural', 'rogue', 'love', 'interest', 'believe', 'frozen', 'far', 'outshone', 'tangle', 'execution', 'storyline', 'introduction', 'development', 'character', 'anna', 'parallel', 'rapunzel', 'expect', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'since', 'sister', 'elsa', 'one', 'extraordinary', 'power', 'apparent', 'anna', 'main', 'character', 'thought', 'story', 'would', 'focus', 'relationship', 'sister', 'however', 'story', 'take', 'turn', 'anna', 'becomes', 'alone', 'castle', 'full', 'people', 'sister', 'pandora', 'box', 'open', 'hell', 'freeze', 'elsa', 'overpower', 'iceman', 'frozone', 'type', 'ability', 'flees', 'mountain', 'free', 'anna', 'set', 'get', 'estrange', 'sister', 'back', 'encounter', 'main', 'character', 'christoff', 'sven', 'olaf', 'chemistry', 'animate', 'character', 'pristine', 'perfectly', 'balance', 'comedy', 'quaziserious', 'musical', 'although', 'plot', 'predicable', 'enjoy', 'see', 'play', 'alternate', 'theory', 'main', 'antagonist', 'seemingly', 'prince', 'charm', 'han', 'manipulates', 'everyone', 'end', 'movie', 'however', 'believe', 'main', 'villain', 'elsa', 'supposedly', 'could', 'control', 'power', 'even', 'almost', 'year', 'isolation', 'try', 'perfect', 'sudden', 'complete', 'control', 'even', 'uncreate', 'wave', 'hand', 'time', 'seem', 'truly', 'happy', 'movie', 'alone', 'ice', 'castle', 'worry', 'care', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'else', 'seem', 'sadistic', 'han', 'obviously', 'writer', 'intention', 'overall', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'favorite', 'disney', 'movie', 'since', 'aladdin']","[5, 536, 611, 541, 36, 3115, 92, 66, 9, 319, 87, 83, 908, 884, 354, 591, 29, 27, 1312, 401, 3222, 2653, 6, 122, 220, 5, 142, 83, 1534, 295, 1304, 356, 8, 7, 2239, 527, 131, 119, 8, 1, 98, 15, 4, 10, 1582, 24, 1817, 7, 119, 8, 92, 12, 26, 261, 153, 15, 110, 12, 55, 113, 7, 380, 344, 168, 246, 46, 15, 598, 318, 778, 282, 4, 2890, 1908, 5049, 524, 367, 710, 214, 593, 7, 144, 19, 1747, 15, 74, 951, 119, 8, 3958, 181, 32, 1005, 38, 8, 4810, 456, 677, 279, 51, 255, 52, 91, 16, 204, 3926, 5203, 119, 634, 1161, 82, 235, 44, 5259, 109, 41, 1, 110, 220, 119, 104, 4, 1290, 54, 128, 24, 28, 173, 47, 600, 87, 175, 1072, 656, 128, 28, 2256, 323, 20, 75, 329, 301, 1, 344, 33, 168, 1177, 293, 305, 299, 270, 75, 4613, 44, 613, 605, 1659, 166, 253, 1, 189, 2, 1, 98, 485]"
1144,7,"Ciaran:Frozen, one of my favourite movies of 2013. Frozen is the Disney movie i have been waiting for and the result did not disappoint. Frozen captured my imagination as it dove into the topics of adventure,friendship, companionship and the true meaning of 'true love'. The animation in the film was perfect and the dialogue and comedy suited the animation style and the tone of the movie. Being a more mature audience member the story could become predictable at some times, although the story is not intended to capture my age group. I would have to watch the movie again but i was happy that Disney had withheld from placing adult jokes into the movie. Frozen also managed to beautifully blend music into scenes and stunned me with the outstanding animation. I loved Frozen, i don't want to see a sequel as i feel it would only ruin the first. Frozen deserves all praise and deserves every award coming its way. Frozen, fun for everybody- 8/10Bob the Film Guy: I have grown a new outlook and respect for movies targeted at children. I respond to kid's movies that could indeed affect them whether it be inappropriate content or blatant annoying stupid humour that seems to only entertain kids whilst annoying the parents or caretakers. There are movies that are entertaining for all ages even though there target demographic is children. Frozen is one of those movies. I was thrilled and amazed by this movie's desire to make the audience members laugh and show interest and sympathy for the characters and story. The CG animation is spectacular, bright, colourful and beautiful and the song sequences are memorable, powerful and catchy. It also deviates from a few of your average Disney clichés and actually pokes fun at them. There are no talking animals: the feature reindeer doesn't talk but instead the main character speaks for him by reacting to his facial expressions.That is genius. The love aspect of the movie is also made fun of. Usually a Disney romance (except for beauty and the beast) would form over a day or two but instead the main character, Anna, falls in love with a prince whom she just met and her sister and party members are shocked by this. The prince eventually is shown to be nasty and an ice-seller/mountain man turns out to be her main lover.But the romance is not the focus it is secondary to the bond between the two sisters. This movie will be pleasant especially for siblings. Not all clichés die however, a tragic parental death has to occur. Aside from that, this movies deserves all fame and fortune. Get read to kick some ice! Stay cool! Freeze well... I just had to do it.

1145,9,"The review: A great plot, stellar animations, superb writing, and some quality voice acting make this one winter festivity that won't be forgotten anytime soon. Once Elsa runs away from kingdom with some ""issues"", her sister runs after her much to the disliking of her new fiancé Hans, and she soon runs into a strange ice collector named Christoph and a childhood imaginative friend come true Olaf. Cue hilarity, suspense, relationships, action, entertaining musical numbers, surprises, etc. This is definitely a strange movie, and if you had to describe the happenings of it, not only would it be unbelievable, but probably not sounding like a movie most would like to watch. However, when the creators of ""Tangled"" get behind it, it works unbelievably well. The film gets off to a somewhat slow start compared to once it gets moving, but I suppose the film has to get set up. Also, the plot and characters are not even close to realistic.

1146,7,"My initial reaction on seeing the promotional poster for Frozen was disappointment as the character design seemed very generic. But when Anna started to sing ""Do You Want To Build a Snowman"" I was hooked for the rest of the film. The character animation is brilliant and the range of emotion and expression is some of the best I've seen. Anna carries on in the spirit of Tangled giving us a strong female lead with a manic positive energy that evolves into true courage and love when the final challenge comes. Elsa is equally strong as the sister tormented by the very power that makes her special eclipsed in the film's showcase song ""Let It Go"". Olaf, the wide eyed innocent snowman, reminded me of the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz in that he doesn't have a skull, or bones or much of a brain. He has a good running gag with Kristof's moose concerning a carrot. Speaking of Kristof, the one minor criticism I have is the male characters in the film. While they provided charming enough support characters they lack the dimension of the female leads. It's a fine line to walk between having a strong male character storyline when you have a female lead but in some ways Tangled was more successful because the male character had a strong internal conflict to resolve whereas the men in Frozen seem primarily to only be reacting to the situation at hand. All in all, however, Frozen is great family fun that both adults and children can enjoy and I can't get ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman "" out of my head.","['initial', 'reaction', 'see', 'promotional', 'poster', 'frozen', 'disappointment', 'character', 'design', 'seem', 'generic', 'anna', 'start', 'sing', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'hooked', 'rest', 'film', 'character', 'animation', 'brilliant', 'range', 'emotion', 'expression', 'best', 'see', 'anna', 'carry', 'spirit', 'tangle', 'give', 'u', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'manic', 'positive', 'energy', 'evolves', 'true', 'courage', 'love', 'final', 'challenge', 'come', 'elsa', 'equally', 'strong', 'sister', 'torment', 'power', 'make', 'special', 'eclipse', 'film', 'showcase', 'song', 'let', 'go', 'olaf', 'wide', 'eyed', 'innocent', 'snowman', 'remind', 'scarecrow', 'wizard', 'oz', 'skull', 'bone', 'much', 'brain', 'good', 'run', 'gag', 'kristof', 'moose', 'concern', 'carrot', 'speak', 'kristof', 'one', 'minor', 'criticism', 'male', 'character', 'film', 'provide', 'charm', 'enough', 'support', 'character', 'lack', 'dimension', 'female', 'lead', 'fine', 'line', 'walk', 'strong', 'male', 'character', 'storyline', 'female', 'lead', 'way', 'tangle', 'successful', 'male', 'character', 'strong', 'internal', 'conflict', 'resolve', 'whereas', 'men', 'frozen', 'seem', 'primarily', 'react', 'situation', 'hand', 'however', 'frozen', 'great', 'family', 'fun', 'adult', 'child', 'enjoy', 'get', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'head']","[2969, 1653, 16, 2484, 5, 1038, 8, 424, 75, 969, 7, 120, 63, 59, 202, 45, 2503, 303, 3, 8, 21, 523, 958, 240, 1069, 34, 16, 7, 853, 767, 83, 57, 177, 167, 237, 248, 5115, 503, 1338, 62, 1689, 6, 817, 1589, 40, 4, 1169, 167, 15, 3188, 24, 14, 316, 5197, 3, 2125, 11, 30, 13, 32, 1226, 1814, 1315, 45, 1047, 2282, 3273, 3311, 2614, 31, 1242, 17, 233, 1725, 1230, 1503, 1844, 1146, 641, 1230, 10, 670, 1091, 431, 8, 3, 458, 235, 164, 740, 8, 273, 3579, 237, 248, 470, 213, 669, 167, 431, 8, 295, 237, 248, 50, 83, 814, 431, 8, 167, 1517, 552, 1298, 1565, 459, 5, 75, 2013, 2114, 867, 323, 110, 5, 25, 72, 125, 147, 70, 91, 19, 59, 202, 45, 317]"

1153,7,"Latest Disney animation feature is very loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson's The Snow Queen and opens with two royal sisters, Anna and Elsa, playing as children when Anna is accidentally hurt by Elsa's magical power of turning things to ice and snow. As a result, Elsa is convinced to suppress her powers and isolates herself in the castle from Anna. When Elsa must take the throne and appear publicly, her powers become apparent and she flees the kingdom, unwittingly leaving it in eternal winter. Determined to bring her sister back to reverse the curse, the flighty kind-hearted Anna leaves her spur-of-the-moment fiancé Hans in charge, coerces mountain man Krystof and his pet reindeer to lead her into the wintry wilderness to save the kingdom and help redeem her sister in the process.Credits claim this film adaptation is ""inspired"" by The Snow Queen, although other than Elsa's magical power, there is not very much else in common with the source. The film itself is beautiful to look at, almost painfully mature in its thoughts and insight, and more than a tad overrated.The central characters of Anna and Elsa (voiced by Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, respectively) and the dynamics of their relationship are fascinating and in ways not usually found in Disney animated features. There is a large degree of intelligence and imagination at work here. If the story worked as well with the supporting characters, this would probably be a masterpiece. This is most definitely a female-driven film (although this will not prevent young boys from enjoying it), so it is probably not a surprise that the male characters get short shrift, but the film falls short in other areas as well.Much like Bond films, Disney films are often only as good as their villains. Frozen quite simply does not have oneor not until the final moments when it conjures one up out of its butt crack. Much of the conflict in the film is internal, with Elsa desperately trying to suppress her powers so that she does not hurt anyone and the public does not regard her as some kind of freak. When she finally flees and embraces her powers, she does so at the cost of isolation from everyone and everything. This is all very interesting and adult, but cannot take the place of a good old-fashioned villain. As the film heads towards its climax, it seems even the writers must understand this because a here-to-fore perfectly amenable character is drafted for villainy and it just fails to ring true based on the character's behavior throughout the film. This is not just a minor problem, but a large problem from which the film never completely rights itself.While Elsa and Anna are incredibly delineated roles, the other characters fare less well. Hans is introduced in a rather amusing ""meet-cute"" with Anna, but does not have much to do other than be goofily handsome, hold down the fort and then rush into the wintry landscape to prevent Elsa from being harmed by vigilantes storming her winter fortress. Krystof is introduced as a child, but has minimal contact with the sisters and nothing to do with the story until Anna drafts his help. Since his specialty is ice, we anticipate he might melt Elsa's heart when they meet, but they never actually meet and his character basically feels like a time-consuming fifth wheel that gets dragged or inserted into certain sequences because there ""must"" be a guy there. The asides the film gives him with his reindeer are mildly amusing, but should have been better developed – indeed the film could use a larger jolt of humor. And it is perfectly inexcusable that Jonathan Groff (as Krystof) and Santino Fontana (as Hans), two Broadway stars with terrific voices, are given nothing of worth to sing. I don't think Groff even has one number. I also find the magical snowman Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad) to be incredibly irritating. Perhaps it is Gad's voice or mannerisms incorporated into the character, but Olaf goes from harmless to fingernails on the chalkboard at warp speed – and the film never does explain how Elsa inadvertently manages to bring him to life anyway.Other than the anthemic power-ballad ""Let It Go,"" I don't find any of the other songs (what few there are) to be anything special. ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" feels no better than minor filler and neither the number given Olaf nor the number with the trolls prove memorable or advance the plot in any way.That said, it is really hard to dismiss the film, thanks to its animated beauty and its fascinating central characters. The message of the importance of being true to oneself and not suppressing one's abilities, nicely limned in ""Let It Go"", is a good one and one that can be universally appreciated by anyone (child or adult) who feels they are being kept down. All combine to make this a thoughtful and worthwhile Disney entry, if not the classic its fans would quite have you believe.","['late', 'disney', 'animation', 'feature', 'loosely', 'base', 'han',

Lastly, As the Title the story line is also ""Frozen"" cold.The characters are not well developed in the story and are not attached firmly to it except the chosen few.well mix of emotions but they are not deep enough as they should be.It feels like going to the theater just to watch the 3D effect.Felling Deeply saddened by the fact that the enormous prospect of the story line is wasted and hoping that they some how would be able to make a sequel with much better story line.And this Film would have deserved a two stars but for the amazing 3D effects and obviously ""Olaf"".I must say that it was amazing intention in story but kinda lagged when in came out So,Story (superficially)-4 (deep)-6(contained not only hint or gentle touch but a big smack of feminism only,other details that Disney was famous for lacked so [6]) Avg - 5Sound - 7 (unneeded musicals but still great because of one or two ""the great ones"" mentioned above) Animation - 9*(get ready to jump off your seats)Characters - 8(beautifully created and with a hint of mystery) Total Avg -

1156,10,"It starts like a renaissance classic, great and big and totally delivers. You know you are watching a future classic that could be the Beauty and the beast for this generation. It starts awesomely and maintains that giant classic feel throughout. The moment it started i knew i was witnessing a classic. And then amazing songs like those of the Big Four started coming in succession and a story like that of the classics. Instead of being like dreamworks, the story was true to old school Disney. A great story that really gets you emotionally involved to the point of tears. There is comedy but that takes a back seat to the dramatic center of the movie which really stands out as being deep and heartbreaking. It has that dark and somber tone throughout. I read everywhere that people are saying Frozen is the best Disney musical in generations. That is so true. I loved it better than The Lion King. It is a story about Anna who is trying to connect with her older sister Elsa not knowing her sister is in so much ache riddled with guilt and trapped and blaming herself for a deadly accident of the past.

1157,6,"As much as I enjoyed watching Frozen, I would not consider this movie Pixar's best animated film. But that is not to take anything away from it. The aspects of Frozen that make it a great watch are its visuals, interesting characters, bright comedy, and, of course, the soundtrack. The animation in this movie is superb and delivers some of the greatest visuals of all the Pixar movies. The characters are fun and interesting and make watchers care about them, which I find to be an important aspect of a story. The comedy is meant mainly for a younger audience but is still entertaining and what gives the film such a bright character. And finally, the music in Frozen is absolutely beautiful and probably the strongest point of this movie along with its visuals. As for the story, it is truly a unique one but some of the major events of the plot seem a bit predictable at times. I hate to criticize a great film, but much of the story seems a bit lacking in originality. In fact, Frozen reminds me a lot of Tangled. Overall, though, Frozen is a fun and beautiful movie. Even without an original and particularly unique plot, the film is touching and is spectacular in ways that many other movies aren't. I give it a 7.5 out of 10 and definitely recommend to anyone that they watch it.","['much', 'enjoy', 'watch', 'frozen', 'would', 'consider', 'movie', 'pixar', 'best', 'animate', 'film', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'aspect', 'frozen', 'make', 'great', 'watch', 'visuals', 'interest', 'character', 'bright', 'comedy', 'course', 'soundtrack', 'animation', 'movie', 'superb', 'delivers', 'great', 'visuals', 'pixar', 'movie', 'character', 'fun', 'interest', 'make', 'watcher', 'care', 'find', 'important', 'aspect', 'story', 'comedy', 'meant', 'mainly', 'young', 'audience', 'still', 'entertain', 'give', 'film', 'bright', 'character', 'finally', 'music', 'frozen', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'probably', 'strong', 'point', 'movie', 'along', 'visuals', 'story', 'truly', 'unique', 'one', 'major', 'event', 'plot', 'seem', 'bit', 'predictable', 'time', 'hate', 'criticize', 'great', 'film', 'much', 'story', 'seem', 'bit', 'lack', 'originality', 'fact', 'frozen', 'reminds', 'lot', 'tangle', 'overall', 'though', 'frozen', 'fun', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'even', 'without', 'original', 'particularly', 'unique', 'plot', 'film', 'touch', 'spectacular', 'way', 'many', 'movie', 'give', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'watch']","[31, 91, 23, 5, 26, 421, 1, 194, 34, 38, 3, 55, 212, 101, 443, 5, 14, 25, 23, 267, 122, 8, 1425, 279, 228, 225, 21, 1, 904, 1143, 25, 267, 194, 1, 8, 125, 122, 14, 3807, 293, 71, 289, 443, 12, 279, 868, 934, 73, 159, 68, 243, 57, 3, 1425, 8, 241, 58, 5, 292, 93, 210, 167, 117, 1, 172, 267, 12, 329, 414, 10, 823, 618, 52, 75, 95, 331, 20, 333, 1339, 25, 3, 31, 12, 75, 95, 273, 1378, 201, 5, 1044, 84, 83, 166, 100, 5, 125, 93, 1, 28, 137, 230, 536, 414, 52, 3, 260, 671, 50, 61, 1, 57, 174, 262, 299, 23]"

1161,8,"It's now just over a year since Frozen - the highest grossing animated film of all time - first came out in cinemas. And it's still massive business. This Christmas just gone, merchandise was all over the place. At Christmas-themed public attractions, Frozen characters often seemed almost as essential as Santa. A sing-along version was re-released in cinemas. And ""Let It Go"" was being used in non-Disney adverts.I've wanted to write something about Frozen for a while; maybe I held off because I couldn't think of much new to say when it's already been pulled apart so much. I first saw it on DVD some months after it was out in cinemas, and I felt it was one of the best Disney films to come out in some time.The story feels quite different from many other classic Disney films. It doesn't have very much in common with its original source material, Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" - only that there's a queen with powers over winter, and there's some trekking in the wilderness involved. Instead, the writers took the basic concepts from the original story and turned it into a completely different entity, one that so much can be done with. The relationship between the sisters Elsa and Anna is at the heart of the story, but there's also how Elsa has to cope with having such power, a bit of romance, and the overall quest to bring summer back to the land - and all these layers are generally balanced very well. Admittedly, maybe the third act is a bit fast and feels slightly anti-climactic as a result, but that's not a significant flaw.Report this adAmongst all this, Frozen brings some twists to expected traditions in family films (i.e. the nature of true love and the role of the prince), but without being heavy-handed about it and shouting to the audience ""Look! You see how clever we're being?"" It's funny how this film successfully incorporates these unique aspects while still slotting into the general category of Disney fairytale films - as opposed to say, Enchanted, which was designed to make fun of the Disney formula. The subversions in Frozen don't feel forced or awkward at all; they're just part of the story.The characters are all very likeable in their own way. Disney seems to be making their princesses more three-dimensional by putting them through psychological torment: after having Rapunzel be a victim of emotional abuse, we now have Elsa suffering through mental and actual isolation, and hiding a very important aspect of herself while being terrified of the consequences should anyone find out. Watching her personal journey is very compelling, and sometimes quite painful. While Anna is closer to a traditional Disney princess - innocent, cheerful, dreaming of true love - the film explores just why she ended up the way she is, and gives her some unique quirks as well.I was expecting to be intensely annoyed by Olaf the snowman, but he's hardly even irritating; he's actually very pleasant and funny. Perhaps it's because he's not so in-your-face as some other comic relief sidekicks. And I find Prince Hans, who turns out to be the main villain, really fascinating. Unfortunately we don't get to see much of him being evil, since it only comes out around the beginning of the third act, but it adds an extra level of intrigue when you're watching the film again and observing his apparently benevolent behaviour. He manipulates Anna perfectly and he seems very good at improvising. When he first meets Anna, did he already know who she was - and is he going for a basic 'awkward friendliness' approach before he reads her more and tailors his interactions with her appropriately? It's a level of thought and cunning I really like to see in a villain, rather like what I thought of Mother Gothel in my Tangled review.The soundtrack is a real standout, and probably another reason why this film has done so well. With the possible exception of the troll song, it's just like the soundtracks of the best known Disney Renaissance films, in that the songs are very catchy and very amenable to being sung along to. Some people may be just as annoyed by ""Let It Go"" as they were by ""My Heart Will Go On"" once upon a time, but I still enjoy listening to it. And the animation is superb, too: not just the beauty of the winter landscapes, but the subtleties of the characters' expressions - again, much like Tangled.Report this adSo why is this film so popular, then? The quality of the songs probably helped. Plus the wintery theme allowed it to fit in well with Christmas, even though Christmas itself doesn't factor into the film at all. (Frozen was released in the UK before Christmas 2013, as opposed to, say, Big Hero 6, which came out in the US in November but will only be out in the UK later this month.) There's the appeal and likeability of the two main characters, especially for children. And, like I said, Frozen really stands out among other Disney films while still being another enjoyable fairy tale.If there is indeed a sequel, as has been strongly suggested for the future, I'd definitely go and see it. There are plenty of directions in which the story could continue: Elsa still has work to do as queen and may need to work on public relations; there may be extra layers to her abilities that she hasn't figured out yet; they could introduce a new villain or bring back one from the first film. Expectations for a sequel would certainly be high, and it probably wouldn't be quite as good as the first film - but then, Toy Story 2 managed it.So, to sum up, one of Disney's finest - maybe some of the hype is over the top, but it would be wrong to call it undeserved.

1163,7,"Frozen is a good film. Not amazing, and defiantly not the best since the Lion King, but it is a good film. The story is quite obviously reminiscent of the Renaissance era of Disney, and it does a great job at reviving that energy. However, of course with Disney trying to stay fresh, the film challenges some of the ideologies of the 90s Disney films. Some work, some don't.
Anna, Christoff and Olaf are a great comedic trio. They all have their own set of goals (other than olaf who is quite obviously just there for comic relief) and their disagreements become amusing because of this. That's probably the best I can say about the characters, because the other two main characters of the film aren't all that great.
Let's start with Elsa: At a young age, she was locked into isolation by her parents to keep Anna away from her dangerous powers. Once their parents died, or better yet, once Anna was no longer a child, Elsa should reveal her powers to Anna, because keeping it a secret is no longer going to help her. But instead she waits until the worst time possible, causing her to run away from her problems, and everyone who is willing to help her. If Elsa had just revealed her powers, then Anna and Elsa's relationship could have been built up stronger, causing the ""act of true love"" scene at the end to be much more powerful. As Olaf describes true love, it is ""putting someone else's needs before theirs."" Elsa NEVER does this in the movie. Also how on earth did hugging Anna stop the frozen summer? It was made quite obvious that Elsa's powers are controlled by her anxiety, but loving your sister does not kill your anxiety.
However, Elsa is not the worst character in the film. That goes to the villain of this film. Hans. So for the entire movie, Hans is, and therefore acts, as if he is Anna's humble boyfriend who wants to protect her. However in the last 15 minutes of the film, it is revealed that he is actually an evil psychopathic murderer who is trying to commit treason. Literally every action before this reveal presents Hans as a very different character. And yes, I know it is because he is acting, but in the times he isn't acting, like when he smiles at Anna after falling in the water, he is still being the ""nice"" Hans. Also, if his plan was to eventually kill Elsa, then why did he save her life from those two guys trying to murder her? All he had to do was let them kill her, and then deal with Anna when he gets back to the Castle.
Despite all of this criticism, I still think this movie is good. The story is compelling, the good characters are cute, even some of the comedy is pretty good. I like what they were trying to do, with making the villain the man Anna had just fallen in love with, and with Anna having her sister break the ice spell, but in the context of the story, it doesn't necessarily work well. Which is a shame since it could have easily been fixed with a better script and character writing.
Frozen 2 is coming out this Friday, and I judging by the trailers, it looks much more mature and will deal more with Elsa's character. It honestly looks great, and I'm excited to see it. Let's just hope it isn't ruined with questionable character writing.","['frozen', 'good', 'film', 'amaze', 'defiantly', 'best', 'since', 'lion', 'king', 'good', 'film', 'story', 'quite', 'obviously', 'reminiscent', 'renaissance', 'era', 'disney', 'great', 'job', 'revive', 'energy', 'however', 'course', 'disney', 'try', 'stay', 'fresh', 'film', 'challenge', 'ideology', 'disney', 'film', 'work', 'anna', 'christoff', 'olaf', 'great', 'comedic', 'trio', 'set', 'goal', 'olaf', 'quite', 'obviously', 'comic', 'relief', 'disagreement', 'become', 'amuse', 'probably', 'best', 'say', 'character', 'two', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'great', 'let', 'start', 'elsa', 'young', 'age', 'lock', 'isolation', 'parent', 'keep', 'anna', 'away', 'dangerous', 'power', 'parent', 'die', 'well', 'yet', 'anna', 'longer', 'child', 'elsa', 'reveal', 'power', 'anna', 'keep', 'secret', 'longer', 'go', 'help', 'instead', 'wait', 'bad', 'time', 'possible', 'cause', 'run', 'away', 'problem', 'everyone', 'willing', 'help', 'elsa', 'reveal', 'power', 'anna', 'elsa', 'relationship', 'could', 'built', 'strong', 'cause', 'act', 'true', 'love', 'scene', 'end', 'much', 'powerful', 'olaf', 'describes', 'true', 'love', 'put', 'someone', 'else', 'need', 'elsa', 'never', 'movie', 'also', 'earth', 'hug', 'anna', 'stop', 'frozen', 'summer', 'make', 'quite', 'obvious', 'elsa', 'power', 'control', 'anxiety', 'love', 'sister', 'kill', 'anxiety', 'however', 'elsa', 'bad', 'character', 'film', 'go', 'villain', 'film', 'han', 'entire', 'movie', 'han', 'therefore', 'act', 'anna', 'humble', 'boyfriend', 'want', 'protect', 'however', 'last', 'minute', 'film', 'reveal', 'actually', 'evil', 'psychopathic', 'murderer', 'try', 'commit', 'treason', 'literally', 'every', 'action', 'reveal', 'present', 'han', 'different', 'character', 'yes', 'know', 'act', 'time', 'act', 'like', 'smile', 'anna', 'fall', 'water', 'still', 'nice', 'han', 'also', 'plan', 'eventually', 'kill', 'elsa', 'save', 'life', 'two', 'guy', 'try', 'murder', 'let', 'kill', 'deal', 'anna', 'get', 'back', 'castle', 'despite', 'criticism', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'compelling', 'good', 'character', 'cute', 'even', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'good', 'like', 'try', 'make', 'villain', 'man', 'anna', 'fall', 'love', 'anna', 'sister', 'break', 'ice', 'spell', 'context', 'story', 'necessarily', 'work', 'well', 'shame', 'since', 'could', 'easily', 'fix', 'well', 'script', 'character', 'write', 'frozen', 'come', 'friday', 'judging', 'trailer', 'look', 'much', 'mature', 'deal', 'elsa', 'character', 'honestly', 'look', 'great', 'excite', 'see', 'let', 'hope', 'ruin', 'questionable', 'character', 'write']","[5, 17, 3, 96, 2386, 34, 98, 152, 97, 17, 3, 12, 124, 613, 2149, 465, 942, 2, 25, 373, 3306, 1338, 110, 228, 2, 87, 510, 819, 3, 1589, 2, 3, 107, 7, 3958, 32, 25, 1043, 2837, 144, 2525, 32, 124, 613, 309, 297, 179, 828, 210, 34, 35, 8, 42, 119, 8, 3, 25, 30, 120, 4, 73, 139, 382, 600, 118, 154, 7, 101, 702, 24, 118, 368, 18, 182, 7, 612, 70, 4, 528, 24, 7, 154, 508, 612, 13, 135, 208, 415, 65, 20, 673, 328, 233, 101, 198, 109, 1549, 135, 4, 528, 24, 7, 4, 153, 54, 787, 167, 328, 112, 62, 6, 90, 41, 31, 439, 32, 3954, 62, 6, 196, 304, 270, 99, 4, 88, 1, 27, 1776, 1236, 7, 284, 5, 205, 14, 124, 595, 4, 24, 128, 2530, 6, 15, 286, 2530, 110, 4, 65, 8, 3, 13, 104, 3, 44, 264, 1, 44, 1241, 112, 7, 3875, 3679, 59, 513, 110, 197, 211, 3, 528, 103, 277, 5200, 87, 2912, 1181, 643, 115, 345, 528, 663, 44, 140, 8, 325, 56, 112, 20, 112, 9, 914, 7, 186, 1013, 68, 192, 44, 27, 776, 652, 286, 4, 111, 79, 42, 148, 87, 2544, 30, 286, 701, 7, 19, 74, 168, 313, 1091, 68, 37, 1, 17, 12, 1239, 17, 8, 265, 28, 279, 136, 17, 9, 87, 14, 104, 145, 7, 186, 6, 7, 15, 340, 33, 858, 1470, 12, 1284, 107, 18, 1403, 98, 54, 403, 1012, 18, 395, 8, 165, 5, 40, 5193, 2593, 394, 66, 31, 1022, 701, 4, 8, 542, 66, 25, 447, 16, 30, 384, 851, 3299, 8, 165]"

1165,7,"I am so not the demographic that this film is made for that I hope I can be forgiven for not loving it. A big part of this is that I just don't love the Pixar animation style, and I don't think this film makes particularly good use of that technology. There were a couple of sequences that jumped out at me for being too obviously motion-captured in a way that took me out of the film.Being someone who's spent most of my life in a Frozen style climate, I was also uncomfortable with the unrealistically light clothing the characters wore in the snow and ice--in a non-animated world they would all be disfigured by severe frostbite if not struck down by hypothermia. You can tell this was a film written, designed and executed in Southern California. I could also tell this was made to be seen in IMAX, and trace the direct line from the snow antics in this to the new Grinch (also the big reindeer sidekick.)I don't remember the specifics of the original Hans Christian Andersen story, except that I found it ultra-creepy when I read it as a child. I do think the filmmakers did a good job of Disneyfying it as well as introducing the Bechdel-friendly element of making the protagonists two sisters instead of boy-girl sweethearts.

Finally, two little girls can play princesses from the same movie at the same time!One of the things that made me hesitate to watch this for so long was the ghastly ""Goofy"" look of Olaf. Josh Gad did absolute wonders in making this hideously designed character not only tolerable but a pleasure to listen to if not watch.","['demographic', 'film', 'make', 'hope', 'forgiven', 'love', 'big', 'part', 'love', 'pixar', 'animation', 'style', 'think', 'film', 'make', 'particularly', 'good', 'use', 'technology', 'couple', 'sequence', 'jumped', 'obviously', 'motion', 'capture', 'way', 'take', 'film', 'someone', 'spent', 'life', 'frozen', 'style', 'climate', 'also', 'uncomfortable', 'unrealistically', 'light', 'clothing', 'character', 'wore', 'snow', 'ice', 'non', 'animate', 'world', 'would', 'disfigure', 'severe', 'frostbite', 'struck', 'hypothermia', 'tell', 'film', 'write', 'design', 'execute', 'southern', 'california', 'could', 'also', 'tell', 'make', 'see', 'imax', 'trace', 'direct', 'line', 'snow', 'antic', 'new', 'grinch', 'also', 'big', 'reindeer', 'sidekick', 'remember', 'specific', 'original', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'story', 'except', 'found', 'ultra', 'creepy', 'read', 'child', 'think', 'filmmaker', 'good', 'job', 'disneyfying', 'well', 'introduce', 'bechdel', 'friendly', 'element', 'make', 'protagonist', 'two', 'sister', 'instead', 'boy', 'girl', 'sweetheart', 'suspect', 'real', 'secret', 'film', 'success', 'two', 'awesome', 'princess', 'one', 'movie', 'finally', 'two', 'little', 'girl', 'play', 'princess', 'movie', 'time', 'one', 'thing', 'make', 'hesitate', 'watch', 'long', 'ghastly', 'goofy', 'look', 'olaf', 'josh', 'gad', 'absolute', 'wonder', 'make', 'hideously', 'design', 'character', 'tolerable', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'watch']","[1645, 3, 14, 384, 3387, 6, 106, 94, 6, 194, 21, 355, 37, 3, 14, 536, 17, 158, 1379, 398, 502, 4869, 613, 1507, 611, 50, 55, 3, 304, 992, 79, 5, 355, 2475, 27, 3073, 3001, 735, 2136, 8, 5080, 39, 33, 1085, 38, 126, 26, 3665, 1367, 143, 3, 165, 424, 1450, 1603, 54, 27, 143, 14, 16, 3660, 3895, 721, 213, 39, 2551, 108, 3431, 27, 106, 151, 436, 391, 1586, 230, 44, 245, 339, 12, 474, 231, 2990, 3969, 547, 70, 37, 2403, 17, 373, 18, 736, 5247, 837, 401, 14, 354, 42, 15, 208, 408, 76, 1845, 195, 508, 3, 577, 42, 338, 29, 10, 1, 241, 42, 48, 76, 204, 29, 1, 20, 10, 43, 14, 3254, 23, 169, 961, 66, 32, 275, 257, 1798, 532, 14, 424, 8, 1914, 2119, 531, 23]"

1167,7,"This review contains spoilers.Frozen is a three-dimensional animated movie that premiered in 2013. The movie is an animated movie in a fantasy setting. The movie is about a princess and her younger sister as they try to stop a magical icestorm.Frozen is in many ways a simple movie. This movie is a simple tale about two sisters that love each other and believe it can overcome conflict. All of the other plots the movie has besides this is superfluous. The main plot that the two sisters Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel, and Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, are the main focus here. They also deliver good performances in the vocal portions of the movie.For a family animation, Frozen is more of a child focused movie. There are as pects that adults will, like, in this movie, but much of it is aimed at children. There are not many adult themes in this movie. The movie has many cute characters like Olaf, voiced by Josh Gad. These characters offer little in the way of the plot but offer fun comic relief.In some ways, Frozen can be considered as a deviation from standard Disney animations. There are love sub-plots but it is deviating from the other Disney animations. The romance plots are not the focus here. Elsa and Anna's relations are the focus instead. There are romance subplots but these are more in the background.I would recommend Frozen. The movie is a solid family animation.Grade: B","['review', 'contains', 'spoiler', 'frozen', 'three', 'dimensional', 'animate', 'movie', 'premier', 'movie', 'animate', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'set', 'movie', 'princess', 'young', 'sister', 'try', 'stop', 'magical', 'icestorm', 'frozen', 'many', 'way', 'simple', 'movie', 'movie', 'simple', 'tale', 'two', 'sister', 'love', 'believe', 'overcome', 'conflict', 'plot', 'movie', 'besides', 'superfluous', 'main', 'plot', 'two', 'sister', 'elsa', 'voiced', 'idina', 'menzel', 'anna', 'voiced', 'kristen', 'bell', 'main', 'focus', 'also', 'deliver', 'good', 'performance', 'vocal', 'portion', 'movie', 'family', 'animation', 'frozen', 'child', 'focus', 'movie', 'pects', 'adult', 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'aim', 'child', 'many', 'adult', 'theme', 'movie', 'movie', 'many', 'cute', 'character', 'like', 'olaf', 'voiced', 'josh', 'gad', 'character', 'offer', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'offer', 'fun', 'comic', 'relief', 'way', 'frozen', 'consider', 'deviation', 'standard', 'disney', 'animation', 'love', 'sub', 'plot', 'deviate', 'disney', 'animation', 'romance', 'plot', 'focus', 'elsa', 'anna', 'relation', 'focus', 'instead', 'romance', 'subplots', 'background', 'would', 'recommend', 'frozen', 'movie', 'solid', 'family', 'animation', 'grade', 'b']","[161, 1054, 419, 5, 433, 751, 38, 1, 4369, 1, 38, 1, 545, 144, 1, 29, 73, 15, 87, 284, 170, 5, 61, 50, 516, 1, 1, 516, 114, 42, 15, 6, 220, 1009, 552, 52, 1, 877, 2952, 119, 52, 42, 15, 4, 521, 141, 116, 7, 521, 162, 146, 119, 261, 27, 1050, 17, 493, 821, 2073, 1, 72, 21, 5, 70, 261, 1, 147, 9, 1, 31, 859, 70, 61, 147, 226, 1, 1, 61, 265, 8, 9, 32, 521, 275, 257, 8, 705, 48, 50, 52, 705, 125, 309, 297, 50, 5, 421, 633, 2, 21, 6, 2043, 52, 3326, 2, 21, 363, 52, 261, 4, 7, 1635, 261, 208, 363, 2213, 617, 26, 262, 5, 1, 664, 72, 21, 1552, 1569]"

1169,6,"Because before the critic reviews rolled around, Frozen didn't exactly have the best buzz going around about it; Mainly in the form of, ""Please let me kill that annoying snowman."" And, as if it wasn't enough that people were afraid if animated Jar Jar Banks was coming our way, then we had an animator interview that basically confirmed everything wrong with the corporate attitude of creating female characters for animation. But, frankly Tangled had an equally annoying comedy heavy trailer, and THAT movie turned out great. I reserved judgement until I saw the whole film, and how is it? Ugh.... okay, I kind of admit that I have a problem: I have this INSANE tendency to expect movies from Pixar and Disney to always be AMAZING, and I mean 'make you cry and laugh, lift you from your body and go on an amazing journey', epic levels of amazing. But frankly, that's just not healthy. Not only does it set you up for unrealistic expectations, and if the movie doesn't match ALL your excited anticipation of the ""best movie ever,"" even a great movie will seem disappointing. And yes, it is Disney, which means that the movies are made for families. But I also have to say that I don't believe in pulling any punches, just because it's a family movie. Pixar movies have the reputation they do, not because the critics went EASY on them because they were FAMILY movies, it's because they're movies that work for everyone. And while it's certainly important to understand for which demographic the movie was made, that doesn't excuse it from CRITICISM.I think that Frozen is a perfectly FINE movie, if all you really want is a cute, funny, and harmless mini-adventure story featuring two female characters, impeccably designed so that they won't bother feminists, but that Disney can still make money off merchandising them as princesses. But if you want a FANTASTIC, interesting story with characters you can emotionally connect with, this probably isn't it.Now on the positive side, the animation is GORGEOUS. It's not textured, Dream Works gorgeous, but lovely, colourful, active. And of course, given its visual theme, the film LOVES to show you everything it can do with ice and snow, and indeed, the ice and snow looks AMAZING.I do think the female leads are a bit paper-thin. But the snowman? He's, fine! He's even effectively entertaining! He IS funny, but in a good-natured, likable way. I do like his voice, and for the most part, he's not annoying!
Speaking of which, this movie IS also a musical. In general, I find the music okay. Kind of on the same level as Princess and the Frog and Tangled, I can't really pretend that the songs are as good as the great ones from the 90's, but there have been at least two songs from each of those movies that I liked. Including Frozen. The first song is the one played right at the beginning of the film. Then there's the BIG song of the film, and it's the song that Elsa sings, where she REALLY gets to show off what she can do with her powers. Plus, the music with the animation of her using her powers goes together BEAUTIFULLY. Then the rest of the songs are cute, but mediocre.And then of course, there's the story. Remember when Brave came out, and how everyone's consensus was kind of, ""It's not that I didn't like it, I was just expecting it to be a bit... BETTER."" Well, that. And it's not just because it really forces in the comedy whether it works or not. It's just that the characters' chemistry just isn't there. And it's not from a lack of effort to try and flesh out these characters, it's just that the story doesn't let them DO that much. As for Elsa, for example: You think she's going to be the villain, but she's not. You think it's going to be this complicated situation where she'll really GROW as a character, but it's not. Every that happens, she basically does by accident. Elsa is basically reserved and scared of her powers, but she is the one character with a real CONFLICT. So why on earth does the movie focus on ANNA as the main protagonist? Which isn't to say TOO much against her, who's personality is caring, but excitable and funny. While I think that Anna's goofiness can eventually irritate SOME people, there's nothing wrong with her besides her not having a lot to do. Because, not much in this movie really feels like anything's at stake. I mean the whole movie takes place in two days! I do like that the story is about two SISTERS, and while they DO show a genuine connection at the start of the film, we never really see that closeness again. Their interactions throughout most of the film are them reciting the same lines at each other, over and over.And in the end, my problem with the movie, is it's about how much the film tries to keep the emotion at an arm's length because, ""It has to be a fun comedy! Because that's what the kids like now, right?!"" This movie just feels like it's aiming for young kids, and I know, it's just a silly kiddie movie, that's all they wanted to make. Well congratulations Disney, you've succeeded! And I know that sounds like a lot of bile but believe me when I say I have NOTHING against anybody who goes to this film and enjoys it. If anything, I'm JEALOUS of those people.","['critic', 'review', 'roll', 'around', 'frozen', 'exactly', 'best', 'buzz', 'go', 'around', 'mainly', 'form', 'please', 'let', 'kill', 'annoy', 'snowman',

As someone who grew up with the start of the Disney/Pixar partnership and the Disney renaissance resulting in classic films like the Lion King and the Little Mermaid, I was eager to see how it turned out..Frozen is a technically brilliant film, Idina Menzel is brilliant as Elsa, but if you realize it is actually based on a fairy tale written 170 years ago by Hans Christian Andersen (i.e. The Snow Queen) you know there is going to be a happy ending like all fairy tales which sort of spoils the ending. It is a good film in all and I enjoyed it, but I do not put it in the top echelon of Disney flicks like Toy Story, A Bugs Life, The Lion King, Snow White, I could name more that are better.","['finally', 'get', 'around', 'watch', 'frozen', 'year', 'release', 'positive', 'review', 'say', 'best', 'disney', 'film', 'year', 'someone', 'grow', 'start', 'disney', 'pixar', 'partnership', 'disney', 'renaissance', 'result', 'classic', 'film', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'little', 'mermaid', 'eager', 'see', 'turn', 'frozen', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'film', 'idina', 'menzel', 'brilliant', 'elsa', 'realize', 'actually', 'base', 'fairy', 'tale', 'write', 'year', 'ago', 'han', 'christian', 'andersen', 'e', 'snow', 'queen', 'know', 'go', 'happy', 'end', 'like', 'fairy', 'tale', 'sort', 'spoil', 'end', 'good', 'film', 'enjoy', 'put', 'top', 'echelon', 'disney', 'flick', 'like', 'toy', 'story', 'bug', 'life', 'lion', 'king', 'snow', 'white', 'could', 'name', 'well']","[241, 19, 200, 23, 5, 47, 288, 503, 161, 35, 34, 2, 3, 47, 304, 285, 120, 2, 194, 2, 465, 648, 69, 3, 9, 152, 97, 48, 422, 3320, 16, 113, 5, 1790, 523, 3, 141, 116, 523, 4, 428, 103, 256, 219, 114, 165, 47, 683, 44, 245, 339, 893, 39, 49, 56, 13, 301, 41, 9, 219, 114, 539, 1056, 41, 17, 3, 91, 196, 239, 2, 805, 9, 463, 12, 1995, 79, 152, 97, 39, 365, 54, 183, 18]"

Happened to everyone I spoke to that watched it; I even have a few adult friends that love everything Disney walk out of the theater in the first 40 minutes. Overall: Go watch the movie, first time you see the movie it will suck, second time you see it you will love it.","['reason', 'movie', 'success', 'olaf', 'seriously', 'begin', 'sense', 'humor', 'bit', 'awkward', 'music', 'overall', 'amaze', 'love', 'song', 'love', 'plot', 'twist', 'fiance', 'end', 'evil', 'olaf', 'perfect', 'sense', 'humor', 'weird', 'vibe', 'make', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'definitely', 'take', 'kid', 'watch', 'adult', 'first', 'huh', 'olaf', 'appear', 'happen', 'everyone', 'spoke', 'watch', 'even', 'adult', 'friend', 'love', 'everything', 'disney', 'walk', 'theater', 'first', 'minute', 'overall', 'go', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'suck', 'second', 'time', 'see', 'love']","[180, 1, 577, 32, 667, 160, 217, 222, 95, 810, 58, 166, 96, 6, 11, 6, 52, 129, 5258, 41, 277, 32, 175, 217, 222, 1063, 2240, 14, 1, 364, 174, 55, 60, 23, 147, 36, 2737, 32, 582, 290, 109, 2753, 23, 28, 147, 327, 6, 132, 2, 669, 312, 36, 211, 166, 13, 23, 1, 36, 20, 16, 1, 1202, 319, 20, 16, 6]"
1172,7,"Disney princesses really seem to be on the upswing these days. With  2010's Tangled making a splash and Pixar's Brave (2012) doing it's  thing, not only does there seem to be a resurgence in Micky Mouse  regality but it's one of a different stripe. Gone are the days when  Jasmine was saved from the clutches of Jafar by Aladdin (1992) and the  smart but naïve Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) was saved by  Prince Eric. These girls are here to kick ass and take names and to  that I say it's about damn time.  It started with The Princess and the Frog's (2009) Tiana. Sure she ends  up with her undeserving lothario noble but the principle lesson in The  Princess and the Frog is you got to forge your own success, no one else  is going to do it for you. Female independence wins out; hazah! Then  along came Rapunzel in Tangled; at first a little too bubbly for my  taste and she did marry the hero who came to save her, but she saved  him via tear. Not exactly a women's lib lesson but at least she saved  him and not the other way around. Then Brave completely changed the  game by ignoring the love angle altogether, focusing on a mother  daughter relationship and a woman's intent on making her own way in  life.  Now we come to Frozen (2013), a movie that once again challenges the  assumptions of old Disney in favor of a more liberating storyline. Elsa  (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) are two princesses who live a  sheltered life in their palace. The gates almost never open for good  reason as Elsa has the power of frost and freezing she cannot control.  She keeps it a secret to almost everyone including her spitfire sister.  But after their parents die and Elsa is coroneted Queen, The gates open  and Anna is introduced to her prince in shining armor (Santino  Fontana). Elsa objects to a sudden marriage proposal and inadvertently  unleashes her power. While Elsa chooses to hide away in the mountains,  Anna vows to return her to the throne and put an end to their kingdom's  eternal winter.  Of course on her journey, Anna discovers colorful friends including a  gruff mountain man named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), his trusty reindeer  Sven and a magical snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). And when things get  rough and Anna's prince turns from kind to Kind Hearts and Coronets  (1949), the one thing that makes the whole ordeal worthwhile is true  love right? Well in a way.  If you want to know more about how Frozen brazenly walks the path set  by recent Disney and newer animated features in general you'll just  have to watch it. Let's just say that Frozen does have a lot of strong  themes that challenge viewers young and old without being cruel and  cold. The detail in the animation is breathtaking and almost everything  works about this film.  If Frozen has faults they're similar to that of Tangled. Both make the  choice to be musicals which isn't inherently a bad thing but there is a  standard to reach. Unfortunately while songs like Let it Go and Do You  Want to Build a Snowman are superb, the soundtrack as a whole just  doesn't reach the apex of Disney classics like The Lion King (1994) or  Beauty and the Beast (1991). Additionally there just seems to be a  staggered way the songs are infused into the story. Some you see coming  while others just kind of pop out at you. Sorry but if I had my choice  I want a little warming up before you come barging in three minutes  into the scene with In Summer.  Overall however, Frozen is far from a frigid experience. The Disney  musical machine has finally awoken from its slumber and will once again  bring children the joys of growing up with a song in their heart. And  while the heroes and heroines may have matured and the technology has  changed drastically, there is still room for movies like Frozen.","['disney', 'princess', 'really', 'seem', 'upswing', 'day', 'tangle', 'make', 'splash', 'pixar', 'brave', 'thing', 'seem', 'resurgence', 'micky', 'mouse', 'regality', 'one', 'different', 'stripe', 'go', 'day', 'jasmine', 'save', 'clutch', 'jafar', 'aladdin', 'smart', 'na', 'ariel', 'little', 'mermaid', 'save', 'prince', 'eric', 'girl', 'kick', 'take', 'name', 'say', 'damn', 'time', 'start', 'princess', 'frog', 'tiana', 'sure', 'end', 'undeserving', 'lothario', 'noble', 'principle', 'lesson', 'princess', 'frog', 'get', 'forge', 'success', 'one', 'else', 'go', 'female', 'independence', 'win', 'hazah', 'along', 'come', 'rapunzel', 'tangle', 'first', 'little', 'bubbly', 'taste', 'marry', 'hero', 'come', 'save', 'save', 'via', 'tear', 'exactly', 'woman', 'lib', 'lesson', 'least', 'save', 'way', 'around', 'brave', 'completely', 'change', 'game', 'ignore', 'love', 'angle', 'altogether', 'focus', 'mother', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'woman', 'intent', 'make', 'way', 'life', 'come', 'frozen', 'movie', 'challenge', 'assumption', 'old', 'disney', 'favor', 'liberate', 'storyline', 'elsa', 'idina', 'menzel', 'anna', 'kristen', 'bell', 'two', 'princess', 'live', 'shelter', 'life', 'palace', 'gate', 'almost', 'never', 'open', 'good', 'reason', 'elsa', 'power', 'frost', 'freeze', 'control', 'keep', 'secret', 'almost', 'everyone', 'include', 'spitfire', 'sister', 'parent', 'die', 'elsa', 'coroneted', 'queen', 'gate', 'open', 'anna', 'introduce', 'prince', 'shin', 'armor', 'santino', 'fontana', 'elsa', 'object', 'sudden', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'inadvertently', 'unleashes', 'power', 'elsa', 'chooses', 'hide', 'away', 'mountain', 'anna', 'vow', 'return', 'throne', 'put', 'end', 'kingdom', 'eternal', 'winter', 'course', 'journey', 'anna', 'discovers', 'colorful', 'friend', 'include', 'gruff', 'mountain', 'man', 'name', 'kristoff', 'jonathan', 'groff', 'trusty', 'reindeer', 'sven', 'magical', 'snowman', 'name', 'olaf', 'josh', 'gad', 'thing', 'get', 'rough', 'anna', 'prince', 'turn', 'kind', 'kind', 'heart', 'coronet', 'one', 'thing', 'make', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'worthwhile', 'true', 'love', 'right', 'well', 'way', 'want', 'know', 'frozen', 'brazenly', 'walk', 'path', 'set', 'recent', 'disney', 'newer', 'animate', 'feature', 'general', 'watch', 'let', 'say', 'frozen', 'lot', 'strong', 'theme', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'young', 'old', 'without', 'cruel', 'cold', 'detail', 'animation', 'breathtaking', 'almost', 'everything', 'work', 'film', 'frozen', 'fault', 'similar', 'tangle', 'make', 'choice', 'musical', 'inherently', 'bad', 'thing', 'standard', 'reach', 'unfortunately', 'song', 'like', 'let', 'go', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'superb', 'soundtrack', 'whole', 'reach', 'apex', 'disney', 'classic', 'like', 'lion', 'king', 'beauty', 'beast', 'additionally', 'seem', 'stagger', 'way', 'song', 'infuse', 'story', 'see', 'come', 'others', 'kind', 'pop', 'sorry', 'choice', 'want', 'little', 'warm', 'come', 'barging', 'three', 'minute', 'scene', 'summer', 'overall', 'however', 'frozen', 'far', 'frigid', 'experience', 'disney', 'musical', 'machine', 'finally', 'awoken', 'slumber', 'bring', 'child', 'joy', 'grow', 'song', 'heart', 'hero', 'heroine', 'may', 'mature', 'technology', 'change', 'drastically', 'still', 'room', 'movie', 'like', 'frozen']","[2, 29, 22, 75, 138, 83, 14, 4585, 194, 335, 43, 75, 707, 10, 140, 13, 138, 2542, 111, 3951, 485, 1001, 2777, 1915, 48, 422, 111, 82, 76, 1699, 55, 183, 35, 1480, 20, 120, 29, 659, 3301, 207, 41, 4463, 2541, 2907, 499, 29, 659, 19, 3452, 577, 10, 270, 13, 237, 3163, 374, 172, 40, 527, 83, 36, 48, 2242, 1120, 390, 544, 40, 111, 111, 3037, 748, 522, 251, 499, 250, 111, 50, 200, 335, 291, 209, 925, 1079, 6, 2065, 2820, 261, 883, 389, 153, 251, 4514, 14, 50, 79, 40, 5, 1, 1589, 64, 2, 2005, 3626, 295, 4, 141, 116, 7, 162, 146, 42, 29, 224, 3138, 79, 383, 964, 173, 88, 318, 17, 180, 4, 24, 1686, 282, 128, 154, 508, 173, 109, 349, 15, 118, 368, 4, 4109, 49, 964, 318, 7, 736, 82, 2034, 3725, 688, 665, 4, 1491, 1072, 1057, 3149, 1274, 1884, 24, 4, 3331, 676, 101, 214, 7, 3867, 385, 952, 196, 41, 77, 310, 105, 228, 337, 7, 1859, 1427, 327, 349, 214, 145, 183, 67, 455, 377, 2263, 151, 181, 170, 45, 183, 32, 275, 257, 43, 19, 2057, 7, 82, 113, 193, 193, 80, 10, 43, 14, 127, 4782, 1907, 62, 6, 130, 18, 50, 59, 56, 5, 669, 1347, 144, 399, 2, 2056, 38, 229, 623, 23, 30, 35, 5, 84, 167, 226, 1589, 479, 73, 64, 137, 2452, 366, 468, 21, 905, 173, 132, 107, 3, 5, 1011, 446, 83, 14, 862, 51, 2557, 65, 43, 633, 1046, 573, 11, 9, 30, 13, 59, 202, 45, 904, 225, 127, 1046, 2, 69, 9, 152, 97, 149, 203, 3207, 75, 50, 11, 5102, 12, 16, 40, 247, 193, 658, 777, 862, 59, 48, 362, 40, 433, 211, 90, 205, 166, 110, 5, 142, 3537, 334, 2, 51, 2456, 241, 221, 70, 738, 285, 11, 80, 544, 565, 171, 1022, 1379, 209, 4908, 68, 506, 1, 9, 5]"
1173,9,"Ever since the last 2D film ""Home on Range"", in which Disney was going to fully turn to CG for their own films outside of Pixar. Films like Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons, while somewhat enjoyable, lacked A lot compared to Disney films of the past. After bumps in the road with only Pixar and their overrated live action Disney channel show to turn in profit, along came Tangled. I thought it was advertised horribly in their first trailer, but it was interesting to see Disney finally return to their traditional ""Princess"" films while combining it with CG. When I finally saw it, I loved it all, songs, characters, story, animation, everything. After that, we got Wreck It Ralph, which was a massive step for Disney, especially with handling what was supposedly rumored to be a video game cameo clusterfudge, and turning it into a brilliant ""Toy Story""ish tale with a very fresh and gratifying message in the end. And now we have the latest from Walt Disney studios: Frozen.With films like Tangled and Wreck It Ralph impressing me enough to even consider them some of my favorite Disney films, surpassing even past 2D films in the 90's, I held high expectations for this film, and it did not disappoint.I am going to get what little bad out of the way, because this film gave me very little to gripe about. First was the exploiting the comedy relief in the aspect that Tangled succeeded with, specifically the deer acting extremely dog-like, similar to Maximus (best Disney horse ever). Even so, this was our first Disney reindeer, and thus more memorable since we would have forgotten him if he was a horse. Secondly, the troll song number seemed very out of place. Though I liked the trolls design and their ""roll"" in the fate of both Elsa and Anna, their song was not exactly needed, but all the same not terrible (still got some chuckles out of me).And the rest is fantastic! The story is extremely fresh, and though it really didn't follow the original source material, Disney took the story and did an excellent job using the concept and making their own wonderful storyline. It centers around two princesses, sisters named Elsa and Anna. While young an accident occurred when Anna got hurt by Elsa's ice magic. Terrified of hurting anybody ever again, Elsa closed herself off from the world and even her family. I don't want to spoil anything outside of that, but I will say that this tale takes some unexpected turns and has two pretty surprising twists towards the end! Point being, very well told story.The songs, what can I say, some of the most beautiful I've heard in years from Disney musical animated features. Elsa's song ""Let It Go"" is one of the most gorgeous and cathartic of musical numbers I've ever heard, and I took listening to that track alone several times after seeing the film.Everyone seemed to be split on the comedy relief Olaf, I read either he's hilarious, tolerable, or flat out annoying... I thought he was pretty funny, and he definitely has his hilarious moments as well. He's even a useful comedic character, he was never their for just giggles.The animation is undeniably stunning, Disney took advantage of the fact they were going to be working with snow and ice, and it shines through. Again, along with Elsa's ""Let It Go"" song, her display of showing off her incredible and beautiful powers of ice is simply amazing to look at.I can only hope Disney keeps this streak going, always aiming to make their films better and better, and taking new chances and twists whenever needed and doing it right to please their audience. Frozen is a film that takes new chances and succeeds in all the right places, and has very little to be disappointed with, if anything really. Memorable story and characters, gorgeous soundtrack and animation, I give Frozen a 9.5 out of 10! Keep it up Disney!","['ever', 'since', 'last', 'film', 'home', 'range', 'disney', 'go', 'fully', 'turn', 'cg', 'film', 'outside', 'pixar', 'film', 'like', 'chicken', 'little', 'meet', 'robinson',
